TransferWise just rolled out its new mint green debit card a couple of days ago and I've yet to see any discussion about whether it's worth it to get the card if one already has the YouTrip card. Primarily using it for travel and spending overseas.

I've been using YouTrip for some time now and it works okay but their customer support is atrocious and would love to switch if TransferWise is any better.

6,I am going to lose my mom,dj4j2n,2019-10-17 10:37:06,"I am crying, desperate, shock and helpless.

Background: my family comes from a difficult yet manageable financial background and i have 5 other siblings. Growing up, and still am, i dont usually notice the struggles of my family, they hid their problems so close to themselves and only ask for help at the very last minute.


So, 3 years before, my mom got an offer for financial help by some random stranger online. Being a desperate working mother with 6 kids to support , . The stranger mention to my gullible mom that the business they own were legitimate and the money is too. 
Obviously me and my sister tried to prove to her that it was in fact a scam, however she went over how the little extra money thats she's getting for helping the transaction can  help pay off some bills. 
She went forward with the offer from a stranger
 Im not really sure of the details of the exchange but a week later, she is recieving huge amounts of money to be transacted to another account. Obviously given our financial status it raised suspicion from the people at the bank, they froze her account for that suspicion , and the account was under an investigation. 

however the random stranger didnt stop just there, they still needed a middle person to transact more money, and being the gullible person my mom is, she went ahead and proceeded to open another account at another bank. this kept going;opening and closing of accounts. 

till there wasnt any bank left that would let her open accounts. so the scammer still found ways to illegally transfer money by using my mom as a guinea pig. 
this went on, till the police caught up, and questioned my mother. 

of course with the police involved, my mom now stopped being a Guinea pig. 

jumped to 3 years later(now) 
an investigation officer, went over her case, and are now charging her offences that she unknowingly/negligently commited. 3 charges in total, and are pretty big ones. 

people might say, that she would be let off easily since it was her 1st offence, but it wasnt. 
remember when i mentioned she got her bank account froze and then she opened another one? 
well that counts as another offence. 

Right now, my sister just bailed her out from a temporary lock up, for reasons im not sure of. 
The Investigating Officer(IO) then explained to my mom and my sister about the charges, and obviously they begged for their dear life for the charges to be drop(obviously, i told my sister and mom thats not how justice system works)  

therefore now we're here, where we're struggling to know whats going to happened and what things we need to do,
for the lack of better words, we're just helpless.
my dad keeps on explaining to my mom, thats the charges arent that serious, but it is.
My dad's an egotistical conservative authoritarian. so even when i try to explain the charges thats being charged, to my dad but he takes everything lightly.

so im at loss and helpless.
we have no money for a lawyer, my mom doesnt know whats going on because my dad's blinding her with lies. To also add, my mom has been saving(legitimate money) to go for a pilgrimage which obviously its going to devastate her when she is sentenced to a prison time.

right now, my sister and i, just discussed plans on how our family is going to survive without her. I am ashamed to also admit that my family depends on my mom too much. my dad works too but he gambles, or idk what he does with his money. 

i seriously cant bare the thought of losing my mom, and being in her shoe. 

im posting this long ass, story in hopes that someone can help us, im not sure how, but im seriously desperate. so please, please, if a miracle exist, please let something good happen to my family finally, or just this once.

I currently just got back to Singapore from uni abroad and have a couple of guitars I need to get adjusted/fixed such as fixing a warped neck and pickup height (stuck and slanted) along other things I need done. Many years ago I used to go to a Swee Lee in East Coast as they had a workshop etc but nowadays the Swee Lee's are looking more and more like guitar boutiques so i was wondering if anybody knows of another place I can get mine serviced. They're relatively high end guitars, which is why i'm not keen on just taking them anywhere but at the same time don't wanna just spend loads of money for no reason.

Father is the biggest problem, do nothing and only contribute negativity and always psycho my mom and talk shit and I have been keeping quiet all the time until I had lost it and exploded at them. So they became salty, mom stopped giving me allowance since last month. Father psycho my mom to stop paying for my phone bill and school fees too. Father even want to ruin my future and said when my school fees isn't paid, I would get expelled and mindef would call me to enlist.. wasting my 2 years in poly and not getting my diploma and getting impromptu enlistment.

Furthermore, he threatened to not give me any of their supporting documents if I were to apply for poly bursary next year. They even said it straight to my face that if I'm unhappy with them, I can move out, which is so ridiculous as I'm still a student. Is like telling me to fly when I can't even crawl?? What stupid statement is that.

I reached out to whatever help there is.. social service, school and even the court, all helpless. Even the court ownself tell me they couldn't help?!?!?? So what can I do now??

For those who wants to know some context, you can continue reading below

Things hasn't been going well ever since and it's going downhill steeply. Since my previous post, I helped my family get 2 room HDB rental. After we moved in, I'm the one doing all the work, searching for flat to view, arranging appointments, literally doing agent's work and being parent's financial planner. However, the USELESS father of mine have been so picky and still want to see what fengshui when they don't even have money to play with. Needless to say people who are poor, normal people would get what's within their means. But this useless father have the requirements of a fucking millionaire. Even give him strike million dollar lottery, no house could please him, even a freaking bungalow.

FYI, one time just cos father was nostalgic to the times when we lived in sembawang when I'm still a kid, they optioned a house there on impulse, knowing that the very first owner had loan shark case and then backed out afterwards and I was the one who got the deposit back for them. A second time when we found the perfect house at a good price and optioned it, father backed out last minute again and went mia on our agent. That point of time my mom is even against him and sick of his shit.

And now the tables have turned. Father psycho mom until they've purchased BTO. a fucking 3 room flat which I wouldn't have a room (I have 2 sis). When in the first place we could've buy 4 room and it's contradicting that parents are the ones who said not to get 3 room because it's not feasible and next time were to sell, cannot profit (LOL still want to think until there? see how ignorant they are).

What worse, if they want to buy a 3 room now, they could afford, even if it's flat that just MOP. They have fucking poor judgement. You guys can do the math. Now monthly rental is $380+ per month plus town council fee, let say $400. Having to pay $400 for the next 5 years till we get the BTO, that already $24,000. They rather spend that amount over 5 freaking years to live in a shit environment and pathetic 2 room rental flat, than to buy a 3 room flat now that can be 94 years lease left. Just because they want a brand new flat with 99 years? The BTO they bought is about $250K plus $50K levy which a total of $324K could get a good 3 room now or even a budget 4 room. Plus by that time I would be out working and can move out on my own. I need a proper home now

I did so much and rather everything for them. After using me and this is how I get treated? They don't even recognise all the shit I did for them. They even said I do nothing and only leach on all the benefits like what? One very ridiculous example is that paying singtel bill by singtel dash give an extra GB of data and father said I don't contribute to the phone bill but being a freeloader. I was even being thoughtful for them in case I exceed data.

LOL fucking end my life already. these kind of parents where to find. Seriously im fucking depressed right now. Someone just bail me out and I'm even looking for a guardian right now. Seriously what can I do? I have no control and i am powerless.. seriously i didn't ask to be born into such mess.. I already did what I could

Edit 1: To add on more. Mentioned in my previous post, father hasn't been working for as long as I could remember, even till now. He REFUSE to work. He only happened to worked part time for about 2 months recently so he could have some spare cash for himself and his 2-3 packs of cigg everyday. What's stupid is that he could've work 3 months of full time just for the sake of getting a higher loan amount to buy a decent 4 room flat. BUT HE REFUSED. It doesn't make any fucking sense and it's so contracting cos he said one reason he not want work is cos I wouldn't be eligible for bursary. FUCK SAKE. I rather have a home then having a $2k bursary one time a year.. He could give me allowances to make up for the loss of bursary. and the irony that now they are the ones preventing me from applying my bursary LOL. Just imagine how fucking poor his judgement are. Sacrificing to get a deceent home for a small $2k bursary which wouldn't mean a thing compared to a much bigger loan they could get, and now sabotaging me to not get bursary. In the end it's all lose-lose",,85,0.84

95,PSA: You can opt out of mailbox spam delivered by SingPost (AdMail) if you have a lockable mailbox that has a master door for the postman to deliver mail,di3a7k,2019-10-15 05:35:14,"Link is here: https://www.singpost.com/contact-us/service-enquiry

Select:

* Service Type: Postal
* Category: Advertising Mail
* Sub Category: OPT-OUT Service

I live in a block where you can lock the shutter of your mailbox so that you don't have to deal with all sorts of random spam, but I was still having to deal with all the useless crap that SingPost would deliver to me on a frequent basis. So I called SingPost some time ago and asked them if there was a way to opt out, and there is!

I figured that opting out was a better alternative than wasting all that paper (hey, at least the ball is out of my court now) and also wasting my time grabbing all the junk just to deliver it straight to the trash. Not to mention it's highly annoying how everyone just throws all the spam on the floor or on top of the postbox itself.

Bear in mind that SingPost was a little draggy with my request. After I submitted the first form, they sent me an email asking for almost the exact same questions again in order to be really sure that I wanted to opt out (dot dot dot). Once the process is complete they'll stick a ""NO ADMAIL"" sticker inside your mailbox and you'll be done!

Some months have passed now since I completed the opt out process and the amount of ""noise"" in my mailbox has drastically reduced. Like I really don't get any spam anymore. This also means it's a lot less likely that I'll accidentally throw away some legitimate mail that has been stuck under a heap of junk.

I'm a university undergrad from the US about to graduate with my degree in engineering this Spring. Back in 2018, I did an exchange semester at NTU, and was thoroughly impressed with the city and country you all call home. Singapore checks all the boxes on my list regarding the urban lifestyle that I want to lead. I want to move there so badly that it is one of the only things in my life that has not diminished in interest level for 1 whole year. The only thing that is keeping me from moving from the US upon graduation is income.

I have a job in the US lined up right now that pays $110,000 SGD (per year) straight away, and then starts to quickly pay more - around $137,000 SGD 18 months after I start working there, and the pay keeps going up from there. By contrast, the particular engineering role that interests me in Singapore pays about $4000 SGD per month, or about $48,000 SGD per year, which is less than half of what I would make here in the states. I know that taxes are lower, true, but it is still significantly less money. This disparity in income is the only thing holding me back from immediately moving to Singapore.

I have a few questions:

* Is this pay of $4000/month accurate for most students coming out of university? How quickly does this income increase?
* Am I even looking at the right job? (one of my sg friends told me most engineering students go into engineering management roles since ""engineer"" means more like manual labor in Singapore... is this correct?)
* What is someone's actual income after a year? I have heard that some companies add on a bonus at the end of the year to people's paychecks. Is this true?
* How valuable is a Master's degree to Singaporean/international companies in Singapore?

This one is going to be a bit esoteric, and the primary document is a 75 page legal essay that I don't think everyone is going to read. So the TDLR is:

\- Chan Sek Keong has written an article that essentially puts forward the argument that 377A is in conflict with Article 12 of the constitution

\- His argument (very briefly) is that due to changes in the law the purpose behind 377A is no longer applicable and hence there is no reasonable basis for 377A to discriminate against men. As such, 377A is not compatible with Article 12 of the constitutional (the ""equality article""). This argument is relatively novel, and was not used in the previous 377A cases.

\- This article was published yesterday, just weeks before the 377A court hearings in the High Court next month

\- The merits of the legal arguments aside, this is a pretty remarkable intervention by a former CJ, just before a case is to be heard by the Court.

&#x200B;

Summary paragraph:

*133 The conclusions and submissions of this article on the decisions of the Courts on the constitutional validity of s 377A are as follows:*

*(a) Section 377A was not intended to cover penetrative sex, that is, anal or oral sex, when it was enacted in 1938 as the same offences had already been covered by s 377 since 1872. Section 377A covers only non-penetrative sex, such as masturbation and other kinds of sexual touching and “lewd” acts.*

*(b) In so far as the Courts have decided that s 377A does not violate the fundamental rights of equality before the law and equal protection of the law on the basis that s 377A covers penetrative sex, the decisions are not binding on lower courts as being given per incuriam.*

*c) If so, it is open to an applicant or defendant in a new action or prosecution to contend that s 377A violates Art 12(1) on the ground that it unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminates against male homosexuals in respect of acts of gross indecency of a non-penetrative nature.*

*(d) If s 377A had been enacted to criminalise penetrative sex covered under s 377, it would have the effect of impliedly repealing the same offences in s 377. If s 377A had impliedly repealed those offences in s 377 in 1938, those offences criminalised by s 377A would have been impliedly repealed by s 376(1)(a) in 2007 to the extent of their inconsistency, that is, with respect to consensual penetrative sex between males.*

*(e) Under s 376(1)(a), consensual penetrative sex between males in private is no longer criminalised as an unnatural offence (because s 377 has been repealed) but is punishable under s 20 of the Minor Offences Act or s 294(a) of the Penal Code, if performed in public.*

*(f) The legislative purpose or object of s 377A determined at the time of its enactment in 1938 will always remain the same thereafter. Accordingly, the retention of s 377A by Parliament in 2007 does not affirm or reaffirm its 1938 purpose.*

*(g) Section 377A was enacted for the purpose of dealing with the mischief of male prostitution and its associate activities (which involved male homosexual conduct) which were rife in 1938, and not because male homosexual conduct was not acceptable in Singapore society in 1938.*

*(h) The purpose of s 377A as described in (g) above ceased to exist or was no longer valid in 2007 or 2013, or there was no evidence that similar conditions existed in 2007 or 2013. Accordingly, the legislative classification (or differentia) would no longer be reasonable and would not have rational relation to the purpose of s 377A (having ceased to exist). Section 377A therefore cannot satisfy the requirements of the reasonable classification test and therefore violates Art 12(1).*

*(i) Section 377A, being a pre-constitution law, cannot be declared void for unconstitutionality because Art 162 requires any existing law to be construed to conform to the Constitution. Accordingly, the court has to interpret s 377A by reading it to have a meaning that does not violate the Constitution. How s 377A should be construed (or read) to conform to the Constitution depends on the nature of its inconsistency with Art 12(1).*

*(j) If the purpose of s 377A has ceased to exist in 2007 or 2013, s 337A may be construed to conform to the Constitution by reading it as a gender-neutral provision that criminalises non-penetrative sex of gross indecency committed in public.*",,120,0.9

134,Sharing My Bariatric (Weight Loss) Surgery Journey,dhox1c,2019-10-14 10:54:50,"Long read ahead:


So I want to share some personal journey. Last Feb I went for bariatric surgery, that’s a weight loss surgery more specifically I did the gastric sleeve where they cut my stomach by 80% so I eat very little and feel super full real fast. 

For context, I am female, 36 this year and 1.68m. I was very active before, did Muay Thai and MMA but one training session some time in 2012, my back gave way and I had to stop. I did more than just stop, I completely let myself go since and gained so much weight over the years. Just before the surgery, I went in at 105kg - the heaviest I’ve ever been. I decided to do something about it and over nearly a year period of consultations, research and monitoring, I finally did the surgery. 

It wasn’t an easy journey, and there have been plenty of learnings. I want to debunk some misconceptions about weight loss surgery primarily that it is a “quick, lazy way” to lose weight because I’ve had some hard core people coming at me about it (it’s all about exercise and food!!!! they screamed at me). Some obese people have dire urgent need to lose weight quickly because of various reasons commonly diabetes or severe sleep apnea. They do not have the luxury of that 1-2 years it takes to lose weight the “natural way”. Losing weight quickly via surgery helps them to then maintain and in the support group, it’s been proven that it works as it drastically drops the % of risk in just 3 months post surgery in the case of diabetes and heart problems. In the first year post op we have dieticians working to help us develop good eating habits so that we can continue on the journey afters ourselves. 

2 weeks pre surgery I was prescribed strict liquid meal placement 3 times a day. It was so fucking hard for someone who loves food. Post surgery was even harder it was 1 month of clear fluids which means I can only drink clear soup/broth and just sips of water. Then it was 2 weeks of blended meals, followed by 1 month of soft meals then gradually regular food. I can now only stomach maybe 1 spoon of rice, 2 spoons size meat and a spoon veg. But I am able to workout again without feeling pain everywhere - it was painful to exercise when your entire body weight is slamming on your knees and ankles. I sleep better at night, don’t feel sleepy during the day and my back doesn’t ache just to name a few good stuff that came out of it. I’ve had to make some life adjustments regarding eating especially since a lot of our lives revolve around food - social gathering, festivities, birthdays, team lunches, client lunch meetings are so hard because everyone’s like oh you’re not eating? that’s all you ordered? and I wasn’t about to start telling everyone this longass story.

I have dropped approx. 30kg since March and am now at 74. The plan given is over a 10-month period to get to my ideal weight of 68kg. I will be on meds for the next 2 years with medical appointments every other month. Some side effects: hair loss for up to 8 months post op due to loss of nutrients, potentially throwing up a lot as your body adjust to your food intake.  

Now cost-wise, because I have severe sleep apnea and pre-diabetic, this is considered a medical surgery. A lot of tests to be done to determine this. If you don’t have any medical issues, they will not do it for you or it will be considered cosmetic. To which you’re not eligible for any medical subsidies. You have to be Singaporean for the standard health care subsidies (I am). The total cost of my surgery incl. hospital stay (C class) is S$16k (without any further post op complications). As a Singaporean and with medical conditions, you’re eligible for up to 40% subsidy, and the balance can be paid via Medisave (depends on your income, up to a certain amount). At the end of it all, I only paid S$360 IN CASH. Do note that various appointments (Surgeon, Dietician, blood tests, sleep tests etc) leading up to surgery at the hospital (I went to CGH) will cost individual sums, avg. of $30-40. 

I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about the journey in the comments if I miss any info. I encourage you to go for some talks, hospitals hold bariatric talks regularly and are free. Talk to them and find out more even if it’s just for research. 

TLDR: I went for a weight lost surgery and it isn’t as easy as everyone thinks it is but that shit was worth it.

After reading all the online comments and vitrol over the issue, I felt that it was important to do a bit of research into how NS deferment (specifically for sports, please) was handled, and how, in my humble opinion, the issue is really much simpler than what many make it out to be, and that (probably unpopular opinion here) Ben Davis really did not make his case favourable for himself (before you jump on me, please read on to understand where I'm coming from!)

In short, for NS deferment for sportsmen there have been three so far: Maximillian Soh (for sailing), Quah Zheng Wen and Joseph Schooling (for swimming). Maximillian was given a year for deferment, and served NS in 2008 or 2009 (not too sure) after he won several accolades but unfortunately didn't perform as well in 2008. For our swimmers, they already had one round of deferment, which was **further extended** when they applied for it till until the end of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Taking a look at the the typical Mindef replies and discussions, it seems pretty clear that, amongst other (smaller) factors, there are two key considerations for deferment: (1) the potential to excel, and (2) the commitment to an 'end' date for the period of deferment.

# Potential to Excel

Fortunately, or unfortunately, Singapore has always applied a 'business' lens to almost every aspect of its domestic policy, including sports. For example, let's assume that we are in the business of handing out grants and money with the aim of helping aspiring start-up businesses grow and succeed. *From a purely business and economic perspective, no organisation would logically give out money to aspiring start-ups that either have no track record or shown the potential to succeed*. Note the word 'potential' here - if a business showed tremendous potential to excel but for one reason or another didn't, it would be lamentable but still reasonably understandable.

The same would be for sportsmen, in my opinion. For the three who have successfully deferred (and I guess Ben Davis too), it is without a doubt that they have shown tremendous potential to succeed in their various areas. While I agree with one comment I read somewhere on Facebook that, technically, Zheng Wen hasn't really shown the potential to really succeed, I think in overall they have proven that they are well and truly above their peers and perform really well, and are thus qualify for NS deferment in this regard.

But should this be the only factor in deferment? Definitely not.

# Commitment to an 'end' date

Based on what I can find online, Mindef has always been clear that if an athlete is able to fulfil (1), they would readily give deferment if they can fulfil (2) as well, because logically there can't reasonably be an 'unlimited' deferment date (if not, it is really like a blank cheque, and going back to the business angle mentioned earlier, does not make much sense). And so in applications for deferments, athletes would have to provide some sort of **milestone to which their deferment would end, and I guess also the opportunity to re-apply for another deferment after assessing (1) again**. It can be a milestone of time, such as Maximillian, where he assessed that one year more would be enough then to prepare and perform...or it can be a milestone of significant games such as our swimmers, where they committed to an end-goal of the Olympics (in 2016 and 2020). I'm pretty sure that, assuming they both achieve fantastic results again at the 2020 Olympics, and Singapore Swimming assesses that they have the potential to excel again at another games (e.g. 2024 Olympics), Mindef would have no qualms about deferring them till the end of the next games, and then reassessing their case thereafter. 

&#x200B;

Personally, what really puzzles me is why Ben Davis would not follow the footsteps of athletes who have successfully deferred, and given that he already has (1), would not do (2) as well. Why not, for example, commit to a milestone of 2 years for example, or commit to a milestone of SEA Games for the AFC, and thereafter, reapplying if necessary? I recognise and agree with what everyone is saying, that the years he is in are the most important in an athlete for their development pathway...and **I agree wholly**. Why not use that and commit to an end-by date, and then if needed, apply again? **All we know is that his father (who is acting on his behalf), was not willing to commit...why not?** This is nothwithstanding the fact that, based on what I could find, his recent statements seem to contradict what his father said in the past, about how he was always willing to contribute to Singapore (vs how he knew he always wanted to leave at 13), and how he was always willing to compete to bring glory to Singapore (vs how he said he never really felt a sense of belonging in Singapore).

In any case, now that this issue is finally 'resolved' and that he clearly doesn't care much about Singapore anymore, hopefully this is the conclusion of a long drawn out chapter revolving around the topics of NS and sports in Singapore, and hopefully, reignites more discussions on how Singapore can manage the development of the sporting scene, and yet without compromising the need for NS.",,69,0.75

211,Questions regarding BTO & relevant loans,dgucnn,2019-10-12 12:12:14,"I've recently completed clearing my uni tuition loans after graduation since last year and am working with my partner towards a BTO. While planning my finances I've some question I'd like to clarify, especially with people experienced with the BTO process. 

1. To clarify: **For the Staggered Downpayment Scheme, I will be able to pay the downpayment in two halves - once during booking, and once during key collections (around 3 years later)**. I have heard from colleagues that there is an option to pay the entire downpayment only upon key collection, though I doubt that is true.
2. To clarify: **For evaluation of grants / eligibilities, only the base pay will be considered. That is, OT payments, Bonuses and Allowances are not considered.** I have also heard from colleagues that since the evaluation is based on your CPF history, OT and bonuses that contribute to CPF will also be considered, which kind of makes sense.
3. To ask: I will have to check with the bank, but since I won't be able to get a loan up to 75% of the house value (assume 400k), I will need to pay a higher downpayment. Assuming I get a loan of 200k for the 400k house, my first stage of staggered downpayment will cost me 100k (400k - 200k, divided by 2). The website assumes I can get a loan of 75% (i.e. loan = 300k, downpayment = 100k), and therefore states that I will only pay 5% cash during the first stage of payment. However **if my downpayment is 200k (50% instead of 25%), is the cash portion still only 5%, or will it increase according to my downpayment requirements?**
4. To ask: **Is it safe to assume I will be able to fully utilize my CPF to pay off my loan installments, regardless of whether it's a bank loan or a HDB loan? Or do I need to set aside cash every month for payment?**

These are the questions I've thought of today. I'm planning to head down to HDB Hub and my bank to ask about these next Saturday morning (since I work office hours), but somehow I'd like to get a gist of the entire process.

Also if anyone wants me to help clarify some doubts for them next week, do feel free to let me know :)",,10,0.8

258,Growing up sucks,dgd9sy,2019-10-11 10:36:11,"Just another (Long) text post rant, my thoughts will be all over the place but I need a place to vent before I go into a depressive state again. Thanks Reddit Sg especially those who PM’d me last round, but I just want to be heard, but not to be known. 

Growing up as an average kid in Singapore is difficult. I Guess at least I found it difficult. Each time my mum compared me to my two cousins (who were both blessed with wit and creativity), she’d hold a cane to me and scream “Why can’t you study properly?”. I hated it, not because I was offended by what she said, but because I could never reach that standard- Not because I didn’t try, but simply because my mind wouldn’t let me. 

I remember being recommended for an ADHD check up, which my mum vehemently denied me from (which I’m guessing to shelter me from my career implications down the line). I hated being different, but I could never tell why. My mood would swing based on my emotions and they were always strong, I carried a very jovial and happy front, and when hurt I curled up into a ball emotionally. I could never pay attention for longer than a few minutes, but I’m gifted with a great Long term memory to accommodate to my poor short term memory. I vividly remember memories of my childhood, to the extent that I can remember places, things and even questions from then (but I had no control over what was in my long term).

Till today, I still don’t know if I’m suffering from it, or I’m just imagining it, but at this point I’m just too tired to find out.

I owe a lot to my mum, regardless, for sending me to great tutors after school, who had the patience to guide me forward in secondary school - where I managed barely to scrape into Junior college (I wanted to join a poly, but I get into psych). There (TPJC), I met great Teachers, a fantastic Economics tutor (j2) and a meticulous physics tutor (j2). My economics and physics were consistent E’s (although touted to be easy papers). I never thought that Teachers would be so kind and nurturing to the extent that they stayed back Long after their working hours (close to 6/7pm) just to help me (sometimes alone in a 1-1 consult). It helped me so much that I finally felt competent.

I studied my hardest that year, and was pushed on by my grandma, who I had lived with for years into my teenage years - and managed to score a full set of A’s for my A’s. Could you imagine how happy I was? I’m my mind, I was finally on par with my peers, I was no longer struggling. 

My parents were finally satisfied. My grandma was so happy she called me on my phone for the first time with so much joy in her voice. I was happy, and thought I’d never had to worry about incompetence again, I had finally proven myself to my parents that I was worthy of being a person.

In NS, I experienced my greatest loss, my grandma, who had never placed any academic expectations on me, someone, the only one who had faith in me as a person regardless of how well I did in school, left. The week before, she told me to come back for lunch on the weekend, strong and healthy. I never thought that that would be the last time I saw her. The last time I would hear the voice of someone who I knew had faith in me. (I’m in tears as I look back) I can’t express this hole within me right now, back then and I’ll never ever forget her.

Ns was the fastest phase, it passed simply, and I never really had much expectations placed on my shoulders. 

Post NS, my first experience of how adulthood came. I was lucky enough to had been offered an intern opportunity by a kind stranger, and it just happened to align with my degree. I invited one of my pals from NS- who was going for the same degree. 

We both entered the job with high hopes, and we both worked our hardest. I made an honest mistake in letting a quip go to a coworker, that I wasn’t best of friends with that pal, and as she questioned me deeper, I brushed it off, saying that no one truly was best friends with me. I also said that we gelled extremely well with each other when working, and told her we would make great business partners.

Strange things started happening in the coming weeks. My pal gradually became colder and colder to me, and started becoming the best of buddies with said coworker. 

It took me weeks to find out that my coworker had told my pal about the things I’ve said and twisted it into some sort of “I’m only being his friend for the benefit of him when he becomes a partner of the company”. I was frustrated and I confronted him over it immediately. He told me he had never seen such a snake in his life and I was disgusted at how he chose to listen to a gossip rather than clarify it with me. 

We never truly came to an amicable closure, but I swore never to let anyone twist my words again. I went into work with a friend, and left without one. The two buddies I presume still keep in contact, and I Guess good gossip builds true friendship- something that I’ll never bring myself to do. I was so disheartened that he wouldn’t listen to his pal of 2 years vs this coworker he knew for a month.

Then comes uni, which I am currently stuck in. I honestly have not moved on from my last shit post.  Still the same shit, still the same vibes.

I worked with a few friends on a project as the leader, and I left when one of them claimed my title in order to get an internship.

They took my ideas and entered it into another competition, and just like that I lost all my work to them. I heard they got reported for plagiarism, because they immediately pointed their fingers at me. I didn’t do it. And it’s my fault?

In academics, I lag behind so much but I still put on a brave front. I share notes and anything with my friends, but when I ask one particular guy, he answered me “let me think about it”. I wasn’t angry. I was hurt.

I don’t help people with the expectation of getting help back. I help people because I care about them, but it hurts to know that few would do the same for you. 

Growing up means losing innocence. Growing up means people choose others over you, not to your control. Growing up means losing the friends you had, growing up makes you feel so alone. Growing up means losing the people who had faith in you, growing up means you need to have faith in yourself.

264,today is Coming Out Day,dgbp1u,2019-10-11 07:35:13,"Today, 11 October, is Coming Out Day, a day for LGBT awareness.

Frankly, I didn't know anything about it until I saw this mentioned on Oogachaga. Not surprisingly, Coming Out Day started in the US and isn't something that will be observed in Singapore for a long time, if ever at all.

I'm gay and I've known since I was young that I am. I was never attracted to girls, but even in primary school, the pressures of conforming to societal norms was intense. Everyone had to declare they had some crush on a girl, or be seen as abnormal.

The irony is that as a gay, it was always easy for me to get along with girls. There was no hidden agenda since I was never looking to get into their pants. And I had guy friends who were jealous that somehow, girls always seemed more comfortable around me. 

As for my family, they don't suspect a thing. My beloved grandmother had been saving a special dress for the day I get married. My brother openly disses gays in front of me, calling them 'faggots', not realising he is hurting me too. My mom, one time when I tried putting on a earring (purely for fashion, not to make a statement), was almost in tears and asked if it meant I was gay. I told her no and that was that. I can't imagine what her reaction would be if I came out for real.

I am Christian, and it's been tough reconciling my sexuality with my religion. I was caught off guard on one occasion when my pastor dedicated an entire sermon just on the sins of homosexuality. I ran out of church at the end of that session, inconsolable. 

It is painful to read, see and hear of what fundamentalists have to say about gays. It's always easy to blindly condemn when you've never experienced something first-hand, or personally know someone who has. It's even more painful to know of parents who immediately chase their children out the door upon finding out they're gay. To habour such vile and blind hatred upon an offspring of your love, is to me, inexplicable. 

I know what is written in the scriptures. But I also know how I feel.

I didn't ask to be gay. It wasn't up to me. It's not something I can change. 

Being gay is not a 'lifestyle'. It's not like clothes that can be chosen and bought at a store. It makes me the target of discrimination, ridicule, bullying, hate and even violence. You couldn't sell something like that to me, no matter how great any potential 'upsides' to being gay there might be.

So today, on Coming Out Day in Singapore, I remain truly and firmly closeted. 

For a country that prides itself on doing the right thing, I'm disappointed that a law that puts the crosshairs on gays remains a law to this day. While symbolic, it also provides the license for haters to hate.

To my gay elders who've walked the tough road and paved the way for today's generation to come out easier, thank you.

To the younger ones who're still discovering themselves, everybody deserves to be loved.

And to fellow Singaporeans in a society increasingly divided, I hope you choose to love, above all else.",,1625,0.9

>You’re being a sophist, because it’s pretty evident that Halimah identifies as Malay and has lived her life as a Melayu woman. Whether her father does or doesn’t identify as Malay is a moot point, because we’re talking about her, not her daddy. My point still stands, and you haven’t considered the angle of her father being assimilated into and identifying with Malay Muslim culture (which in all likeliness is the case) even if his IC says something else.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddnqqi/the\_fall\_from\_prominence\_singapores\_arab\_community/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddnqqi/the_fall_from_prominence_singapores_arab_community/)

I came across this comment and thought it might worth a wider conversation / discussion. 

It dawned on me a similar argument where a while American woman **Rachel Anne Dolezal** identified herself as black and for years adopted the culture and framed an body appareance. The Blacks incidentally are not too happy as they have a term **""Blackfishing ""** for it**.**  

The argument that ""Whether her father does or doesn’t identify as Malay is a moot point, because we’re talking about her, not her daddy."" seems illogical. Choosing to abandon one's race and culture is one thing but claiming to be member of another is quite another.  

I would have thought that a better argument is that she was raised mainly by her mother whose is a Malay with all trappings of the Malay culture rather than claim of allowing someone to have a choice of identifying oneself with another race.",,0,0.48

The company is confused to why they rejected my pass, since MoM won't state a reason why. Has any foreigners here experienced the same thing? And I'm even more confused since it states on the SAT that I am indeed eligible for an S-Pass. 

Can anyone please help direct me to what I can or should do next? I'm telling everyone I'm okay but honestly I can feel myself breaking down inside. I have a clear plan to work in Singapore for a few years and hv a future here with my SO of 5 years, and now everything seem to crumble up and I'm terrified to move on and just confused.

277,"After reading TNP's review of Joker, I can no longer ignore the fact that our local media's film critics are either restrained or inadequate.",dg87ju,2019-10-11 01:51:24,"*""Joker's main issue is that it wants to have its custard pie and eat it too. Phillips appears desperate for Joker not to be a comic book film and yet it keeps needlessly dropping Batman references.""*

*"" The really annoying thing is that at the end of the day, this is a film about a man's breakdown albeit with some DC Comics properties slapped on it. ""*

I mean, really? Sure, the film could have done without it and still function equally well, but that's what they are saying to substantiate a 2.5/5 rating, because they threw in some easter eggs and some fan service?

Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but really appalled that this is a professional paid to write this.  It could be some censorship involved that restricts them to state some overly socio-political/ left wing/ opinions, or they simply think their audience is not sophisticated enough to appreciate a movie like this.  


Edit: people seem to think im hating on a critic because he doesnt share my sentiments on a film, even though i already said he's entitled to his opinions. i am not. I mean his superficial comments of how it's trying to be a non-comic book-y serious drama, while pandering to fans with references, is his main gripe, is extremely surface level for a piece that he's admitting is hard to ignore or has made an impact.  I love to hear constructive counter arguments, which I think is his role as a journalist and an obligation as a film critic.",,83,0.77

307,Limpeh hoping to leave it all behind and start a new life in Singapore,dftgfg,2019-10-10 05:32:59,"Hello all Singaporeans, looking for advice.

Here's my situation: I am a Singaporean who spent more than a decade in the US. I did my NS more than 5 years ago and I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree. I've been working as an engineer in the US for nearly a year and have been living a very comfortable life, but I'm tired of being in the US.

When I was in Singapore, I was surrounded by family. Here, I just feel so lonely sometimes. No girl wants to touch me here and while I don't feel discriminated against, I feel left out a lot as a minority and disrespected (it's uncommon for Asians to be promoted to management). As a side note, I tried tinder in the US and then in Singapore. I had maybe 5 matches a day in Singapore but in the US I had maybe 3 a week (guess which girls ghosted me and which didn't). But this is more than just my love life; I also want to feel comfortable and I feel most comfortable among my people.

Yet, I have reservations about moving back, which is mainly my career. I feel like I've chosen the wrong major as I think a Mechanical Engineering degree is hard for transitioning back to Singapore. I know that there is Mechanical Engineering jobs in Singapore but I've heard that in general they are underpaid, overworked and underappreciated. I honestly wouldn't mind taking a pay cut to feel a sense of belonging again, but I do want to be on a career trajectory that leads to a respected and well paid profession. (Engineers are paid very well in the US, which is the only reason why I'm sticking around).

What can I do in Singapore career-wise? Can I transition to a different sector such as say, finance or business analytics? Would any of you recommend staying in the mechanical engineering industry in Singapore? What can I even do with a mechanical engineering degree? How do companies view it?

Even if you can't answer the questions, the more information I know about working in Singapore the less blind I feel. Even tangential stories about engineers in Singapore would help a lot, or even career paths. Thank you everyone for your time.",,70,0.83
308,Aggregated Driving Tips from r/sg,dft04x,2019-10-10 04:46:20,"In a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/d8jpdn/drivers_in_sg_what_are_the_starter_pack_driving/) I asked about some starter driving laws and tips. Here I have compiled a list so that all can refer.

### Parking
- Do not park at Zig zag yellow lines, double yellow lines, near fire hydrants or against traffic in small roads 
- Do not park on either side of the road when there is a single or double white line in the middle.
- Do not park at single yellow lines between 7am to 7pm except Sundays and PH.
- If parking at HDB look out for the red sign at the bottom of the parking sign board that states if it's only reserved for season parking after 1030pm if you're visiting friends late at night.

### On The Road
- Always keep left unless overtaking and always signal your intention.
- Remember your cashcard or just sign up for vCashcard. Always signal your intention.
- Bus lanes: Normal (Mon to Fri 7.30am to 9.30am; 5pm to 8pm), Full-day (7.30am to 11pm everyday except Sunday and PH). Always signal your intention.
- Take note of mandatory giving way to buses. Recognize the marking especially near bus stops. Always signal your intention.
- Lamp posts with yellow markings are monitored by LTA cams. Always signal your intention.
- Beating red light right turns is as good as beating the red light. Clear traffic on opposite end doesn't mean go if the light is red. Always signal your intention.
- When in the rightmost lane to turn right, turn into the corresponding rightmost lane. Oh and always signal your intention.

### Good Advice
- During discretionary green man turns check for cars and check your mirror for motorbikes trying to squeeze through your sides, physically turn your head to check left and right for pedestrians.
- There is no buffer for speed limits. 90 is 90.
- Right lane is for overtaking, especially on expressways. If you are not going fast enough, move out of that lane.
- Aggressively overtaking and cutting lanes will only save you seconds. It isn’t worth it and you just make it worse for others. Start your day right and just keep in your lane and follow the order.
- Smile and tell yourself why be angry. Everyone is also human. He could be your father or brother. She could be your mother or sister. Humanise other road users and suddenly a PMD user, cyclist, taxi driver or whoever seems more bearable and you just learn to live to let live.
(thanks to u/BumSophistication for this whole section) 

Hope this helps people. Drive safe and remember always signal your intention.",,101,0.95

By the end of the month I'll relocate to Singapore. Most things are already organised but I have some open questions regarding some smaller things where I could need your help:

&#x200B;

1. Bankaccount: Which bank do you recommend? I'll apply for CSR or Citi prestige cc anyway so I won't need the bank account often to payments often (whenever possible I pay with credit card) but for stuff like rent and salary I need a trustful local bank in Singapore. (No need for credit card services etc from the local bank)
2. Mobile: I'll travel quite a lot internationally (mostly ASIA but sometimes US/CAN and Europe). Where I live now (Switzerland) there are quite some big differences between the ISPs some are clearly better (coverage) than others. Any recommendations for mobile phone contract companies? 
3. ISP: Similar than 2.) Which ISP for local internet connection at home can you recommend (best case 2) and 3) are the same ISP

Thanks a lot for helping out.",,0,0.36

Words are bandied about publicly as accusations - ""left-wing"", ""socialist"", ""English-educated"".

Elsewhere, Chinese students riot in the streets. The government draws links between these two separate incidents.

The poet is arrested along with his associates and put on trial.

The university defends him and even pays his bail.

(One of his seniors will later make the case that their trial was accidental - the offensive material was actually ghostwritten by the seniors but they had to take exams so they let the juniors do it.)

He is defended by a young lawyer who subscribes to their work, who brings in a foreigner to help defend him - both work pro bono.

The young lawyer helps the poet and his friends crowdsource for funds. Foreign politicians, including the soon-to-be PM of Malaysia, send in money to contribute to the defence.

A young newspaper journalist writes several articles supporting the poet and his friends. He defiantly titles his column ""I write as I please"". He is called in for questioning by the government.

The defense is successful and the poet and friends are acquitted.

The young lawyer becomes incredibly popular as a result of this, leading directly to him forming a political party in the same year, with the young journalist and several of the poet's friends.

The poet is Edwin Thumboo.

The senior is SR Nathan.

The journalist is S Rajaratnam.

The lawyer is Lee Kuan Yew.""

> 2. For protesting in front of Parliament House against the govt's lack of action on climate change - she would be arrested, because even a one-person public protest here is regarded as an illegal assembly, and her protest sign would be seized by the police.

> 3. Govt-controlled mainstream media will do a hack job on her, painting her as some sort of destabilising agent, with insinuations that she is paid by foreigners.

> 4. Pro-govt trolls will attack her viciously online - accusing her of being ungrateful and ignorant (see, PM Lee already said $100b will be spent on fighting climate change in S'pore!), that she is being paid by foreigners, or at least is a willing pawn of foreign agents who want to destabilise Singapore, that she should have made use of Speaker's Corner instead of striking in front of Parliament as a stunt.

> 5. Ex-MPs from the ruling party will write to the govt-controlled media/press to slam her, accusing her of wanting to bring ""western-style democracy"" to Singapore.

> 6. Ministers will make speeches about foreign interference, citing her as a negative example, questioning who is funding her.

> 7. She will be charged in court for her protest, or she will be issued a ""stern warning"" by the authorities.

> 8. Greta will, under such intense pressure, then issue a public apology, and pledge never to walk outside the straight and narrow again.

> 9. And then all will be silent, and peaceful in Singapore.

439,Wildlife in Singapore; Part 48: Mangrove Whistler,dem421,2019-10-07 16:49:16,"Hi r/singapore, this week I'll be talking about another species of bird that is the sole representative of its family in Singapore, the [Mangrove Whistler](https://singaporebirds.com/species/mangrove-whistler/).

Like the Golden-bellied Gerygone (which I talked about [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/db5bl7/wildlife_in_singapore_part_47_goldenbellied/)), the Mangrove Whistler is an insectivore that forages in the treetops. It's a small, plain-looking brown bird [with a distinctive song](https://www.xeno-canto.org/447967). However, while the Golden-bellied Gerygone is a common, widespread species that has readily adapted to urban areas, the Mangrove Whistler is much rarer, and has a very restricted distribution. It usually lives in mangroves and other coastal vegetation, although it is sometimes found inland, in wooded areas and abandoned rubber plantations.

For some time, [the only publicly accessible location](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/10-rare-resident-bird-species-in-singapore-and-where-to-best-find-them/) in Singapore where birdwatchers could reliably [find the Mangrove Whistler](https://flic.kr/p/9kVyLJ) was [Pulau Hantu](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/nss-blue-and-green-survey-22-feb-2018/). Given the tiny size of Pulau Hantu, the population of Mangrove Whistlers [living there](https://fryap.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/grey-thickheads-at-ghost-island/amp/) is very small. Pulau Tekong is apparently a stronghold for this species, but needless to say, visiting that island is out of the question for most birdwatchers. It has also been found on occasion [on Pulau Semakau](https://flic.kr/p/bpGwPU), with the most recent record taking place during a bird survey [in August 2018](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2018/09/23/singapore-bird-report-august-2018/).

In the Southern Islands, besides Pulau Hantu and Pulau Semakau, in the 1980s, the species was known from Pulau Ayer Merbau (one of the smaller islands that now makes up Jurong Island), as well as Pulau Pawai, Pulau Senang, and Pulau Sudong (the three islands that the SAF uses as a military training area and live-firing zone). Just like with Pulau Tekong, visiting these islands today to verify the continued survival of the Mangrove Whistler is extremely difficult, if not next to impossible, for members of the public.

In the north, besides Pulau Tekong, the Mangrove Whistler is known to occur on Pulau Ubin, with more sightings taking place [in recent years](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/singapore-bird-report-september-2017/).

The Mangrove Whistler has vanished from various sites in mainland Singapore where it was historically present, such as Jurong Lake, Khatib Bongsu, Kranji, Loyang, and Simpang. Sadly, even populations in apparently protected areas aren't necessarily secure; the last sighting of this species in Sungei Buloh was in September 2001. Although there have been several sightings in some locations the last decade, records remain scattered and sporadic. In the east, it was recorded from the reclaimed land at Changi East [in January 2015](https://www.nss.org.sg/report/ac1fd3a6-2Singapore%20Bird%20Report%20-%20Jan%202015.pdf)), [Tampines Eco Green in July 2015](https://besgroup.org/2015/08/07/mangrove-whistler-spotted-at-tampines-eco-green/), and [Pasir Ris Park in July 2016](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/singapore-bird-report-july-2016/). In the south, a lone bird was seen at Marina East in [July 2017](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/singapore-bird-report-july-2017/). Most recently, a Mangrove Whistler [showed up for several days](https://flic.kr/p/2h5rpwu) at [Jurong Eco Garden](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/177185201) in [August this year](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/singapore-bird-report-august-2019/).

Just like the Golden-bellied Gerygone, the Mangrove Whistler is the only representative of its family that lives in mainland Southeast Asia; the family it belongs to, the Pachycephalidae, mostly comprise species that live east of the [Wallace Line](https://www.asiangeo.com/heritage/wallace-line-kangaroo-meets-monkey/), in Australia, New Guinea, and various island groups of the South Pacific, as well as Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands and Maluku Islands of Indonesia. Only three members of this family can be found west of the Wallace Line, with the Mangrove Whistler having the widest range, stretching from the coasts of northeastern India and Bangladesh to the Andaman Islands, Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina (where it is also found inland in the Tonlé Sap region of Cambodia), Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali, and Lombok, as well as Palawan in the Philippines.

They're accompanied by cop cars and bikes, and seem to take up the entire road. Once they leave, regular traffic begins and you could see the dense lines of vehicles that resulted from them taking the entire road. I don't think it's Chingay, Chingay wasn't this obnoxious.

So I would like to get some insights from local Singaporeans here.

485,Is it normal for police to guilt trip people to come to the police station for interviews?,dedicv,2019-10-07 02:46:03,"I am posting here because r/asksingapore is very inactive.

I recently reported an e-crime to the police. I had 2 phone conversations with 2 separate policemen who followed up with me about the case on the same day of the reporting (5 days ago). I am very appreciative of the first 2 police officers as they were very understanding about my case and their prompt response was excellent.

Just today I received another call from a third different police officer, asking about the case, and if I could come down to be interview regarding the case. However I currently live in school, a long way from the police station, and I am currently having exams. Moreover, I have classes to attend every day from 9 to 8 and the breaks in between classes are insufficient time to go down if not I will miss class.

I told the police officer, but rather than working to arrange a common timing this weekend, she still insisted on me coming down on the weekdays, saying things like,

""you were having exams but you still chose to make the police report around this time..?"", ""you know I would like to follow up with this case ASAP..."",""I mean you can come out of school to the police station right..? It will only take an hour.."" (no, it will take 3+ hours considering the travel time from school to the police station).""I mean the police want to work on this case but we need more information...""(but all the information and evidence, I had already fully given to the police????)

Moreover, she kept asking me basic details about the case that I had already mentioned in my report, and to the other 2 police officers. She also asked me very difficult questions like, ""how do you think this is a crime?"" and ""what do you think the police officers can do?"" I know for a FACT that what had happened was definitely a crime, but I was unsure of what to do hence I went to the police officers in the first place to ask about it??? What kind of question is this?

I am beginning to question if the person that called me was even a police officer in the first place... are all these things normal for a police officer to say to a citizen..? Apologies as this is my first time reporting something to the police and I am unsure of all these procedures.

Edit: I tried to offer to come down today in exchange for some letter to show my teachers that I was away for something urgent, she said she could not do it. I tried to offer a fixed timing on the weekend or on friday after my exams for me to come down to the station, she also declined.

Tried to find aspirin...this is a commonly available, low cost painkiller...watsons doesnt appear to have it and guardian only has a box of 30 tablets for $10. WTF.

I dont know whats going on, whats with these prices? Why are common OTC meds so hard to get here? I mean, look at Australia, you can get a box of 96 aspirin tablets for $4 and their average wage is like, twice that of SG?

I would like to avoid climate, immigration, ban PMDs, pinkdot vs WAAPD, POFMA, NS, discussed-everywhere-else issues please. I'm keen to hear new and interesting stuff! 

Here's some of my random stuff to kick things off:

\- Shoving flyers onto car windscreens should be treated the same as littering. Makes no sense to me that if a person leaves a flyer in a carpark lot it's littering, and just because my car happens to be between the flyer and the lot and suddenly it's legal? I've driven off with a flyer flapping on my windscreen more times than I care to confess :D

\- Molesters go to jail. Straight up. 

\- Abolish PSLE or get rid of the through-train program. I think it was a BIG mistake getting rid of PSLE and putting even more pressure on 12 year olds. Either delay that ONE BIG IMPORTANT EXAM so that kids are more mature when they take it on, or put in more exam levels for people to have multiple chances to get into the stream of their choosing and one's education destiny doesn't fall down to a single exam.

\- Reward drivers for courteous driving, at least temporarily until courtesy is ingrained. A lot of us aren't polite drivers (well, still better than some other places I've been to), but as another post has discussed, there's just no reward for being nice. Put that reward in place. Instead of asking driver to post videos of shitty drivers, have them post videos of courteous drivers. Courteous driver AND the poster both get a small reward (haven't thought hard enough about what that reward should be yet)

\- Why is our individual tax rate higher than corporate tax rate? The richest in Singapore probably earn more through dividends than through salary so their resultant tax on a company owner would be lower percent than their highly paid employee. Raising corporate income tax does have knock-on effects on businesses. Instead it might be worth considering a small dividend tax to equalise against individual income tax.

507,AMA SG Climate Rally,de0oa0,2019-10-06 08:44:22,"Hello r/Singapore!

We are the organisers of SG Climate Rally, Singapore's first physical climate action event. On the 21st of September, we held a rally at Hong Lim Park that attracted over two thousand Singaporean Citizens and PRs, who stood together in solidarity to support stronger government action in addressing climate change.

We are an independent group of about 20 concerned individuals - university students, climate researchers, academics, scientists, lawyers and programmers. Relying on collective action and capacity building, we call on the government to take bold systemic action to mitigate the climate crisis.

We will be online between 5-8 PM today, so ask us anything!

Our list of Calls To Action for the government can be accessed here: [tinyurl.com/SGCRCTA](https://tinyurl.com/SGCRCTA)

534,An idea to help charities raise money and create jobs for poor elderly and handicapped.,ddn2ta,2019-10-05 13:11:35,"Its simple. Hire the unemployed old/handicapped people to raise funds for charities using ezlink card/cashless methods. (Government regulated)

&#x200B;

Why unemployed/handicapped?

This is the one job that they definitely do better than young, healthy people. They can evoke more sympathy from the people and raise much more money. Its like the beggers at the mrt station but this time, they are not beggers, but dignified employed fundraisers helping to make the world a better place.

&#x200B;

Why ezlink/cashless method?

Its easy. Just beep and go. They will also raise more money because the doners know the money goes directly into the charity accounts. At the end of the month, the charities will pay the employed fund raisers a portion of the funds they raised as commissions.

&#x200B;

Why government regulated?

Prevents frauds. The police can make their patrols and check the registeration numbers of the ezlink device 

&#x200B;

EXAMPLE: Imagine an old lady with a shelter dog raising funds for an animal shelter outside an mrt station. Doners can just tap $1 and go. The dog would love it. The old lady gets paid and the passerby will feel good helping others.  

&#x200B;

Win win situation for everyone

&#x200B;

Government = create more jobs for old/handicapped ppl, help reduce the number of fake beggers on the street. 

&#x200B;

Old/handicapped ppl= gives them dignity, wages, empower them to help others. This is a job they can definitely do better than young, healthy people.

&#x200B;

Doners= makes them feel good about giving and also let them know that their money is definitely going to good use

&#x200B;

Charities= A huge source of income for charities. This will raise more fund as it will be far more acceptable to the people than hiring young, healthy people to raise money. 

&#x200B;

How to implement this?

Election is coming, MPs are going to make their rounds, they will ask for suggestions from the people. If you like this idea, tell them this suggestion. You can print it out and pass it to them.

&#x200B;

(Anyway, I am sure my idea can be improve, I welcome all criticisms.)

569,Punishment vs Rehabilitation,ddcmuo,2019-10-04 20:01:34,"I think there has been a lot of discussions on the recent cases involving university students who are guilty of sexual offences. It seems to me on this sub that most people are of the view that said offenders should have received harsher punishments and not be allowed mitigations based on their academic performances and other related factors.

It also appears that while most people here are supportive of more punitive responses to such crimes, almost none of us are concerned with the rehabilitation of such perpetrators or with the detrimental effects more punitive measures could have on their rehabilitation. It’s as if we have decided collectively as a society that these people are lepers that should be casted out and left to fend for themselves. It’s as if we have decided that these people are not worthy of any redemption. Basically, all we are saying is “let’s lock them up” without actually caring about “what do we do about them next”. 

I can’t help but feel that the systematic way we treat and outcast people who commit such crimes is the reason why we have a culture where sexual crimes and misconduct are so perpetuated and normalised. In another thread, we see how there are telegram channels with thousand of members dedicated to voyeuristic contents, many of which involve children and teenagers. This is a worrying trend and I personally feel that this is a result of us avoiding the elephant in the room. Discussions about sex are usually considered taboo here in our culture and especially so for certain sexual compulsions. We fear discussing issues like these so much, we have no choice but to compartmentalise it as something completely abhorrent. The only reasonable response to that for us would be to chuck them into a small corner away from our lives(both figuratively and literally), and avoid having to deal with them again. 

However, being outcasted with nowhere to go, people with sexual compulsions and tendencies have to resort to forming their own in-groups as a show of solidarity and to feel “normal” again. This might be a very warped sense of belonging but it is the only way for them to feel like a functional member of society amidst their dysfunction. 

I may be in a minority here, but I feel that whatever the case ruling, the judge had the best intention. There is always a fine line in balancing punishment and rehabilitation, and it being a zero sum game sometimes, giving more of rehabilitation means giving out less of the other. Too often, we fail to realise that perhaps such crimes are manifestations of underlying behavioural problems and that these people are more in need of help than of punishments.

Just to play the devil’s advocate, I’m actually wondering if in the case of sexual misconduct, would more jail time or caning(punitive) be a more effective response against let’s say, probation/counselling (rehabilitative) for the perpetrators. Because let’s face it, when we give them more jail time and harsher sentences, the less likely they are able to seek actual outside help on their compulsions. If we do not treat other addictions by just locking them up only and pretending that they no longer exist, why should we do the same for addictions of a sexual nature?

TLDR: We fear what we don’t understand, and we don’t understand what we don’t talk about. We don’t talk openly enough about sexual crimes and compulsions/addictions, and this is the reason why we are seeing worrying trends today. Faced with such symptoms, would punishment or rehabilitation(or a little of both) be the more appropriate response to such crimes?",,59,0.74

575,Why do people own a Car in Singapore when it is really expensive,dd93r4,2019-10-04 15:44:00,"Hi everyone,

I am a foreigner who came to Singapore to study for my Masters. I am originally from India. 

My question for everyone over here is why do Singaporeans own a car when it is so prohibitively expensive. Over a period of 10 years it costs 160k(Basing it on the numbers given in the link below). The public transport is really good, on time, comfortable, etc. So I can't fathom why would anyone want to buy a car. The option of taking a taxi is still there when you can't take public transport from time to time.  Even if a person takes a taxi almost daily, it would still not reach the amount you pay for the car over a period of 10 years. I have not even included the cost of renewing the COE after 10 years. Then the added cost of getting a driving license.

I understand one of the reasons can be prestige, to show off that you can afford to buy a car. Such people will always be there, but is everyone like that ? Why buy it when these days you can book a taxi at the push of a button. 

Can anyone share the other legitimate reasons why people buy cars ?

578,[serious] family issues,dd6vp3,2019-10-04 12:46:16,"My family has been arguing for about a year now. The crux of the issue is that my dad is useless and egoistic and insists on running his (dead) business, while my mum is trying to hold our head above the water. My dad has also borrowed money from my relatives numerous times, and has also borrowed money from me. Recently, he decided, for some god knows reason, to purchase a new 8 seater car, and now has trouble paying it off. I was asked by my mum to help pay 2.3k recently. That's my entire NSF pay so far. This money issue, has of course lead to quarrels and basically a dysfunctional family. But it gets better.  


My grandma \*needs\* a domestic helper, it would literally be impossible for her to live day-to-day otherwise. But the contract is almost up, and there's been arguments about whether to continue the contract. My mum claims that she has had to pay everything, which is somewhat true, but my grandma claims that the other relatives can help pay - which is somewhat true. To summarize this argument,   


1. relatives don't want her to stay with them because troublesome 
2. a lot of my richer relatives (i have an uncle who's supposedly a board member of Singtel) do not help with the costs at all 
3. my family needs help financially
4. my dad has asked numerous times from family members to help pay off his loans from loan sharks, angering them 
5. my dad has too high of an ego to sell off his red-zone company and get a real job 
6. my dad also has too high of an ego to ask for help, and when he does he keeps evading the issue and pressuring relatives to lend him money. 

I'm fucking tired. I don't care about this family. If there was a choice where I could sever all ties with them and live on my own while maintaining at least some degree of financial dignity, I would. My depression bouts have become more severe and prolonged as a result of constant family issues. But tough luck - I'm in the army.

But that isn't the only issue, if you're trying to be nice, helpful, friendly or just a better person, the society here just tells you 'hold my beer, imma ruin this person with good intentions'

You can say, 'oh ! Every place got dick heads and cunts, don't get too worked up, I'm sure there are nice people who appreciate your efforts all around'

See, I don't disagree with the statement. But it's the concentration of ungrateful people or assholes around here that is so promenient that sometimes you think where the people who appreciate someone with good intentions are.

Let's take the example of drivers here for example. Everyone is always in a rush to get home or somewhere, and if you're a nice driver and always give way, you're going to be tested because people are just going to take advantage of the situation, and not give a wave to say thank you. Hell, or even cut in at such a speed where its unsafe for themselves or even you. 

It's going to drain out a good person when he or she who is extremely caring, generous or nice just keep helping people, and it keeps happening that everytime the people that they help turns on them or just becomes a asshole right after. It's going to seriously make them consider if they even feel being nice is even worth the effort.

I've seen good people who just get really exhausted because of the environment, the people they have to deal with etc.

Take the example of the other thread about helping beggars. And given how often people get MLMs trying to make a quick buck out of people who are kind enough to give them their time, only to find out its a MLM makes it very quick for pedestrian to find anyone coming up to you on the street as doing something for their own 'benefit'.

The purpose of this thread isn't to condemn or condone the judge's decisions, but I hope we could bridge the understanding and thoughts between low-class people like me and IBs.

Here's what I think:

- We were indoctrinated to meritocracy and the judges went through the painful path to achieve academic excellence to reach where they are today
- Those who excel academically could contribute greatly to Singapore in the long-term compared to jailing them
- I also want to make it clear: I'm fully aware that this is a standard practice in other countries too. There have been outcry about this issue in other countries too

Nevertheless, I disagree because

- It's unfair to sentence educated people to far lower sentence when Singapore has a reputation for being tough on law enforcement. This kind of system breeds the mistrust among the people and the judiciary, and no matter what new Contempt of Court legislations passed won't be able to help it
- Those who commit these crimes though they can still be useful in the society, they are just a minority. Missing these few perverts will not dent the Singapore's economy
- There are many lower SES/less educated people who could've been hit far worse than these educated scholars by a jail term, who already have less potential in life could paralyse their future more deserve the magnanimity than these educated scholars—even their worst outcome is still better than many.
- That being said, I really don't know if Singapore benefits more or the perpetrator himself/herself benefits more from this scheme. I don't think Singapore's economy will dent while I think this system is enriching the perpetrators to help them stay/get to high SES life just because they are scholars",,44,0.81

What would the other party have to do in order for you to change your vote? So if you are a staunch PAP supported, what would the opposition need to do to get you to vote opposition, and conversely, if you are a die hard WP voter, what could the PAP do to earn your vote?

(Please try to avoid ""nothing, the PAP/WP is perfectly horrible and I will never vote for them"", this is mean to be fun). 

Also, this discussion is just for fun and you should remember that it is not a good thing to be a single issue voter, and when the election does come around please assess the parties holistically and not merely based on their view of your pet topic. 

To kick things off, I've always voted for opposition but if the PAP did one of the following things I would actually vote for them (assuming that the opposition does not promise the same):

1) Repeal 377A, and set a road map on how to eventual reach marriage equality. This is pretty self explanatory. 

2) Set out a comprehensive climate change plan. This should cover both mitigation and preventive measures, and would set out benchmark goals for each phase of our climate change strategy - for example in phase one gathering information via studies to be conducted on the effects of various things like single use plastics (and their alternatives), air-conditioning/central air-conditioning, car ownership, electric vehicles, and in phase two implementing policies based on the information done in phase one.

We were on our way to a hospital for an appointment (I was accompanying them). I won't say which hospital for identifying reasons. A couple metres away from the entrance was an elderly man in a wheelchair, who started rolling up the sloped pavement to the traffic light nearby. As he was going up the incline, he started slipping, and called out for help. Since we were the closest people nearby, we hurried to stabilize him. 

As soon as we had a hold of his wheelchair, and as soon as we began pushing him, while still on the incline, he immediately turned around and began asking us directly for money. He started saying things like he hasn't eaten for three days. The government won't help him. Please don't be so heartless. Please spare me some change. Please, I haven't eaten for three days, I'm so hungry, etc

My partner and I were like awkwardseal.jpg ""oh shit it's this kind of person"" and trying to avoid the question, tried to ask him instead if he needed to continue crossing the road, since he had asked us to push him to the traffic light. He in turn also ignored our questions and kept on asking for money. 

While this was going on, a bunch of people were walking by us (since, near a hospital). A middle aged man had been standing off to the side and observing this. When it was clear the guy wasn't looking to cross the street despite asking for help to do so, he started talking loudly at us. ""Hey. I've seen you (the handicapped person) around. I know what you're doing. You did this two times yesterday already."" And then separately to us, who were still awkwardsealing with the wheelchair on the upward slope, and couldn't let go (because the dude would probably roll back and crash) or move (because oh no leaving midway after he already directly confronted us is rude what do), he said, ""Don't help him. He does this all the time. It's not the first time already."" We kind of nodded helplessly and he went on his way.

When we asked again if he (wheelchair) needed to cross the street, this time he went, ""No! My boxes are still here."" He then pointed to a pile of dirty and soggy cardboard boxes piled next to a pillar behind him roughly where he first started out. Then he looked us in the eye and went, ""Look, if you cannot help me, don't waste my time huh?"" 

jackiechanwtf.jpg

Ended up wheeling him back to the spot he pointed out, told him apologetically we had to leave, and left. 

On one hand, I'm really sorry his situation sucks that he had to resort to means like that. On the other hand, ""don't waste my time""?? You were the one who called us over! And he knew damn well what he was pretending to cross the street, rolling back, all that. I'm sorry man but I felt less inclined to help after he pulled this stunt. 

It's like the first aid thing where you point at a particular person and ask them for help directly because then the person will feel obliged to help instead of the bystander effect.

I cooled down after we made our way in and registered for my partner's appointment and was thinking about going to buy some food and drink and going back to give it to the guy (at least it wouldn't be pure money). But my partner said not to since it would reaffirm his manipulation tactics.

Edit: don't really have a point to this, just needed to vent. Am I just super naive or is this type of thing common nowadays?

Edit2: Left the hospital an hour later and someone else had been conned into wheeling him uphill. Still in the same spot.",,148,0.95

The show timings indicated that the movie would start at 21:20. The movie actually began at 21:47. That’s 27 minutes of being bombarded with ads that frankly I had no interest in seeing and that I didn’t pay to sit there and watch. 

My friend and I paid money to go and watch a 122minute runtime movie, and got some drinks to go along with it, we did not pay to watch almost half-an-hour’s worth of ads. 

Am I the only one who feels cheated of my time here? Whenever I make a booking, I certainly don’t think, “oh hell yeah, I’m gonna totally enjoy watching this dank movie, along with the 20+ mins of ads that golden village theatres will show me. I can’t wait to see the Visa ads, they are my favourite!” 

Maybe there’s something in the terms and conditions that I missed. I’m gonna go home and go through them(cause I’ve got nothing better to do.) I just wanted to know what my fellow Singaporeans think...

She kept turning her head abit to see who's following her and all to the point where it got quite obvious to me, so I took out my phone and used it as it was getting awkward.

After sometime, she stopped to the side and used her phone. I'm pretty sure she was feeling scared so I just walk pass her without looking at her and walked to my block lift which was really close at this point of time. 

Pressed the button to call the lift and while waiting, i realise that she walked towards the lift as well so it was obvious she stays there. 

Lift came, i entered the lift and pressed my floor but she didn't press anything. I knew that she wasn't one of my neighbors, so she's still probably being cautious of me. 

Lift reached my floor so I waited for a milisecond for her to leave the lift as she was standing closer to the exit but she didn't move. So I just walked out without looking back.

I know that she felt cautious of me since we've been walking the same path but man, that hurts like hell.

654,//RANT STORY// Entitled auntie on MRT,dcn4c5,2019-10-03 06:39:21,"To start off the story, I live in the east part of SG and I travel to the north for work. The journey takes about 1.5hrs, so sometimes if I’m running late, I will just leave home first then do my makeup on the train ride instead cos I don’t want to screw up all the transfers timing. So that particular day, I was running late so I planned to do my makeup on the train ride. I boarded and after the train cleared a bit, there was finally one seat but it was the dreaded ‘reserved seat’. I mean honestly if I can choose, which self-respecting millennial would choose to sit there and suffer the constant panic attacks that someone is secretly filming them not giving up their seats to the elderly? But sadly that day, I was that self-disrespecting millennial which think ‘aiya just sit and faster get my things done’ as I don’t want to turn up for work looking like zombie from The Walking Dead. So I sat down, took out my makeup and was just about to start dabbing it on my face, when the train door slide open at the next station and my nemesis to be rushed in and started to look around the train for a seat anxiously. She looks late 50-ish, with a pixie-cut short hair dyed in reddish orangey colour, and was dragging along her wet-market exclusive canvas trolley bag which have spring onions poking out of it. 

My detailed observation of her was my downfall, as it compelled me to look at her face and that led to us having eye contact. It was that moment when she realised that I was the youngest amongst others sitting on the reserved seat (the train was not packed but there were no available seats and she have a good view of everyone sitting down. There were late 20s/ early 30s ppl sitting on other reserved seats too). Once she had the eye contact, she dashed right in front of me and said: “Can you give up your seat to me? (ni ke yi rang wei gei wo ma?)” 

All these happened within seconds, I stoned and stared at her and then look down at makeup laid out on my thighs. My first few thoughts were ‘wah can’t you see I busy?’, ‘this auntie high level one, know how to ask for seat type’ and ‘wah siao liao sibei suay, need to do makeup whilst standing liao’. After my groggy brain went over all these thoughts, I started thinking like okay how should I pack up. I stoned for 5 secs looking at my makeup before starting to put things away. I think my pause to think was quite obvious cause within a split-second after my movement, the lady beside me (late 20s – early 30s ; she look older than me) stood up and say: “Nvm auntie, you sit here, I’m getting off on the next stop”. I admit that I was relieved like ‘heng ah, she da real mvp.’ But this comes the annoying part, the auntie had the audacity to say to the lady: “aiyo nvm nvm, young people must let them stand one. (aiyo bu yao jin bu yao jin, nian qing ren jiu shi yao zhan de)”. 

I WAS INSTANTLY TRIGGERED BY HER COMMENT. Normally, I would just ignore all these annoying passing comments as I’m just too lazy to argue or make a scene. But on that day bcos I have so much angst thoughts on my mind that words came out before I even realised. I turned and look her in her eyes and said ”why young people must stand? (wei she me nian qing ren jiu shi yao zhan?)” And then I saw the glint in her eyes which says ‘wah this girl dare to rebut and challenge me ah, ooookay challenge accepted, let me educate you this disrespectful millennial’ and then she started to speak in a louder voice, her eyes darting around, looking if anyone was looking at us. “You don’t know this seat is for old people one ah? Only old people, injured people and people who have small baby can sit!! (too lazy to translate in pinyin lol)” She said loudly, whilst poking and tapping against the reserved seat sticker above my head. 

Honestly, when she started talking loudly, I totally have no decent comeback and was thinking this time confirm kena STOMP liao. But she gave me the BEST REBUTTAL when she said the “…people who have small baby…”, which I used when I look at her straight in her eye and said: “THEN HOW YOU KNOW I NOT PREGNANT?” She opened her mouth ready to argue before staring at me incredulously and then closed her mouth and look away. 

I mean yes I am young but I am also a woman so I have womb right?? I can be pregnant too right?? Or do I need to stick an ultrasound baby photo on my forehead to prove my pregnancy? I can be 2 months preggo but have skinny limbs? But in all seriousness, I not preggo but just PISSED AT HER COMMENT?? I was ready to pack up and leave the seat FOR HER then she just had to add in that comment. I know many friends who are not feeling well and just have to give their seats because they don’t want to look bad/scared kena STOMP. We may look young on the outside but who knows if we might recently had surgery, fever, pregnant or feeling giddy etc. And whenever young people like us ask for seats or refuse to give up seats, we are immediately judged unfairly or negatively. 

Continue on with the story, the auntie kept staring at me angrily after my rebuttal and I continued to put on my makeup, ignoring her. And the way she stared was so annoying, it’s the type that when you turn to look at her, she turns away then when you look away, then she will turn and look at you. I’m so done with her and she is getting on my nerves so I turned and just stared at her until she turned and met my eyes. Then I continued to maintain eye contact with her before I tilt my chin up then down in a “gangster” way which meant “what do you want now?” She immediately said “Whattttttttt?” in a loud and draggy way. I just roll my eyes and continued to do makeup. Then finally it’s my station and when I was getting off, I can see that she was staring at my stomach, trying to see if I’m pregnant lol.

I know I totally don’t deserve the seat but I just want to teach the auntie a lesson. I do still give up seats to REAL elderly, preggo ladies and injured ppl. Just to further justify my character, I once gave up a non reserved seat to a domestic helper who is younger than me because she asked me politely and told me that she isn’t feeling well and is a little giddy. And then people around us stared at us weirdly and gave judgemental looks. The girl saw their looks and looked awkwardly down at her feet.  
So yes, if you tell me that you want the seat or you are not feeling well, I will give you the seat. But please don’t add your discerning comments which just show how entitled you are. Don’t make young ppl’s gesture of good will become your entitlement bcos we don’t owe you anything. We pay same fares or even more sometimes. So even as a senior, please correct your attitude. You also know that the reason why you aimed me is bcos I’m the youngest person there sitting on a reserved seat and when someone older than me offer you a non reserved seat, it suddenly becomes “oh nvm nvm”.  Why is it nvm? Is it because young ppl like me deserved to stand or because her seat is not a reserved seat which you ARE ENTITLED  to? 

So hopefully this will teach her not to assume that all young ppl sitting on reserved seats don’t deserve it.  And a life tip to the ladies, just say you’re pregnant if you really need a seat. Please search your conscience and do it only if you really need it. But unless you’re a guy then my pro life tip can’t help you at all, sorry bro.

PS. Please share your burn stories with me and self-righteous ppl can just bugger off cos ain’t nobody got time for dat.",,1398,0.93

The men in the Telegram group are bad. We can all agree on that.

But we can't stop there. We can and need to find the root cause of the issue and help them out.

In discussion with a few people, we have agreed we can class these sexual deviants, including pedos, as mildly mentally ill, and hence need to be reached out rather than just told to be nice. This will be beneficial to everyone as a preventive measure.

Some proposed ideas are ~~legalisation~~ _promotion and regulation_ of prostitution as well as better sex ed. 

A hot point of debate is whether NS contributes to the issue. I think it does, but feel free to talk it out as I don't have a full conclusion yet.

Please be nice, and avoid general term and insults. Please also don't get too angry, if this pisses you off too much switch off, it's not worth getting mad at a Reddit thread.

696,I binged 6 hours of Toggle's The Last Madame cause I support local - Review and TLDR Inside!,dc7oj1,2019-10-02 09:10:03,"&#x200B;

[Pic from AsiaOne](https://i.redd.it/2z0bk0pag3q31.png)

So yesterday, I binge watched The Last Madame, the latest Toggle original starring Joanne Peh. Yep - I wanted to support local. Also because Fiona Fussi is a beautiful human. Now having watched all 12 half hour episodes in a row, I felt that I should pen my thoughts and give a condensed review to the SG redditors that aren’t planning to watch it. Cause why not.

Am I film student? A licensed critic? An experienced screenwriter? No x3, I just like films. But I spent 6 hours on a Toggle original, so I am gonna try make my national service of supporting local worth my while. Here goes - ***Toggle execs, I hope you see this.***

**TLDR:** The Last Madame was bad. Cringey bad. 5/10. The best scene in the whole show was the first 3 minutes in the pilot. But I rate other Mediacorp shows of the same genre 1-3/10, so thanks to bellcurve, TLM was a clear grade above the norm.

Now before I get attacked for airing my criticism frivolously, I wanna clarify that I am fully aware a lot of work went into this project, and that all parties involved probably wanted and did their best to see it go well. My criticism today largely covers **screenplay and direction**, not so much on the performances.

Now while TLM was bad TV in comparison to other works out there, it did leave me optimistic for the future of Singapore TV, cause it did many things right - more so than many of its predecessors. So I'm keeping an open mind. Read on.

# SPOILER ALERT. I tried to condense my thoughts below but if this gets more traction I might make a video going more in depth on my criticism.

**Quick overview:** The Last Madame is told across two arcs. A modern day arc (Fiona’s arc) and a flashback arc (Joanne’s arc). Fiona’s character, Chi Ling, is an investment banker from HK that returned home to SG to sell her great grandma’s (Joanne’s character) shophouse for 17 million (lmao). It is there where she bumps into history buff/pro-bono barber/plantation worker Guo Wen, who tells her that the shophouse belonged to an old Madame (Joanne’s char) of a brothel. Fiona says she’s not interested in his spiel, the guy protests, and they scuffle abit before falling over each other - Kdrama style, all within 40 seconds of meeting. *Sexy.*

So now her ankle is twisted, and plot dictates that she’s forced to sit around and listen to history nerd ramble about the brothel and her great grandma. We are then introduced to the flashback arc for Joanne’s character aka the Madame. The rest of the series goes on with to and fro jumps between past to present. The Madame arc is some weirdly written gang war/murder mystery flick that kind of functions, so I’m not gonna harp much on that plot wise.

After the Madame arc concludes, Fiona’s character decides that she needs to ditch that 17 million payout and KEEP the shophouse for herself (cause yknow - traditionz). But she does not have enough money to restore it so she SELLS her stocks in HK. But she still doesn’t have enough so homeboy Guo Wen pulls out the ultimate lifesaver by telling her he actually owns the plantation instead of just working there so he SELLS that too and they get enough money. Oh yea she also falls in love with Guo Wen. Did I mention she was engaged to her boss a week before?

Yep.

# The Good:

\- Editing was pretty solid to my normie eyes. No glaring lighting/conti errors or weird cuts - it was smooth. Fight scenes were painful but I dont think I’ll blame the editor for that.

\- The scene in the pilot before the intro credits. It introduced the theme of the show well with enough intensity and intrigue to pique my interest to say ""oooh not bad"". When they cut to the intro with the gasp, I almost clapped. Sadly, this was the best scene of the entire series for me.

\- Believable integration of singlish and 'proper speak' in the story.

\- Soundtrack. Dope af, loved the intro song (anyone know where it's from?)

\- Joanne Peh’s acting. I think I found her performance the strongest of all the cast members. Fiona’s wasn’t bad as well. Props to Brandon Wong for being very expressive with his rage too. But sadly, everything was ruined by the dialogue - but we’ll get to that later.

\- Sexiness + racy content. The “Joanne nude scene” (episode 9 for the researchers) and other sexy hooker scenes were honestly surprisingly realistic. Even the “semi rape” scene near the end was not the normal messy montage you see on Channel 8, the scene was actually pretty graphic and caught me by surprise. Overall, adult themes in the show were WAY more saucy than anything I’ve ever seen in local tv so it’s really cool to see local productions exploring more controversial topics. This compliment doesn't extend to the dialogue leading up to the sexy times sadly.

\- Small shoutout to Alan Wan's character, Chi Ling's fiance. The handsome dude was actually the most realistic character out there. He behaved exactly how a young investment banker boss would. They wrote him as rich douche, but he turned out to be the best dude and overturned quite a few stereotypes.

# The Bad:

\- Forced themes. I understand that stuff like cultural preservation is a must talk about topic especially if a film is “gov funded” or whatever, but the whole “we must preserve” messaging was REALLY in your face the entire time. Likewise for the underlying feminist themes. It was a tad overdone. It didn’t help that these forced themes were often prioritised over plot and character development.

\- The protagonists. Both Fiona and Joanne’s characters were passive protagonists with unrealistic or unclear goals which made them really unsympathetic characters to follow. (Fiona’s character much more so because her entire arc was low stakes. If she failed, she would sell the house for 17 million and not find out about her great grandmother. Hardly world ending. At least the Madame would have been wrongly accused of murder.)

\- The modern arc was unnecessary. Apart from serving a function to open and close the Madame arc, the entire modern arc could have been axed. What we got was corny channel 5 plot filler nonsense with an unbelievable romance plot woven into it. The only real purpose of the modern arc was exposition. Next point.

\- **Too much exposition.** Characters constantly provided unnecessary exposition in their dialogue, completely disregarding ‘show not tell’. “Oh do you mean we are looking for a spy?” “Are you telling me last night meant nothing?” “Did you know that this gang is the fiercest gang” etc etc. *Maybe* the show was targeted to older folk with slower grasp on plot concepts, but honestly, I dont see my granny watching local brothel drama. She’d be shaking her head so much at the harlots she’d miss half the show.

\- Chemistry and romance. None of the leads had romantic chemistry with each other, and it made the already terrible story writing and hookups extra unbelievable.  This point is extra sad cause I know Joanne mentioned she wanted to go nude for the show cause it would exhibit the character's inner turmoils and passions better. But that's just it. The characters were so poorly written that none of that served any purpose cause I didn't believe they were infatuated - it was rushed and forced. I think I actually compressed myself into my chair 3-4 times during my watch yelling *""Wtf you're banging??!""*

\- Too many dick jokes. *I'm serious.* I get it, it's a brothel and ya'll nasty gals, but the random dick jokes out of nowhere were super cringe and takes the mood out of serious scenes. :(

# The Ugly:

\- The dialogue. The dialogue in this show was ***horrendous***. Exposition every 4 sentences. Lines that do not sound like what normal people would say. And the seduction lines were ***tear jerking***.

# BUT...

The Last Madame showed that we have the potential. The shell - editing, production quality, soundtrack, acting chops (kinda), was there. But I believe a **good screenplay was all that was missing** to carry that shell to a respectable level. We are close - I think.

Finally, to answer the age old Singaporean rebuttal to arguments - *you so smart you can do better meh?*

Yes, I really think I can write a better screenplay than what we got.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

700,Some personal thoughts on the recent PSLE math papers complaints,dc78rm,2019-10-02 08:11:25,"I thought there are two interesting phenomena perhaps worth looking into regarding our PSLE math exam:

1.	Of the 4 PSLE subjects, Math is the one that kenna complained almost every year. Why specifically Math?

2.	Yet, there seemed to be little or no complaint of the Math papers last year. What happened? Is it because it’s manageable? Is it a bad thing?

.

**The issue of differentiation**

-	Regarding the difficulty of PSLE math questions, one common point raised is that we need to differentiate the students. But I think we might need to examine deeper just what this differentiation is needed for, especially with regards to PSLE.

-	Is it to solve administrative problems like school allocation? Is it to help students learn better by splitting them into different groups? What is the purpose of this differentiation?

-	If the purpose of differentiation, is to split students into different groups after PSLE, then it is similar to streaming. We would then have to probe deeper into the issues of early-age differentiation/streaming. Is Primary Six an appropriate time to stream?

-	Returning to the 2nd phenomenon I wrote at the top, there seemed to be no complaints about the PSLE Math paper last year. Is it going to be a big problem for that batch of students in terms of differentiation?

-	And just what is the main purpose of PSLE anyway? I think we need more conversations on this issue.

.

**PSLE differentiation and ‘arms race’**

-	An emphasis on the need to differentiate students through PSLE can fuel a competitive vicious-cycle, sort of like an ‘arms race’. This is what I speculate can happen:

-	In order to compete and differentiate themselves from the rest of the cohort, students would need to study harder. In order to compete and differentiate their child from the rest of the cohort, many parents would engage tutors to help improve their kid’s result. So overall, there is likely a general increase in the students’ ability to handle the PSLE Math papers.

-	But because of this increased overall ability, PSLE exam board would have to set tougher and tougher questions just to so-called differentiate strong students from the rest, because the formerly tough questions are no longer tough enough anymore.

-	And as the questions get tougher year by year, students would need to work even harder year by year, as the bar is raised even higher and higher. Such that hiring Math tutors become even more of a ‘necessity’ to many parents. Which makes the exam board try to set even tougher questions just to so-called differentiate students. 

-	So just when is this bar high enough?

-	Of course, this is just my speculation. But perhaps there may be some truth to it, especially in the area of Math. Why is the PSLE Math paper often singled out? I find that interesting.

-	I think the recent move by MOE on banding the PSLE results may help in de-emphasizing differentiation and the ‘arms-race’. Let’s see what happens.

.

**On the need to have more think-out-of-the-box problems in exam**

-	I have actually done a few past year PSLE Math papers and past year O-Level Math papers (yup, I’m a parent). My feel is that, the O-Level Math papers are more straightforward and manageable. The PSLE Math papers, not so. 

-	One reason is that I can use algebra equations for O-Level, whereas some of the problem sums in PSLE are made unnecessarily difficult because of the cumbersome model method.

-	Another reason is that O-Level questions seem pretty standard to me, whereas PSLE questions are less standard. Not sure why this is so.

-	Perhaps there is the misconception that by setting more indirect and think-out-of-the-box questions in a Math exam, we are encouraging creative problem-solving and thinking skills in our education system. But the fact is, to effectively tackle a Math exam like our current PSLE system, there is a need to actually drill and practise more.
 
-	The fact of our PSLE system is that, a student has only limited time and energy to try to complete a full Math exam paper. He/she can’t afford to spend too much time on all the questions. He/she must be able to recognise most of the questions immediately and work on them, then there’s a chance to complete the paper in time. 

-	And the only way for this to happen, is drill-and-practice. Then most of the questions would be familiar to the student. He/she can then work much faster and with much less effort during the exam, saving time and energy to tackle the few challenging and atypical ones. 

-	So by incorporating more and more indirect and thinking questions in an exam, we might actually be ‘forcing’ students to drill-and-practice more, just to be able to cope with finishing the exam paper.

-	Our current system of examination is not really suitable for examining thinking skills and creative problem-solving.  Until the mode of assessment is changed, trying to incorporate more atypical questions into the exam paper only forces the students to drill-and-practice more so that these atypical questions can become typical ones to them, and the paper can be completed in time.

.

I think there is some validity to the complaints parents make about the difficulty of the PSLE Math paper. We shouldn't dismiss them too easily. 

Again going back to the two phenomena I mentioned at the top, why so.

Coupled with the rising suicide rate among youngsters and the many sexual offences committed by tertiary students and the issues of privilege and class-divides and SES segregation and what-not, I think we need to look deeper into education issues and try to sort them out as a whole. There may be certain common themes threading them all that we are failing to see at the moment.

705,Minister Shanmugam points out lessons Singapore can learn from HK protests,dc67ae,2019-10-02 06:02:25," 

Singapore— Speaking at the Minister’s Awards Presentation Ceremony at ITE College West on September 30, Monday, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam pointed out several key lessons that the country can learn from Hong Kong’s troubled past few months.

His main point was that it took just a short while for the world’s regard for Hong Kong police, long believed to be among the finest in the region, to change. Along with it came as well a change in Hong Kong’s relations to the rest of the world.

Mr Shanmugam described the present condition in Hong Kong as “people versus the police,” according to a report from [the Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shanmugam-highlights-3-lessons-for-singapore-from-hong-kong-unrest) (ST).

The Minister said that in 2017, a public perception survey that came out revealed 90 percent of Singaporeans trust Home Team officers to perform their tasks with integrity and objectivity, and that they relied on these officers to ably handle times of national crises.

#### But he cautioned that “This cannot be taken for granted, and we cannot assume that it will always be there.”

\- Advertisement -

The Hong Kong police, he added, had been believed to be “disciplined, highly professional, effective.” However, due to the protests since June, as well as the stories that have come out in the press, demonstrators have been portrayed as those championing the cause of democracy, and police officers have been shown from a less flattering perspective.

Mr Shanmugam says this has caused “unfair criticism” for the police.

From this situation, the Home Affairs and Law Minister extracted three important lessons.

Number one, he said that internal agencies do not always provide the most important answers.

### “They are a solution for tactical problems, but the problems (in Hong Kong) first of all start from politics, and the fundamental socio-economic issues,” Mr Shanmuham noted.

“The responsibility starts with the government to get the basic issues right in society… If the fundamental issues are wrong, and 10,000 people go on the streets every day or every week, no police force I think can deal with it, including in Singapore.”

Lesson number two is that Ministers need to take responsibility in these kinds of contexts, instead of the police. Making a reference to the incident in 2016 wherein a 14-year-old boy who had been allegedly involved in a molest case was found dead.

Back then the Minister said,”My ministry has the responsibility for the protocol that is in place. And ultimately, responsibility is with me, as the minister. It is not with the individual police officers. Their responsibility is to act according to the protocol in place.”

He echoed this in his speech on September 30, emphasizing that responsibility lies with “the people right at the top, not the individual officers facing the public on the ground.”

For the third lesson from the Hong Kong protests, Mr Shanmugam pointed out how crucial it is that the public is fully informed about events that occur.

”Because if we leave an information void, the public will turn to unverified sources, rumours… It will happen anyway, but you’ve got to try and prevent it.”/ TISG",,13,0.7

1) 4 years degree
2) self study based (i have a friend who goes to school only once a week)
3) lack of cca or student bonding
4) lack of facilities and common space

which sounds fookin boring

i’ve come to a point where i no longer see much value in a “local uni cert” and tbh, i just wanna get a degree and enjoy the last few years of my studies before i become a corporate slave 9-5 squeeze in MRT jk but yea i’ve been thinking of switching to SIM GE instead since it’s faster and has more student life.

nonetheless, i’d like to know what you guys think? if any of you been to SIM GE or SUSS and can give me some insights on life in campus?

thanks!

716,National unity?,dc3pw6,2019-10-02 01:59:53,"I feel that our country is the way it is now because of mistrust amongst the people.

Business owners view employees with disdain because of policies that promote government goodwill at the expense of company profitability. So contract jobs and contractor style hiring is the trend to protect businesses. 

Employees view business owners with victim mentality because the government promised higher wages and better lives but businesses are not delivering this promise. Instead wages have stagnated. People also do not understand why flexihours cannot be applied to customer service staff in clinics, retail, tuition and fnb. So when people feel that they are unfairly compensated, we only put in the amount of commitment and effort that we think commensurates with our pay. 

The old lament the lack of respect for the elderly because of advocacy by the government that somehow they are deserving of payback by the generations after them. They also blame companies for discriminating against them and choosing to replace them with younger workers. They feel that they have the right to retire regardless of how much they saved before and the nation as a whole should come together to finance this because they 'helped built the nation'. 

The young bemoan the unfairness of having to support the old when they are barely surviving themselves. High housing prices that grant windfall to the generation 20 years ago now impede their ability to own their own property. People associate starting families with more bills first and foremost before anything else.

766,Unreasonable and Entitled Customer,dbn9y2,2019-10-01 03:20:32,"Hi guys, I just wanna ask if this customer in question is being unreasonable af or is it just me for being a shitty service provider.

Recently, there's this customer who wanted to buy one of my dresses and requested to meet at her church at 4.30-5pm. So I went there and guess what? I waited until 5.40pm and there's no sight of her, nor could I manage to get a hold on her via messages. Then after 6.30pm, she replied and said that her phone ran out of battery. So okay, nvm I thought. And then she proceeded to blame me for not being visible at our meeting location when I WAITED 1 hour, standing like a fool carrying heavy bags so I went to sit down at a nearby chair which is like 10m away. So okay fine. We arranged to meet up on the next day but I've requested for a deposit first.

Next day, everything went smoothly but a few hours after the meetup, she told me that her neckline wasn't low enough like the photo shown, and accused me of being dishonest. Despite me being open to customers to try out the dresses FIRST with no commitments of buying before purchasing it. Normally I would go out of my way and even exchange dresses for them if they couldn't wear it. But this is a case of picking a needle in an ocean for mistakes imho. She's blaming me for not being able to sell a dress that can fit 100% her abnormal body size (everything else fitted nicely, it's just that the neckline isn't 3cm lower irl like the photo), and despite me putting disclaimers first before the deal, yet she still blames me and requested a refund. Literally nobody had problems with my stuff unless it's something genuine like a factory mistake. She could request to come and try it first before buying but apparently she's too busy on her schedule and nobody else is busy. Except her. So now her shortcomings got labelled as my fault.

Before asking for a refund, she wanted an exchange based on this opinion of hers, so I told her that I'm unable to fulfil it as I've put in more cash and time than I'm supposed to in order to deliver 2 times (2nd time pro bono out of goodwill), so I told her that if she can foot out $8 for a third party deliveryman, then by all means I'm fine with it. But she couldn't, and now she wants a refund. I'm transparent throughout this ordeal and even told her the market rates for shippers.

So tell me, am I being dishonest? Am I not accomodating enough to waive the second delivery fee because of her silly mistake at the first one?",,37,0.81

\-These lime scooters and other companies are more prominent (I've seen them more often in Paris as well)  


And also some friends here seem to enjoy the escooters as a casual device.

And then 

Oh no! The wild monkey fled!

And began feasting on the mango tree outside her place. I don’t know what happened but presuming that it fled after eating the mangoes, it’s likely that it “da-baoed” the mango and scurried off

She then called NEA and they said it was a stray monkey( it was only one )

So I was just wondering if there was any sort of niche market or interests in colourisation of images in Singapore (i.e. external classes I can take or some archival that takes interests in such things).

(Sorry reposted this as well in another thread because I want to hear as much opinion as possible) 

I’m going to ORD in 4 days, despite my best efforts to teach my understudy: complete with detailed step guides and individual emails detailing each individual topic in my job scope, my understudy refuses to learn anything.

My encik is very frustrated with him but decided to pin a large part of the blame on me for not teaching or handing over properly. 

I have spent over 6 months trying to teach him with 4 different copies of detailed guides on my job. 

But now I am going to ORD my encik threatened to hold me back from my ORD if my understudy doesn’t learn his job or that I didn’t “hand over properly” 

Is this even possible? I have literally never heard of this happening before. The only thing I know that can hold anyone back is a chargeable offense but at the very most it’ll be a charge of insubordination? Which is a extremely far fetched charge because there is black and white proof of me reaching my understudy and actually having multiple signed copies of HOTO documents",,154,0.94

823,Thoughts / Opinions about Life,db5rp3,2019-09-30 03:28:05,"Maybe due to my age (25-35 years old), I see A LOT of engagements / proposals / weddings / baby showers / young kids' birthday parties (especially this) across all my social media feeds. Everyone always seems so happy at these events, and take all these as opportunities to catch up with friends they haven't met in a long time. It always seems like a jovial time and I usually take this opportunity to revel in the 'family atmosphere' (e.g. tiny toddlers running around playing with balloons, having fun while their parents sternly tell them to sit at the table and eat, leading to them playfully grabbing their kids off the ground haha). I didn't grow up in a close-knit family so seeing all these, sometimes I find myself wistfully wishing that.. I could be like that someday, with a nice little family of my own.

But behind the scenes of all these social events, I hear first-hand accounts of couples changing their minds and going their separate ways after the proposals, stories of men/women cheating on their respective partners while planning for their weddings, first-time parents quarreling badly with each other as to how they should care for their baby, women/men with young kid(s) below 2 yrs old but seriously considering divorcing their respective partners (already in discussion) and I feel.. very sad. I can't help but to worry about my own relationship and my future life because, the majority of negative stories seem so much more than positive stories, and the ones posting/posted all these happy events on their social media actually ended up in the negative stories. The positive stories are far and few in between.

I wonder if this is really just the harsh reality of life and that most people actually have behind-the-scenes sad stories but only post happy events on social media to showcase(?) or give the perception that they are happy, doing well, enjoying their life or, I just happen to be in a community of mixed friends where most people just tend to end up this way.

This post is not a question to be answered but just kind of an.. internal reflection for me and I just wanted to throw out my thoughts/observations on this anonymous platform. If you have anything to share (whether positive/negative stories, or just your own thoughts/opinions/observations), please feel free to share.",,162,0.94
824,Wildlife in Singapore; Part 47: Golden-bellied Gerygone,db5bl7,2019-09-30 02:47:50,"Hi r/singapore, this week I'll be talking about a bird that is often heard but not easily seen, the [Golden-bellied Gerygone](https://singaporebirds.com/species/golden-bellied-gerygone/) (*Gerygone sulphurea*), which also goes by the old name of Flyeater.

With a body length of 10 centimetres, this is one of the smallest birds found in Singapore. Its size, combined with the tendency to spend most of its time high up in the trees, make this species quite challenging to spot. The Golden-bellied Gerygone is an insectivore that inhabits mangroves, forest edges, woodland, and scrub, but has adapted to parks as well as urban areas. [Its call](https://besgroup.org/2014/10/21/golden-bellied-gerygone-serenading/) is often heard coming from trees along the roadside and in residential areas.

[The nest](https://flic.kr/p/fkxiCL) is a purse-shaped structure that is suspended from a tree branch. Unfortunately, in Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia, the Golden-bellied Gerygone is often [parasitised by the Little Bronze Cuckoo](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2018/07/28/brood-parasite-golden-bellied-gerygones-hosting-a-little-bronze-cuckoo/), and it's not uncommon to find a Golden-bellied Gerygone nest, only to return some time later to see the parents feeding a Little Bronze Cuckoo fledgling.

Interestingly, the Golden-bellied Gerygone is the only member of its family present west of the [Wallace Line](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-wallace-line-1224711), the [invisible biogeographical boundary](https://www.asiangeo.com/heritage/wallace-line-kangaroo-meets-monkey/) that separates many of the animals and plants of Asia from those of the Australasian region. The family Acanthizidae, which contains the gerygones, as well as other birds such as [scrubwrens](http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Sericornis-frontalis) and [thornbills](http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthiza-chrysorrhoa), is almost exclusively Australasian. Most of the 66 members of this family are endemic to Australia, New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and the Lesser Sunda and Maluku Islands of Indonesia, with one species of gerygone in New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, and another two species of gerygone in New Zealand. Only one species in this family is found as far west as the Southeast Asian mainland - the Golden-bellied Gerygone. It is distributed from the southern tip of Vietnam, southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore to Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, the Philippines, Sulawesi, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.

We're a group of 4 young adults looking to test a new business idea and we're looking for feedback!

Recently, one of us had a personal experience with death of a loved one and dealing with funeral services.

Going through the process of picking a funeral service, we realised that funerals services often lack transparency and can almost be downright predatory sometimes (upselling!). It caused us to wonder: why there isn't a platform where we could easily compare funeral service prices easily and quickly find the one that best suits your needs?

We looked online and there simply wasn't anything out there like it. So we decided to build it ourselves:

[hereandafter.org](https://hereandafter.org/)

It works like how a regular online marketplace would:

1. You enter the criteria you require for a funeral service

2. We match you to the one that's most suitable for you 

We've been in touch with many funeral services, collected information and we want to help Singaporeans find the services they need, without falling prey to bad service or predatory tactics. 

We are not currently operating for profit and we'd love to hear your feedback on it. If you have a need for this or know someone who does, feel free to give it a try!",,290,0.94

There's a beef ball episode that is pretty amazing, and featured a bunch of muscly guys pounding beef and meticulously picking out stringy fibres for really good quality meatballs. The meatballs have very little filler and are made extremely tender and smooth. They showed another muscly uncle who pounds his own beef and makes only 50kg worth of beef balls a day. Close to the end of the episode a man was seen ordering his beef balls and said he's sending it to Singapore. 

Anyone has any clue where on this island I can find the Chaoshan meatballs? I'm sure it's not going to be in supermarkets because it's very limited quantity, and also I assume it's highly likely going to be in the form of a noodle soup dish. I googled and it's mostly Hainanese beef ball noodles (nothing wrong with those, absolutely adore them too), but the beef balls don't look the same. Does anyone knows where I can find the baby-bum-smooth type of beef balls in Singapore? Or did the guy order it for himself and isn't intending sharing this delicious food? Or could it be found in a high class Teochew restaurant?

908,NUS Student OM case which is now going into appeal - Some clarification and notes.,dabw7i,2019-09-28 05:20:24,"Thought I would throw some light on some issues about this case and why the strong reaction and correct some misinterpretation.

* The law does not give any prerogative power to the judge contrary to belief in some quarters. Judges have to follow not only the law which specifies the punishment spectrum but also the sentencing guidelines issued by the Judiciary. These sentencing guidelines are worked out on the recommendation of the authorities and AG so there is consistency across the Board. Theses are revised to keep in line with what society needs and expects.
* The outcry was not because he was given probation for OM but because the acts he committed clearly did not warrant probation. This was no ordinary OM - He did it, she moved away, she left the train and he followed and did it again and this time it was even worse, he ran his fingers down her genitals. Hence the rare event where the DPP immediately asked for a stay in execution of the sentence and I suspect not only because he knew the judge had erred seriously but to save her as well. She did not realise it and refused the request.
* Good grades as a mitigant are given all the time by defence attorneys in most cases to impress their clients knowing full well it does not stand a chance in most cases. And this was not an ordinary act of OM. He was bold enough to chase after her and doing it again and the second time it was even worse.
* Typically cases involving students must be referred by the Police to AG for approval to prosecute. In deserving cases the AG has the prerogative power (this is true prerogative and exclusive power that AG has) to recommend a warning if the individual is a good student. In this case, the conduct was so egregious that they gave the greenlight to prosecute despite his background. The judge would know of this procedure as she was once a DPP herself prosecuting cases.
* OM cases are handled by our Courts on a daily basis so it is not rare or uncommon. This particular judgement immediately caught the attention of the court reporters and they knew it was wrong. When it made the news, most people realised that the judge made a mistake. The Police extract below shows how common OM cases are  for the first half of 2019.

>13. The number of Outrage of Modesty (OM) cases increased by 5% to 837 in the first half of 2019, from 797 in the same period in 2018.  
>  
>Outrage of modesty on public transport remains a concern  
>  
>14. OM cases on the public transport system, including public transportation nodes and on public transport, have decreased but remain a concern due to the high number of cases reported.

Tomorrow there might be a case where an NUS student with good grades and a good probation report for OM might actually be granted probation and it would not cause a concern at all because in such case, it was an impulsive act and he touched his victim with no pre-mediation once. There must always be element of rehabilitation for second chances for deserving cases. And people accept that.

In the case of Monica Baey and in this recent case, the conduct of both students did not relate even remotely to an ordinary OM cases. In the first, he was not even a resident of the Hall. He had no business there. It was also not impulsive or an out of character act. The camera caught him prowling and checking cubicles in the female toilet etc.

So in both these OM incidents they are not the run of the mill cases. Pre-mediation was in the works. The Minister can help address these more serious cases by amending the laws and the judiciary can revise their sentencing guideline in the meantime. There is already specific provisions in law to handle OM in confined cases such as lift where enhanced punishment is allowed for.

Hope this helps.",,441,0.95

926,[Scam alert] Scam call centre poising as Singtel rep selling internet service,da1w2z,2019-09-27 15:18:37,"I received a call this afternoon from a man telling me that he is a representative from singtel and he was trying to sell me internet service. I could also hear from his background that there are 3-4 voices (both men and women) behind doing the same thing (possibility speaking to other potential victims). All of them had this strong Indian accent which led me to believe that the scam centre could be from India. There were many suspicions here and there during our conversation and I even demanded to speak to their “manager” (I knew for sure it’s a scam and I had some time to fool around). When the “manager” (probably his co- colleague cum scammer) picked up the call and started saying the same thing, I interrupted him and questioned if this is a scam call. He hanged up the phone immediately. 

I think the scam centre probably reached out to quite a few people today. Please do not believe in them and hang up. Hopefully no one got scammed. 

Number received : 9631 4506

PS: it saddens me that educated people in today’s world are willing to take up jobs even though they know it’s morally wrong to scam. But who am I to judge when they had to do this to survive and put food on their table for their children.

I will introduce myself first. I am a NSF, 19 years old. Currently serving the nation for about 10 months. I am in a vocation which is quite tough.

 I recently get tired of my life, I lose my motivation to do anything. I usually have a list of to do each day. However, I did nothing much everyday. I just feel exhausted to do anything.

I also don't feel loved. I feel ignored by the society, like nobody cares about me. They tend to care the good lookings and the popular. I know I am ugly, but that does not mean I am not human! Sometimes this drive me crazy. I just need a little love please.

Next, in a NS vocation which need some to chiong sua, I feel extremely exhausted. I just need a break alone. 

Talking to friends about this is complicated. I could write a 300 page essay about what happen in my life. Not even my closest friend know my exact situation.

Sometimes I feel like eating the muzzle of my weapon and ending my life with a shot. But here are the reasons why I did not.

1. My death would make my family to collapse totally. I have thought and analyse on what happen if I commit suicide. I love my family despite all the shit, I don't want them to suffer.
2. I have some close and wonderful friends. They are mature and nice. They spend time with me and I have wonderful memories with them.
3. I have big dreams to achieve in life. I want to achieve them in my lifetime.
4. Suicide is never an option.

Now, you might tell me to see a psychiatrist. Here are some problems.

1. My parents will be shock and people will look at me differently. I NEVER show my saddeness to anyone much. I usually will laugh and make lame jokes around my friends. They will never think I am depress deep inside.
2. I might not be able to cope financially. Now as a NSF, the cost of psychiatrist consultation is cover by SAF. After I ORD, I cover the cost. The cost is definitely something I am not able to handle.
3. A mental health record on me might make my future employer unwilling to take me up for a job. I did well for my exams and I don't want to destroy my future.
4. My fellow NsF mates and PC will think I am a chao keng as I did not tell them about how I feel. I usually am a happy person who seems to enjoy life.

My mind is filled with sadness, anger and confusion. So I reach out to yall for help. Please lend me a helping hand, pull me out from hell. Thanks angels.",,94,0.86

The stalls have fixed prices, the signboards are there, there is literally no reason to change the portion sizes based on race. Regardless of what business owners feel about race, I don't think anyone would do anything to be stingy with a customer on racial grounds.

The only explanation I have is: there are a fair number hawker staller owners who will scalp when they can, and a lot of customers do not call them out on it. I have had hawkers attempt to ""round off"" to the nearest dollar for no reason - be they Chinese, Malay or Indian - and I have had to call them out on it each time before they go ""oh sorry sorry I thought you ordered this one also"" and they back off. I have also had people scrimp on portions - be they Chinese, Malay or Indian - and these cases I see them do it for everyone in that line on that particular day. There's no discernible difference in portions depending on the customer's race, until the customer asks for more.

Is it really a case of discriminatory serving different portions, or just a case of businessmen and businesswomen lowkey swindling unsuspecting customers until they're called out on it?

I've been here 8 years, I eat in hawker centers all the time all across the island, and I've yet to see this ""non-Malay serving/pricing"".

Am I wrong? Am I missing the bigger picture? Outside of frankly dubious anecdotes of this ""non-Malay pricing"", have there been particularly notable incidents that gave rise to this belief?",,71,0.87

-‐--------

[ Molest Case ]
 
There has been a fair bit of reaction to the verdict in this case. Terence Siow who molested a woman at Serangoon MRT was setenced to probation. The victim, has also made her views clear.
 
I will make a few points :
 
1.   People are entitled to express their views, unhappiness, with the verdict, and their feelings that the punishment is inadequate.
2.   I can also understand how the victim and her parents must feel. The father wrote to me. Many of us ( speaking for myself as a parent), will feel the same way.
3.   I was surprised, myself, with the verdict.
4.   I therefore asked AGC for their views. AGC officers told me that they disagreed with the verdict, and that they intend to appeal. That is consistent with my views as well.
5.   I will add this : while people feel strongly about the case, we nevertheless should avoid casting aspersions personally on judges – they are doing their duty, to the best of their abilities.

We should now let the Appeal Court look at the matter.
 
The Courts will decide according to the law, on the facts before them.
 
If, after the Appeal is decided, we, as a society, still generally believe that the law should deliver a different outcome, then it is not the Courts’ fault.
 
It is then for Parliament to deal with that, change the law. And people know – in Singapore, the Government will move, and put legislation before Parliament to consider.

- Easier time for poly students
- Specialise in engineering courses

NUS: 
- Name recognition
- More international students, greater networking potential
- Can get away with crimes like molestation if I score well and show potential in my future
