1,Expired Passport and no MyKad,dj4rbb,2019-10-17 11:00:29,"Hi everyone,

I was born in Malaysia to a Malaysian dad and foreign mother. My passport and citizenship is Malaysian. 

I left Malaysia as a young child(pre-MyKad) and have not returned since then. My passport has expired and it's been over a decade now. I've overstayed in the country I'm currently living in. I do not have any other IC's other than my birth certificate and my expired passport. 

Would it be possible to renew my passport and apply for MyKad while abroad?

Thank you.",,3,1.0

5,Seeking advice on continuing my studies,dj30z2,2019-10-17 07:41:42,"so I'm taking SPM this year and I'm pretty much clueless in what happens after high school. During SPM trials, i (miraculously) achieved decent grades and my family had told me to start applying to universities and scholarships. First off, my entire life i had wished to study abroad and so I tried to do a bit of research just to be bombarded with foreign informations. Take note that I've been secluded and never really had any plans for the future. Coming from a middle-income family, scholarships are essential for me to continue my study especially since i long to study in the UK.

I'm also planning to take mathematics as my undergraduate course and I'm a little insecure at my competency since my only qualification is SPM (i'm in the art stream taking prinsip akaun, econs. and addmaths). I'm wondering just how different is additional mathematics in SPM with Further Mathematics in A-Level.",,4,0.7

So I went to the embassy's website and they mentioned that people from my country have to apply through an agency. So I look for the available agencies and my friend recommended one for me. Anyways, I talked to the guy and he told me the requirements and mentioned that the process will take 5 DAYS. I submitted my documents on 24th of September as well as the payment. After that, I was completely ghosted by the agent on WhatsApp and he didn't answer my calls. On the 12th of October, I told him that I wanted my money back and that visa is no longer of any use to me. On the friggin 16th of October, he texted me that the Visa was issued and the process was prolonged because of some issues with the passport. I tracked the reference number of the application and turns out he submitted the application on the 13th of October, AFTER I asked him to cancel it. I confronted him and he keeps giving me null excuses.

So what can I do now? I have the full conversation with him and the payment I have done, as well as his promise that it would be done within 5 days.

tl;dr: applied for Singaporean Visa using an agent, promised me it would finish within five days, and he submitted the application after 19 days, what can I do?

Edit1: He offered me a 50% discount if I apply for Singapore the NEXT TIME (He would still be making around a RM90 profit, and the money I paid for the current one is thrown in the trash)...the nerves of this guy...",,9,1.0

15,How to check the reason of getting Blacklisted by imigresen as a foreigner?,dj18bx,2019-10-17 04:25:23,"A friend of mine is currently on MM2H. Last time when he entered Malaysia in September, he was stopped by imigresen. They told him he is blacklisted at backend but he still has MM2H so they let him enter after 30 minutes. Now, he tried asking an agent to confirm if he is blacklisted and if he is, what is the reason? The agent confirmed that he is blacklisted but couldn't find the reason because file says ""private and confidential"" and only higher rank officers can open it.

So, is there any way to check it if the agent is lying or not? If he isn't, how can my friend find out the actual reason of him being blacklisted so he can hire a lawyer and appeal? Thank you in advance.",,4,0.72

26,Does it normally take this long to get a slot for the JPJ driving exam?,ditdzf,2019-10-16 18:21:03,"Hello I'm non Malaysian learning to drive. I started my lessons last October and I'm concerned because I know that the LDL licence can only be renewed up to two years. My driving instructor is an agent and I do my lessons at safety driving center in PJ. I finished my required hrs fairly early on then I was required to do a mock driving exam which needed booking, this took a while to get a slot. I failed this mock exam the first time mostly out of nerves and mostly because I didn't realise I was supposed to practice outside of school (I was told it's illegal so I heeded that, oops) the guy really ripped into me and then after I got scolded for lack of confidence.  


Waited months again then passed my next mock exam because the lady was playing candy crush so didn't feel so nervous and drove much better. I finally got a slot for my driving exam early September, unfortunately I failed parallel parking. They couldn't book me in again till November which I couldn't do because of my mum visiting so now my exam isn't till December.  


My resits are costing 250myr so it's frustrating to wait so long. I know other places don't usually make you book mock driving exams which took up a lot of time. Is it possible for me to book my exam elsewhere or am I locked into this school now? Is it possible to switch agent, I don't really like my instructor he confuses left and right and generally rants about inappropriate personal issues and comments on my marriage. Honestly I'm concerned I'll fail again next time not really because of my driving but because I find the officers quite intimidating, I'm probably a bit sensitive. Retaking isn't a problem but the long delays between exams is.

Not sure if this is an appropriate sub to post in, but I'm currently a Malaysian working in the US and planning to invest in retirement accounts in the US(401k, Roth and traditional IRA). Does anyone on this sub have experience with this? My ultimate goal is definitely to retire in Malaysia(Malaysia has better healthcare and better food), but the tax advantaged accounts seem too good to pass up. What are the tax consequences of moving money from a 401k to Malaysia? Do we have a tax treaty? Should I avoid the tax-advantaged accounts and just go for regular brokerage accounts? I'll be earning a substantial sum while working here, so I'm hoping to protect it the best I can.",,4,0.6

I'm not close to my Indian relatives but I sometimes meet them. Though most of them are racist, so I have only some of my dad's relatives and this story take solace at my uncle's house. So when I was 6, every time my family would go to KL, we would stay at my uncle's place(my dad's eldest brother) because we couldn't afford a hotel so we would stay there. Now to provide some context, all of my dad's siblings are Hindu. My dad converted to Christianity at like 19 when he moved to Sabah to be a teacher. So, at the  place where the cars are parked in the house, there is a Hindu shrine. Every night or so, he would bring food as offering to the gods in the shrine. My dad would always told me to *not* eat the food. The food my uncle prepared was fresh and could see the steam coming out. I peeked to see and I saw the steam go towards the statue in the shrine ( I don't know the name of what God or goddess he worships). This shook 6 year old me. So my stupid curiosity came over me and decided to taste the food when no one was looking. The food was cold and tasteless. After that I couldn't sleep and I could see something standing in the corner of the room where my family slept. I told my dad and he scolded me and basically prayed for me and I didn't see anything after that. Surprisingly that was the last time we would stay in that house overnight.
The second story takes place at my mother's village in Sabah during Christmas. I love all my Dusun relatives as they aren't racist. So my dad would drive my family to the village every Christmas and it was a 3 hour drive from the town I live in. I was 11 years old when this happened. So during the sermon when the pastor was preaching about Christmas, I wanted to pee and went to the toilet. The church was a small kampung house so you would have to go outside to the toilet. It was around 10 pm. I went to the toilet and looked out towards the vast sight of Palm oil trees and saw a very tall wolf-like or animal-like creature staring at me( at least that what I think it was, it was kinda dark but I could still see it). It was around I would say 60 meters away. After 10 seconds of me scared shitless it turned and walked towards the mountains. I'm pretty sure I peed my pants and told my mum. She just told me to go back to my grandparents house. Keep in mind, in this kampung all the houses are close by, so me and my mum walked home which took about 5 minutes. My grandpa was the only one at the house with me and my mum as he was a bit sick. My mum told my grandpa that I peed my pants and he just laughed. While my mum was looking for some clean pants for me, my grandpa asked why did I peed in my pants. I told him what I saw and he just went blanked. He told me if the creature approached me and I say it didn't. My grandpa was relieved. He told me when he was young and was exploring the nearby mountains, he saw a creature that matched my description. He told me the creature stared at him and walked away. He ran back and never went back in. He said ancestors use to do some rituals on the mountain and said it could be a demon. But he himself is not sure. He once heard a story of one British guy who came and wanted to explore mountain died with claw marks on his body when the village found him. My grandpa was 4 years old when this happened but no one in the village remembers an event like this so he thinks it just might be a ghost story. But 6 years later and I have never seen that creature again. I always wonder what I saw that night. I told my mum this but she said it's just my mind playing tricks on you.

153,[Throaway Account] Why the hell is our labour protection laws are so inadequate and the workers so happy being oppressed?,dh9wli,2019-10-13 12:23:15,"Alright for context, I've been working since I was a wee little lad at the age of 16 at a fast food restaurant with a sassy girl on twitter as its mascot. From then I jumped through many different jobs till I finally landed on on my current one which is probably among them, the shittiest.

Its a not-to-be-named retail chain giant.

I had worked in so many places where overtime is forcefully pushed onto you via peer pressure, [the managers imply its optional but if you don't do it the rest of your colleague will give you the stink eyes] because they complain that there's a lot of work to be done but HQ or the manager themselves will refuse to hire additional workers. [Apparently its my fault for not taking on extra work due to their failure to delegate work properly and to ensure training is properly provided.]

Furthermore in 2-3 workplace those overtimes are NOT PAID. They tell you it is but when you check the payslip its the usual pay and you have been bamboozled. In my current workplace people are woke are afraid of contacting the ministry of labour for those abuse for fear of their names being leaked to the company [and subsequently blacklsited from future employer] or that the company will simply settle with the ministry with no actions taken. 

The main issue is that many companies in malaysia seems to flagrantly break the law as they see fit [Did you know you only have to work for 12 hours maximum including OT per day if your pay is blow 2K? i worked 15 hours before.] without a peep from the ministry to ensure these places are actually sticking to the law. Furthermore workers themselves seemed happy to be oppressed and any extra work without pay is phrased as ""You have to compromise with the company a little bit."" yet a compromise is two ways but only the company gets all the perk of the deal. They will also happily turn on anyone who rocks the boat, mainly because they see themselves as getting future promotion and joining in condemning the worker rising up is a good way to earn brownie points.

Like FFS, we barely earn enough as it is with the minimum wage to survive and everywhere we go we're treated as disposable goods with manager harrying us to work faster and faster till we're too sick to come in to work then its no longer their issue. Not to mention often times when someone is unavailable they simply YEET you over to that position without any training, causing injury and slowdown which they blame on YOU.

Also, REALLY? 1 HOUR UNPAID LUNCH BREAK? I bust my back to work and yet its fine to not pay me for lunch when its WORK RELATED. Wake up maintaining the house to paying rent so we can go to work, getting transportation to get to work, sleeping to get to work, rest day to ensure our little cogs continue spinning at work. AND YET somehow lunch is not considered a pivotal part of it all and we're forced into a 9 hour work shift instead of 8 like any other country claiming to be a developed one.

178,Should I take ACCA in this case?,dgv2oz,2019-10-12 13:21:02,"**Not posting to** r/accounting **as virtually everyone over there is not Malaysian.**

So I am an accounting degree graduate from a recognized local university under 1st Schedule of Accountants Act 1967, which means that I can automatically be admitted as a member of MIA and become chartered accountant in Malaysia without taking any examination, after 3 yrs of working experiences.  


However, in my workplace (a mid-tier audit firm), most of my colleagues are taking ACCA (and few CPA Aus) even though they are of same background as me (having a recognized degree by MIA). At 1st I thought they are sponsored by firm so they take ACCA with a casual mindset (it's free anyway) but soon, I found out that this was not true - most of them are actually paying out of own pocket.  


I feel like I am lagging behind of my peers/colleagues. Everytime listening them talking about ACCA really makes me worry about my own future and puts me into anxiety. Feels like I am a failure and just a lazy and unmotivated guy.  


You may call me kiasu. But in a chinese-majority environment (audit firm), you tend to be affected by them.  


Some CFO and audit partners (other firms) that I know due to family and friends connection have always been telling me since when I am in uni, that as long as I got MIA membership, it's good enough in Malaysia, unless I am planning to migrate. I do not intend to migrate.  


Coupled by the fact that some of my managers or even my partners does not have ACCA and only has MIA, it really puts me into a dilemma - should I just leave it as it is and wait for my MIA membership, or should I get my ass off and start taking ACCA part time?  


**So my main question is : Is ACCA really that necessary if I already have MIA membership? Is the hardwork, the money spent, the time sacrificed, worthwhile for me?**  


I have 2 issues hindering me as well:  


1) I come from a relatively poor family. Would be a burden for me to fork out for ACCA exam fees + course materials + classes. Study bond? Well, 1st of all it is not automatically given to every staffs (need recommendation from manager) and 2nd, if I break the bond got additional penalties, which might hinder me from seeking other great opportunities as the bond is 4 years. That's why most staffs don't have study bond with the firm.  


2) My parents are both already old (around 60 yrs old). Their health condition is also getting worse. Life as an auditor is already busy enough. If I were to take ACCA, there would be almost no time for me to accompany them as free time = ACCA preparation. Annual leave? Also used for ACCA preparation / exams. Man.......  


Oh yeah, in case any of you ask, how about CPA Aus? Open book, MCQs, easier right? But too expensive = exam fees and subscription fees alone costs 20k+. Not including study materials and classes. Price tag for same scenario in ACCA is only RM 8k+-. Plus, it seems like it's considered to be inferior as well......",,12,0.86

For my final year project in college I will be doing a campaign called Unashamed aimed to tackle the stigma surrounding sexual violence. Due to the stigma surrounding sexual assault cases, victims are deterred from speaking up about their experiences and reporting it to the authorities. I created a Google form for people to anonymously send in ‘Open Letters to Society’, to talk about why they’ve never told anyone about their experiences before and what they wish people would do in the future when they hear about it instead of reacting negatively and blaming them for it. I hope this will make people understand victims better and learn to have more empathy and sympathy for them.

Here’s the link! I will be putting up some submissions at my exhibition booth, if you are alright with that. All submissions are ANONYMOUS. :)

All the abuse I've suffered during my teen years has finally taken it's toll on me. Eventhough we're already on good terms, I could not shrug off the hate. It just gets worst whenever I'm alone. The thoughts just keeps repeating. 'They've destroyed my high school years so why should I be nice to them?'. Other than that I'm also suffering some sort of narcolepsy. But it comes and goes. And the symptoms is not too extreme. Once fell off my motorcyle on my way home from work because I was microsleeping lol but that's it. I'm guessing this has to do my mental state because since I was in my teen years, no matter how much sleep I get, I'll always get tired comes noon. And some nights I'm gonna be asleep by 9 and some nights I'm not gonna be able to sleep at all. I'm pursuing my degree next year, so I really need to have myself mentally fixed before that. I've finally got the balls to meet and speak with a psychiatrist. The problem is that I'm broke. And all the psychiatrist around me were privates so I'm expecting the treatments gonna be pricey. I've read about goverments psychiatrist but I can't seem to know where are they located. Oh I lived in Setiawangsa,KL. And please tell me about the procedure. Thank you!",,15,0.9

208,Why can Muslims in Malaysia celebrate Halloween with no problem but if they celebrate Christmas there is a problem?,dgkpfy,2019-10-11 20:20:50,"From Wikipedia:


Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of Hallows' Even or Hallows' Evening), also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve, is a celebration observed in several countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed. 

It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain; that such festivals may have had pagan roots; and that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church. Some believe, however, that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, separate from ancient festivals like Samhain.",,0,0.48
209,Our perspective on China,dgkjyd,2019-10-11 20:09:41,"Recently China celebrated their 70th anniversary of their communist regime. They had a grand parade with floats brandishing the hammer and sickle. I watched this event unfold on the Chinese Global Television Network (CGTN) channel on Astro. It made me wonder. Is communism cool now?

Astro won an award or something so they gave access to all channels for 2 weeks for free and I got to watch some CNN and BBC and I'm surprised that they had entire time slots dedicated on covering the Hong Kong protests (which never gets shown on CGTN). Even going as far as showing a drone footage of the Chinese Muslims concentration camps prisoners being tied up. I was amazed at how detailed their reports were. Well ofcourse with a dash of ""China Bad"" vibes. It is the western media after all. 

Then I switched to our domestic channels. RTM1,2, TV3, Awani etc. Some of them gave updates on the protests in Hong Kong. Most of them set the narrative that the protestors were attacking the the police and that (((they))) were the bad guys. Almost never mentioning them getting shot with live bullets or losing an eye (pepehands). Surprisingly even the politicians are quiet about it.  No support nor criticism. They just turn on a blind eye on the Chinese atrocities. Which brings me to question. Do we actually support the communists now? Inb4 50cent shills nuking this thread.",,9,0.63

This is the second Budget that comes from Pakatan Harapan for the year 2020. As Vision 2020 has been postponed, I personally would like to how the government would spend for:

1. Visit Malaysia Year 2020

2. 4th Industrial Revolution 

3. TVET

In line with 2019's budget slogan of '**Malaysia Wibawa, Ekonomi Dinamik, Rakyat Sejahtera**', the people would like to see what socioeconomic programs would be rolled out to:

1. Reduce cost of living

2. Help the poor

3. How health and education sectors would be improved

4. Improve the quality of life

5. If new taxes would be introduced

For economists, they probably would like to see:

1. Rate of inflation

2. If the budget could achieve the deficit target

3. The national debt

4. How much is the FDI

5. If Malaysia has improved in the Corruption Perspective Index (CPI)

6. The government's spending to stimulate the economy

7. How the budget would lessen the impact of trade war on our economy

Do you inherit as an offspring from your parents or/and do you have to be a malay citizen to get stuff? 

Cause I'm malay and I live for years in Germany. Thats why I want to give up my malay citizenship for a german (cause I wont be going back to Malaysia, my life is here now so it makes sense right)

But my mom told me that someone who gives up their malay citizenship cant inherit even though they're an offspring. 

Is this really true? Anyone can fill me in about this?

This is gonna be a long post about the possibility to return to Malaysia with a foreign husband and child. 

A little background :

I currently live in the country of my husband  with our child, in Europe. Pros here is that, he earns good money in IT, it’s rather safe here and has good healthcare. But, our social life is bad. For example, if we were to die in our apartment on Friday night, no one would know or come looking for us till probably Tuesday as his boss would probably look for him. We’ve practically got no friends, family on his side is broken up and have not too much contact (possible to go 2-3 months without any contact). People of his country are very reserved and not friendly at all. Expats here have their cliques and I don’t live to near to other Malaysians. I’m so lonely here and have started to resent living here. In the long run, I don’t think it’s mentally healthy for us to live here and I don’t want my child growing up without a life. 

Then I started thinking of returning to Malaysia. But I left Malaysia 10 years ago, things have obviously changed. In my mind, life in Malaysia will be balanced (or at least not too big of a gap) between social life and working life. We will earn less and have less security, but we’d have a better social life and overall happiness will increase. Heck, jus true thought of it makes my stomach flutter (or maybe I’m just thinking of my favourite Teh Ais and roti banjir tambah sambal). 

Am I being naïve here to think that? I’ve never held down a full time job in Malaysia for more than a year - worked full time for half a year before studying, don’t know how much income taxes we’d have to pay as I don’t think I contributed to any before, my child will stick out like a sore thumb in government school (international school will be too expensive, private is considerable), and of course the part where I don’t have rights as a Malaysian woman to enable my husband to get a PR automatically or so and citizenship for my child. 

The original plan was to stay here till kiddo is done with school and then we retire in Malaysia. But I really feel here that money can’t buy happiness, and that the loneliness will consume me before I retire back home.",,26,0.83

I'm traveling to Malaysia in 2 weeks and wanted to clarify the best options for traveling between KL / JB and Singapore.

I'll be landing in KL airport and will be staying there for a while. After a few days, I will be going to Singapore and was wondering **what the best method / bus company to travel with to get there?** 

From Singapore (Novena), I'll be heading to JB. What would you recommend to go from SG to JB? Google Maps shows some bus routes but **I was wondering if there were any bus companies that take you from SG (Novena area) to JB?** 

Lastly, I'll be going back to KL from JB. I **Any recommendations or buses to go back to KL would be welcomed.**

He's going to be coming over in the near future and we're hoping he could stay at my apartment with me instead of getting a room at a 4 or 5-star hotel, as is the usual advice when trying to avoid the professional cockblockers.

* I live in Selangor. Petaling district.
* My apartment has a security guard at the lobby. Everyone passes through there to get in. I'm worried the guard(s) might become an informant. Among the guards rotating shift at that lobby is a talkative Malay woman with tudung. I'm judging purely from the fact she wears tudung that she gon be a snitch.
* An acquaintance says I'm overthinking. Apparently khalwat raids don't happen in Selangor anymore? Really?
* Edited to add: I am free-hair and don't look Malay. I am half-Chinese and can usually pass as banana Chinese until I give my name (very Arabic name) or show my IC card.

If there's enough risk, we're not going to hang out in Malaysia. I don't know if this is a weird question to ask here, but I really don't have anyone else to turn to. Thanks in advance, monyets. I will answer any questions with as little vagueness as I possibly could.",,3,0.62

Question | Answer
:-- | :--
Aren't board games kind of lame? | Board games have experienced a [renaissance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/25/board-games-internet-playstation-xbox) since the Monopoly and Scrabble you might have played as a kid. They're more like couch co-op video games now!
Is this beginner friendly? | Totally! Every game gets explained to the group before starting. A few new players come for every session and have a great time!
What games will we be playing? | The board game cafe has a huge library to choose from; check out their FB page for photos. The cafe staff have been quite good at recommending fun games as well.
How do we get in touch on the night? | PM me your number if you'd like to be added to the WhatsApp group.
Can I BYO? | The venue has asked that we don't bring our own food, drink or board games.
Is there dinner beforehand? | We're leaving it to the group to self-organise on this as it's hard to coordinate the whole group plus a big booking etc.
How many people attend? | We generally have 12-24 people per session. Attendance varies widely and it's hard to predict!
Why are these posted so early? It's noisy. | No choice unfortunately - we need to post early so the Upcoming Events list in the daily thread can point to it. You're welcome to downvote to get it off the frontpage.",,26,0.93

Like, what to do in KL or around the country, any tips on what to or not to do, any recommendations on what to bring and idk any other thing you would like to tell me!  


More in depth, I'm an ESL teacher who got a job offer in KL to teach english and I plan on living in KL for at least 2 years probably more tho! I'm a Mexican guy who's been living in Toronto, Canada for the past 5-6 years and so what I was told is that KL is like Toronto, the most culturally diverse city in South East Asia just like TO is for NA; I'll be moving in March/April with my girlfriend to an apartment in the I-City in Shah Alam.  


I'm just curious to know what awaits me, have any of you been to the I-city? How's it like? I see it's very pretty and colorful! Is any of you from there too? I'm also curious about how's night life? Is it safe to go out to a bar at nights? How far away am I from downtown/KLCC towers? Is it worth getting a car? or how's public transport vs using uber? How much should I expect to spend in utilites (wifi, electricity, water, gas)?  


As for things outside, what's there to do?! I know there's a cave nearby and a zoo! but outside the city, are there any beaches? How far away am I from Singapore?

461,legal advice needed concerning a 20 year old student planning to leave controlling parents,ddof4w,2019-10-05 15:09:20,"As the title suggests, I am in need of legal advice as a Malaysian living in Malaysia. I am a 20 year old student, female, muslim currently studying in university under my parents financial support and I plan to leave my controlling parents. I am in fear upon graduating, I will be forced to stay with my parents with or without a job. I am at the point where I'm not even sure if I can even have the power as an adult to choose who I marry. I live with conservative, asian tiger parents and who are extreme in their religious belief (note that I hope that I've depicted the true scenario of my parents in the most accurate way without misrepresenting them). Please note that the questions i will ask will be in the scenario where a person my age is financially independent. My question is:  
1. Would it be considered as 'running away' if you decide to suddenly leave from your parents' house if you're above legal age (18+) here in Malaysia?   
2. In the event where parents of the adult child reports this case to the police station as 'missing child case' because he/she left the parent's house for good without their acknowledgement, will actions be taken by the police to do something about it?  
3. In the event where the adult is found by the parents and faces physical harassment by parents & parents are using physical force to make the adult return to live with the parents, what should the adult child do? Are the parents themselves breaking any law? Can the adult child in this case report the act to the police?   
4. If the adult child chooses to leave the country by their own free will upon a job offer or for marriage purposes, will there be any involvement of their parents?

491,Need some administrative advice on running my biz,ddhzqj,2019-10-05 03:31:24,"Earlier this year, I started a Sdn Bhd with a partner. We have zero experience in running a business but I believe we are quite familiar with the industry we are in. So, for the past few months, we had been focussed on getting the businesses (marketing), delivery of services and collecting funds.

Now that things are more settled down, we are slowly sorting out the paperwork including start paying ourselves salaries (we have no other full-time staff). We have appointed companies to do company secretarial work, tax, including bookkeeping, and an auditor. 

I have just sorted out EPF (using the portal, we were able to make contributions for employer and employee) and is in the midst of sorting out Socso. The tax guy said he'd assist in making PCB deductions for the Oct salaries.

We are a small outfit and have no plans to hire an admin staff. Any suggestions on how to put in place a system to get our affairs in order eg make sure receipts, invoices are filed properly, etc Although, being a small outfit, we do not have that many transactions, we still need to keep things in order. I want to avoid last-minute scrambling to get things in order.

Right now, our receipts, invoices are all over the place. For now, I think I can still recall the nature of each of our banking transaction based on the monthly statement eg this money in is from Client A, this money out is for Vendor B. But as time goes by and transaction volume increase (hopefully!), such things bound to slip my memory.

My tax / bookeeping guy has given me an Excel template for Cashflow and Petty Cash. And he's has advised us to keep the invoices and paste all the receipts on a piece of paper. These sound so overwhelming.... considering we are still new and are busy generating revenue... and collection.

Also, I was told that there's some free software / online HR services to do stuff like generate payslip etc. Any idea what they are?

I'd prefer online / digital solutions eg can I scan my receipts / invoices and store them in cloud? I do most of the admin work but I also want my partner to be kept in the loop for transparency sake. What's a good system to do so? If there are freelancers who can assist in this (and not so expensive), I don't mind paying.

Any advice much appreciated! Thanks in advance.",,13,0.88

So I have an idea, since there are many users out there why not start a study about it? The basic objective of the study is the effect on every different type of people, healthy or not for its short term and long term use, of course conditions and regulations must be implemented to the subjects for the study, but for me personally it'd help a lot of people being able to ingest marijuana without facing the risk of getting caught or worse.  
Plus I see that most of the weed we have here are low grade indicas, limiting to the type of marijuana used and risk of spiked weed. Sativa or any known strains are premium prices here, ridiculous rates controlled by gangs and such  
Lawyers, doctors, mental health professionals, politicians, educators of this subreddit anyone willing to team up for this study?

&#x200B;

I am planning to interview several local performers that frequently have gigs at [Suzie Wong](https://suziewong.asia). After some research on their past interviews, I realized those interviews were sort of basic. So I wanted to be a bit different and have a section around ""what the public wants to know"" (title pending). Maybe I've been watching too much ""Web's most searched questions""... Anyway, I think it's pretty cool and fun to involve the public with our local talents.

It's still in the planning phase, but hopefully, the first interview will be done, written, and posted by the end of the month. But yeah...

If you're a **singer, a performer, a band, a DJ,** or are **just really curious about the local scene**, what would you like to ask these performers? Leave it in the comments!

&#x200B;

Side note 1: Would you guys want me to show the list of performers here? The internet has thought me to... second guess myself before doing something...

Any advice and/or questions on how I can improve on this are also appreciated!

&#x200B;

Edit 1: So some of the questions I have prepared from my side (in no particular order) are

\- What sort of music genre would you like to hear more of; be it in the local scene or international mainstream?  
\- Are there any big problems in the local music scene that you think can be improved? How would you do so?  
\- Could you tell us about 5 newcomers we should be looking out for in our local scene?  
\- What were some of the struggles you went through when first breaking into the scene, and how did you overcome them?  
\- What industry advice would you give to people trying to get into the scene?  
\- In your opinion, what are 5 essential skills that a performer/musician/DJ needs?  
\- How were your first few years in the scene? And what were the lessons you learned quickly?  
\- Could you tell us about how your day-to-day lives are?  
\- Are there places where you and other local artists meetup? Would you mind sharing?

Questions are not finalized, and some questions may be similar to one another.",,4,0.74

&#x200B;

The first time I was new to the Condo and their access cards had a problem of which they stopped to work, so I informed the security that I am a resident but since the access cards wouldn’t work that I need to have a visitor paper.   
So I put the visitor paper on the front and parked at the visitor parking as supposed to be, but that also didn’t help and they just clamped the car although I explained the matter!!

The second time, I have parked by mistake at a different level.

In both cases, the security/management have not contacted/informed me to move my car before they clamp it although they usually do it with other visitors/residents, and although they know how to reach me and they have all my info in their system. I  was just SHOCKED because their humanity didn't help to respond no matter how much I tried to explain to them!!!

Also, one day they have given our unit a false notice, of which they asked us to move our cars to a very far spot for 4 days in order to paint the parking, but after the 4 days they have painted Nothing and my parents and me had a painful time walking to reach the car during that period.   
And although I explained to them how hard to us to move the car away because my mum and dad are disabled, they have never responded...! 

That doesn’t feel right/fair and we don’t feel safe in our own building! And we haven’t signed an agreement on these high fees indeed too or any of their stupid rules they set by themselves. They make a lot of money by offending us!! 

So I am wondering; are these actions eligible for a Police engagement? or what are the options to stop such offensive behaviors / who to contact in order to help in solving this issue?

I mean it's not like there's only one household and I can talk to the person. There are four households. And the family which has 3 dogs is not the most friendly household in the world.

654,Malaysians and Body Image,dbatyy,2019-09-30 12:29:57,"I just read a rather interesting article about a Malaysian influencer who posted on her Insta stories that any girl above size M is “as sinful as obesity” and that they should “pls, stop eating and move your ass to the gym already” and be a size 2/XXS just as she is. While most people would probably laugh it off as this being another attention seeking influencer, I think that this is rather dangerous behaviour. Just thought I’d share about this personal family issue that happened a couple of months ago. 

I think as Asians (at least those who aren’t small, skinny or petite) you are probably quite accustomed to public comments on your body size by your family or relatives. Most of us know how to pay no mind or laugh it off. Body shaming is quite a thing here (recently there was a host on tv who was publicly shamed by one of the judges). Getting open comments on your body has always been regarded as a very Asian thing. 

But I got a bit of a wake up call last year when my young cousin who just turned 15 was rushed to the hospital. She had developed anorexia and had dropped all the way to 28kg for her 168cm frame. Her parents were in denial at first, claiming that she was simply “not hungry” and that anorexia was something only Westerners experiences. I can’t really blame them for being misinformed as this was something completely foreign to them. It took a very stern doctor to tell them that this was the worst case he had seen in his career and that if she drops any lower, she would definitely die, with a high risk of a heart arrest. 

It was really sad to see how such a bright and cheerful young girl was reduced to a shell of her formal self, obsessing over food, only insisting on having a bowl of oats a day. She would hide food that the hospital provided all over the room— under her bed, behind the cupboard. She was just skin and bones, like those starving children in war torn countries that you see in the news, and internally, she was in bad shape. Despite being only 15 (it turned out her disorder had been going on for a few years), she had stopped getting any periods for 2 years. That just a few of the ton of health issues that the doctors diagnosed her with. 

The reason why she became like this? Two reasons: 1, bullying from her peers in school who would always taunt her for being fat and ugly. She was not fat. She only had some baby fat on her cheeks and tummy as any healthy teen would but was definitely a healthy size. Even in the hospital, her phone was constantly buzzing with mean comments from her so-called friends. We tried taking her phone away from her but that’s like trying to tear a limb away. In the end, doctor had to confiscate it and only allow an hour a day. Even that was a struggle. 

2, influencers. An obsession of wanting to look like her “idol influencers”. Being a lot older, I don’t get how anyone could be so influenced by social media, but for the young ones, this is their reality. 

The other sad and shocking (to me) thing was that when I first visited her in the psychiatric ward, it wasn’t  crazy, old people that were mostly there. It was actually crowded with very young teenagers. So many with depression, suicidal thoughts and body disorders. The doctors told us that the number of young Malaysians checking into the ward for bulimia and anorexia has incredibly increased over the years thanks to social media, and they’re getting so much younger. Even 11 or 12 year olds are getting sent to the psychiatric ward for this issue. And it’s not just girls, both genders are equally affected.  

What I’m trying to get at here is that, I think there needs to be accountability and sensitivity in matters like this. For many of us, it is a laughing matter but for many young ones, there is a lot of hurt behind their smiles and they end up in such extreme measures. Being healthy is of course great and everyone should take care of themselves but this obsession with looks and size is problematic. I think down the road, schools should take notice of issues like this that are affecting more and more young ones who are just so impressionable. When my cousin’s parents went to the school to report about her bullies, the school laughed it off, called them sensitive and that “kids are just being kids”. 

She’s finally out of the ward but still has to meet her psychiatrist on a weekly basis. Is on all sorts of medication and mood stabilisers, definitely not the way a 15 year old should be living. She has good days, some relapsed days. The journey to recovery is a long and arduous one.",,22,0.83

657,So..... What is wrong with our higher education system?,dbad8a,2019-09-30 11:49:50,"Back story, I am a Malaysian born in Malaysia. At the young age of 11,  I went overseas with my dad. Where ever he moves, I will follow along while studying. I eventually graduated from an international school overseas. The Certificate that I obtained from the school was called ""American High School Diploma"".  After I graduated I came back and attended the national service since I was called on for some reason. and decided to study here for a bachelor degree. Eventually graduated and now seeking for universities for my masters.

Due to this,  I do not have UPSR all the way until SPM. 

So today I decided to call up two different public uni asking for their master's degree. Explained to them my situation. 

Uni #1: told me that they will get back to me. Then proceed on saying they can't give me an answer now since they will have to discuss with their admission committee and that they can only review my qualification when the application date is open. Since I am a Malaysian nationality without SPM, they cannot accept me simply. 

Uni #2: tole me that they will get back to me. An hour later dropped me an email saying 

>Salam Sejahtera   
>  
>Perbualan telefon kita sebentar tadi adalah dirujuk.  
>  
>Mohon ambil maklum bahawa calon perlu ada kelulusan SPM untuk memohon Sarjana Sains Kaunseling.  
>  
>Terima kasih.

I don't get it. why is it that I am applying for a masters degree course but they require me to have SPM when I already have a degree in the related field, above average cgpa, and accredited by MQA? So ALL Malaysian has to have SPM to be able to attend public university? What rule kind of bullshit is that? 

I am half ranting half trying to ask for solution for my case. Please don't give me the advice of taking SPM now. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Public Universities not even willing to review my accreditation because I don't have SPM.",,17,0.79

So I'm planning to shot a short film. Low budget with me doing most of the work including financing. I've decided to hire a friend who is willing to act in it for payment.

My problem is that I want to sign a contract with him but I'm unsure of where to get a contract drafted to hire an actor for short film.

Can anyone give me any advice? Is there anything online that I can just use or does Malaysia have some specific papers for this situation?",,6,0.81

Correct me if I’m wrong or for any misconceptions, but off the tops of my head are:

* Malaysians need to look pass religion, ethnicity/race and be open-minded
* Muslim Malaysians should be able to convert to different religion without a fuss. This I believe is why we’re so divided.
* 62 years and we still make religion a big issue

Eg: I kata yang you ni tak fair
(I said that you are not fair)

In my opinion, It kinda bugs me that it is getting more common and don’t get me started on the malaysian malay dramas we watch. I wouldnt even consider it a malay drama if they are using wayy too many english words in their conversation. 
Personally, I don’t have any qualms using aku /kau or saye/awak in conversations.
I’m no language purist and I’m not a malaysian malay (Im  Singaporean Malay) so I’m just wondering what are your thoughts on this and does it mean that the prestige of the Malay language is eroding?

Edit: I’m not complaining, I’m very certain that singaporan malay use you and i frequently and I’m more curious as to why it’s more common. Im not too sure which subreddit to post and this is for people mainly interested in the language and less about the political and demographic nature of Malaysia and Singapore. Sekian.",,23,0.87

Upon collecting my pizza, I was interrogated by the police (commercial crime investigation unit) as to how I manage to complete my order. Dominos claimed that the order wouldn't have been able to be processed without a minimum paid order unless I was using some sort of 3rd party tool or hacking. Sure enough, upon demonstrating my usual method of order online, it couldn't go through at the payment page. I told them its possible that their system received the report from the branch manager (the one who made the police report) and immediately amended the new limitation in place. How did I prove this? Well, all I had to do was to show them a few other bugs and weakness in their system that they themselves never noticed. The 1-hour long interrogation eventually ended with the police siding to my explanation and adviced that Dominos themselves should first investigate the case internally before reporting it to the authorities. Hence, the blame now shifts to Dominos Malaysia for losing 1 customer just to save some small change. The police were very professional and courteous throughout the ordeal, but eventually it struck me a few hours later that I could've been arrested and spent the night in jail that day. Congratulations, to Dominos Malaysia for treating your customer like a criminal.

I've decided to share it here in case anyone else is thinking of embarking/has embarked on on similar journey as well and can share tips.   
Context is that for most of my life, I've been an obese man (BMI 31-32), and always felt judged by my social circles for my weight even if they didn't say it out loud.  

My ex-girlfriend was weighs less than me, but I think she also belongs in the overweight category. While we were together, we avoid physical activity (our couple activity was Netflix or Steam games) so we only grew heavier together.   

I'm thinking positively and hoping that I can date someone more sporty in the future. To that end, I've decided to get out more and also manage my body image. I calculated my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) to be 1,940, and my Average Daily Calorie Need is 2,328.01. You can calculate your requirements here: [https://www.greateasternlife.com/my/en/personal-insurance/live-great/live-great-tools/weight-management-tools/daily-calorie-needs-calculator.html](https://www.greateasternlife.com/my/en/personal-insurance/live-great/live-great-tools/weight-management-tools/daily-calorie-needs-calculator.html)  

The 1-main-dish diet that I am trying to stick to looks like this: \[Breakfast\] Nasi Lemak (w/o fried chicken) = 644   \[Lunch\] Wantan Mee = 411 \[Dinner\] Bun (Kaya, Chicken Curry) = 220 Total = 1,275 calories I use this as my guide: [https://raaga.my/trending/hot-stuff/malaysian-food](https://raaga.my/trending/hot-stuff/malaysian-food)     
I work in a rather large office with many colleagues, and we often go for lunch. I hope they don't keep tempting me... I so far managed to to keep to my 1-main dish

As for exercise, I am running endurance every evening 5km without fail. So far I maintained it for 4 days. I am considering Fitbits to help me keep track of the calorie burnt, but not sure which model to get or the considerations. Recommendations welcome.  

So this is what I am doing now. It is not easy, because sometimes I want to eat differently, but there are not many healthy options. Sometimes I have evening appointment and only run very late before sleep. I am grateful if there are tips on how to sustain or lose weight faster that anyone can share.    

But meanwhile, I hope everyone has a great weekend ahead and achieve their daily (weight loss) goals.",,37,0.85

Throughout my time there as a child, and teenager, my Malay cousins would always tell ghost stories and say them with such conviction, that I feel he actually believed in them. Not to mention we had numerous weird things happen to us one particular year, when we travelled up north in the country. My dad (about as English as you get) has always been cynical, and I guess it massively rubbed off on me too. So with all the weird and wonderful things that took place that holiday, we would often laugh or put it down to something else. My mum and cousin, on the other hand, firmly believes it was some sort of spirit or black-magic occurrence.

It's not just my own anecdotal experience that leads me to believe (some/many) malays are superstitious of things, but also  a lot of dramas on TV seem to be based around ghost stories, or similar super natural things.

Whenever I go back home, in the UK, to see my family. My mum will be watching some supernatural Malay drama that she's found on the internet - I wonder if it's the media consumption or something more deep-rooted in Malay society/history?

Just a random funny story, when I was in Malaysia for my honeymoon back in 2016, we were visiting family in KL. One evening one of the doors shut on its own (it was windy outside, so my explanation was it was a draught of wind), instead of pointing to the obvious I shouted ""Oooo, must be a Pontianak!!"", I have never seen a room of people look so scared. I was told I shouldn't have said that. Everyone except me and my dad were on edge afterwards. Ha.

Are you superstitious? If so, where do you think it has come from? If not, why not?",,11,0.78

868,The issue of statelessness and gender discrimination in Malaysia,d9c6bu,2019-09-26 00:40:40,"    I was at a DHRRA (a volunteer organization dedicated to human development) workshop being held in Penang to help people understand the issue of statelessness last month. I was surprised to learnt that the fundamental reason behind statelessness is because of gender discrimination practiced by JPN (Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara).

    One of the lawyers showed us some slides and pointed out the that it was because of some obscurity in the federal constitution or the Perlembagaan, specifically article 15a of the special citizenship, that causes JPN to misinterpret it as to allow woman to have upper power in citizenship rights. Specifically, if the case is of a child born before a marriage registration, the child is deemed illegitimate in the eyes of the law. If both the parents are Malaysian, then obviously child is gonna be Malaysian albeit with some penalty incur for late registration. The problem is if the father is foreigner and mother is Malaysian, the child is automatically entitled to citizenship, but the inverse is not true, which is if the father is Malaysia mother is foreigner, then your child is not automatically entitled to citizenship. Which force the child into a legal limbo and is not a fun one either.

    Let's face it, this issue is lacking in awareness and not heard among the general public partly due to its unimportance/unurgency. The average person does not know of this problem, but everyone is prone to cause it. I can't tell you how many times people are surprised when I say I have no IC. Yes! I am Stateless and 18 years old and it's very frustrating to settle for less while being influenced by the progressive attitude of my peers to the point of mental illness, some are even contemplating suicide. 

    The causes of statelessness are parent's irresponsiblility, parent's illiteracy and many more minor factors like lack of infrastructure in the case of Sabahan/Sarawakian. In Malaysia, if this problem hit you, then you are done for good. Is it really fair that even if the parent is at fault, they have no other way to make up for it. Through my experience, if you ever get hit by this problem then it's beyond your control even the finest lawyers can't save you, because our laws are discriminatory anyway. The statelessness issue is a political card used by politician to look good in the news when they finally granted some people which in theory should be entitled to citizenship at the first place! 

    Don't get me to talk about adopting orphans too! Because the law currently stands to discourage adoption of orphans as the adopter has to go through lengthy legal process to get approved by JPN for adoption. And the legal time limit for registering for it is too short as JPN can take a very long time to reply, so adopters usually miss the time limit (this also applies to biological parents registering for child/illegitimate child). Want to know why Malaysia is so unprofessional? Look at JPN! You think adopting orphans is a charitable cause? Think again in bolehland!

    Gender discrimination is really a big issue in Malaysia as opposed to the trivial ones in USA, in my opinion no offence. The statelessness issues can bring lots of disadvantes to the child, it's like the child being OKU without being OKU. Any opportunities you can think of eg employment, health, scholarship, schooling, sponsorship, driving license, banking, you name it! Even applying for a rapid card or going into some location like redbox will be limited to the stateless child. And the limited opportunities are just one in a crap ton of problems for the stateless like mental instability and psychological problems caused by the trauma. I cannot tell you how many times my argument with my mum is about this stupid IC issue! 

    The point of this post is to spread awareness about the gender discrimination and statelessness issue in Malaysia. And also to help in preventing would be parents/adopters from having to stuck in this frustrating and costly legal limbo for decades to come and even then it is not guaranteed it will be solved. 

Tl:dr - Malaysia citizenship law written in constitution is misinterpreted by JPN due to some obscurity in article 15a. And through JPN inefficient procedure it creates problem for parents/adopters who misses the time frame for registration especially illegitimate child and late marriage registration case, which is often if you are not considered a ""normal"" case, because of the long response time from JPN and their slow work pace. So beware fellow Malaysians and redditors

More about me (emotional rant) :
Have you ever had a crush on someone out of your league, and knowing that you are not good enough for her, but then you realize it's your fault for not being good enough, and you want to try improving your self esteem/confidence and generally every aspect of your life in the hope that maybe one day you can get her? Ya that's me in a nutshell right now, just a normal 18 year old. Throughout high school I am shy, cold, poor etc. And I wanna make up for the lost time and opportunity by learning investment, new skills generally anything to get me out of this poverty shithole and improve my personality but no... JPN just don't want to give me a fuckin IC! I know there are some that are worse off than me and I am grateful for that but still I am worse than my average peer right now. I am fortunate to be able to get into form 6 but I quitted because of the pressure. I am confident I can handle the syllabus but my life is a mess and it's hindering my performance but I can't do shit about it partly because of IC problem and mental issue right now. I can't stand the thought of people progressing in life while I stagnated. I even get a sense of strong jealousy everytime I see people so I call it quit and stay in my room everyday, close all contacts including social media while playing my Xbox 360 and PC games, daydreaming, jacking off to the girl I never had the balls to go after, generally being a loser! At least from those I can get a sense of progression.Being in isolation is important to maintain my sanity. I sometimes think of suicide but even my balls are too scared of that 😉! If JPN is not gonna solve this issue I Ma swear I am going to blow up the HQ with the director and me ISIS style who knows? Maybe it could bring awareness to the public.",,3,0.59

I didn't order any item but my father did and the call came after a delivery man came to my house and gave a package to me. There was an automated message that tells me that there was an item not yet picked up from the Postlaju office. The automated message tells me to press ""0"" so I pressed it. After a few seconds a person answered and ask me what is the problem. I told her that I got a call concerning an item that isn't picked up yet. She asked me for the name of the receiver so I gave her my dad's name, after that she ask for my name as a receiver. After a few seconds she mentioned there is an emergency notification of some sort that tells me there was an IC being sent from Pahang to Kuching in my name but the phone number she mentioned is not mine. I've never been to Pahang and haven't been to Kuching in decades. She sounds confused when I told her that I didn't order anything and I was also surprised that the name of the deliverer is me. She asked if I ever lost an IC and I told her I did not. At the end of the conversation she told me to make a report to the police because this is concerning a private information. 

She also mentioned a phone number and an address but my dumbass was half asleep and was caught off guard when she mentioned all of this that I didn't think to write it down.

876,Air Purifier and Mask for haze season,d97rht,2019-09-25 18:55:14,"Hello Everyone ,

&#x200B;

I just want to do some sharing as right now it is haze season. 

&#x200B;

1.**N95 masks**

Do not use normal surgical mask , that won't do.  **Surgical masks** are not designed for use as particulate respirators and do not provide as much respiratory protection as an **N95 respirator.** For haze , we need to use N95 masks instead of surgical mask.

Where to get : 

Hardware shop, Pharmacy 

Lazada : [N95 mask lazada link](https://invol.co/cli0ca)  RM55 (20 Pieces) more like RM2.50 per pieces

&#x200B;

2.**Air Purifier** 

 Air conditioners can help in keeping your home cool, but an air purifier can filter out all the air pollutants and keep the indoor air clean to breathe in. Air purifier can also trap pollutants larger than 0.3 micron, such as dust mites, mould spores, pollen, pet dander and tobacco smoke. It is advisable to have at least one unit of air purifier in your house to clean all the contaminated air due to haze.

Famous brand for Air purifier are **Coway** , **Amway** and **Cuckoo** , However they are quite expensive and you need to pay monthly between MYR70 - MYR 200 for 3 -5 years commitment . There are also some other alternative from branded electrical appliance company such as sharp , Philip etc. 

While looking for an purifier on haze season , it is advisable to get one with **HEPA filter** especially with 3 in 1 features (pre filter , carbon filter and HEPA filter) that most air purifier products offer.

I will list some of them below which as per my research online for low air purifier budget with HEPA filter from Lazada :

 

[Augienb Air Purifier link](https://invol.co/cli0c3) (Cheapest you can get ) Around RM 200 after collecting coupon 

[Midea MAP-20BD Air Purifier link](https://invol.co/cli0c4)  RM322.00 (Bought this one , as it is local , arrived the next day

[Sharp FPJ30LA Plasmacluster Air Purifier link](https://invol.co/cli0c5)  RM339.00  (Hot in Lazada atm )

[SHARP JAPAN FPF40LW PLASMACLUSTER AIR PURIFIER link](https://invol.co/cli0c6)  RM599.00  (Bigger coverage with indicator )

[Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier](https://invol.co/cli0c9)  RM699 (Can link into your smartphone )

&#x200B;

BTW, I am not a seller , i am just a typical consumer sharing my knowledge from my research while looking for N95 masks and air purifier online. But , if you do purchase it online through my link i will get some coffee money due to affiliate marketing that i joined :D

&#x200B;

And I love that you could actually see in his expressions that he is actually so hungry and passionate at the things he fights for during his close facecam announcements on his social platforms! 

Not only that, YB was born into a Malaysia like you and I, a Malaysia that has already been united and independent, with all the cultures mixed and melting together forming this nation. The way he provides his greetings before each video in Malay, Chinese and Tamil languages also shows his mindset of unison and acceptance as well as embrace of other cultures. I, for one welcome his appearance in the political landscape as he best represents the values and thoughts of myself as a Malaysian young adult, and also I'm sure many of Malaysians of the same age group as me (20+, or the ""youth"") share the same sentiments, which is essentially that we do not give two damns about race or religion seggregation as much as it's made out to be and accept everyone as who they are (I mean I dont know about you but my mamak table usually has friends of all ethnicities and backgrounds)! 

I really wish to see malaysia progress into a country we all know it can be, and having more young leaders directly in parliament will allow us to be able to have people of the modern mindset make more and more of the decisions rather than (with all due respect) folks that have lived through the period of before independence and segregation that are still unfortunately running, or have ran the show with these old mentalities in mind. 

It is my hope that more and more youths will be able to join the political landscape soon, as Syed has really been a really good breath of fresh air",,0,0.44

not long ago, in a gathering with my friends, fortunately enough for me to bring up this topic, all of them has this opinion ""now if you dont side with China, surely you gg"" ""foolish for you not to side with China"" ""China is going to be the strongest, just a matter of time"" ""Hong Kong protestors seriously eat too much and have nothing to do in their spare time""

yup, namewee was right in his video

1. Kairos Coffee. The barista (Shafiq? Shafik? something like that) is an aeropress champion or something. Really friendly and enthusiastic. Sit by the brew bar and he'll gladly walk you through the brewing process or just general knowledge sharing.

2. Kohi Yatta. Barista(Karweng) is a Malaysia brewer's championship runner up iirc. Uses a slightly different technique than most barista for his pourover coffee. Price slightly higher because they use beans from overseas roaster

3. Strangers at 47. Great cafe that specialises in savoury/sweet crepes. Barista and the rest of the staffs are also very friendly and welcoming. Great food and coffee.

But first, some context: I watched a documentary""Forks Over Knives"" recently which advocated the above diet. This was based on findings by doctors and researches.

To be fair, I am not sure if it works but I am willing to give it a shot.

The thing is, like most Malaysians, I am a meat-lover and I am not sure the environment we live in makes it any easier. I live in the Klang Valley, in a Chinese-majority area. There are vegetarian shops around me, though it is quite a hassle to make my way there, while the price is a bit on the high side.

Besides, sometimes I move around for work and searching for such shops will be quite a hassle. Socially, I would think that it could be very difficult for me to stick to the diet, especially during lunch or dinner meetings. I know former Minister Liow Tiong Lai is a vegetarian and the argument went that if he can stick to it, why not us lesser mortals? But on the flip side, BECAUSE he is a Minister, people are more prepared to make concessions.

Any tips on how to do this, especially in our local context, will be most helpful eg should I go cold turkey or make a gradual transition? Thanks in advance.",,11,0.94

I'm currently living with my parents' financial support and my education qualification is only SPM level  
Due to the depression, I've lost interest in basically everything I loved doing but recently I  have managed to regain interest in gaming, its something I've done since childhood, my father told me he taught me how to play Doom95 before I learnt how to even walk. Since then, I went deep into gaming, experienced in various game types and have participated in closed betas in some AAA games. Although I do not have programming nor designing skills I have confidence in finding bugs and providing feedbacks to improve the game.  


I tried to apply as a game journalist but I lack the education certification and sadly, the local gaming magazines aren't doing very well either. Hence, I would like to know if there is any local gaming company that wants to hire a tester, I can confidently say I can provide different or better perspectives in addition I do try to learn about game engines and game designing although my major field of science has been biology. Also have experienced in mod testing for several game communities. My interest in being a pro gamer due to the reason that I do not like playing just one game within similar genre  


Like everyone, my wish is to do something that one can put his heart and soul in and gaming has been that for me. It is really my dream to be in part of a local game making company that wants to make quality wholesome games. So to everyone reading, are any of you working in such a company? I do not mind being an intern or part time whatsoever, I'm very flexible  
Hope this post is understandable anything you want to ask please feel free to do so  
The desire for me to be in the gaming industry is growing and I hope someone can help me, I lack the knowledge for the local scene. Thank you for spending your time reading this and I wish you a good day",,8,0.79
