5,Help finding a child abuse awareness video,dlf3pd,2019-10-22 08:48:28,"Hi everyone, I saw this local sponsored ad on Facebook recently and I need your help to find it again. 

It's a local video about child abuse awareness. 

This auntie is watering plants in the corridor (left hand on screen) while words appear on the right side of the screen. 

""She knows the old man upstairs has a young girlfriend.""
""She knows who had a promotion at work.""

Then there is the sound of a child crying off screen, leading the auntie to pause her watering and look up. Then she returns to her watering as the words ""but she doesn't know about the child."" or something like that. 

However, as it was a Facebook sponsored ad, I was no longer able to find it anymore. My Google-fu isn't turning up results either.

17,Does aftershock really have a good reputation for warranty claims?,dlbc5p,2019-10-22 02:33:15,"I got this aftershock PC (an expensive one, mind you) last month in september,and used it in the weekends when I did have the time to spend playing some games and doing weekend work. Its a desktop PC.

However last sunday while I was doing work on the computer there was a crackling sound from the glass of the AFTERSHOCK pc - this NZXT H500i .When I took a look at it, the glass was cracked with the spidering effect.( glass wasnt cracked when I bought it). Soon the entire glass panel shattered and the bits went to the floor.

I called aftershock for a glass replacement, but they would not let me claim warranty because they ""do not know if the glass was cracked due to manufacturing error or if I purposely broke it"" and assumed it was a user's error, claiming an addtional 50$ for the glass panel.

They also asked me to take a picture and send it to them as if the shattered glass will prove whether it is the manufacturing error or my error.

This behaviour from the support staff at AFTERSHOCK is very disasspointing. I have heard good reviews all round from reviews online and from friends, and this experience really sours the (misguided?) Trust with the company.

Should I go down to the retail store and attempt again to claim my warranty? The person on the other end claimed he was new there. Or should I hold my peace and accept the fact that I actually am the devil's incarnate and destroy my own stuff?

Pls advise.

Edit: just gave them a call, and their reply was

 ""everything is covered under the warranty, EXCEPT for the tempered glass.""

TLDR: PC just after a month use ( and only on weekends) has a defect and AFTERSHOCK does not let me claim warranty.

My grandma got hospitalised recently so for several days I've been accompanying for the entire time.

Do you feel that our local food is threatened? I know some people are interested in preserving it, but no doubt, hawker business isn't easy. Couple that with people wanting to adapt it into more unique dishes, some people are skeptical (it's like Italians and their fierce pride for Italian food)

Personally I have no issue with 'modernizing' Singapore food. Singapore food had never been 'original', it was our ancestors would adapted their home flavours to this foreign land. So long as food taste good and its worth the price, I honestly can't give a damn.

And I wouldn't mind foreigners taking over local food stores, if they're willing to preserve the dishes passed down by their hawker masters too. It's hypocritical when we we don't want to continue but Kpkb when we see PRC people cooking our food as though only we are allowed to cook our own food. 

But I really don't like the franchising of food courts under big companies, and I hope they aren't able to just own hawker centers outrightly (I don't think it's likely)

59,Job Portal Concept [Idea Feedback/Possible Implementation if viable]- For those tired of ineffective/non responsive job portals,dkuz2a,2019-10-21 04:04:47,"Good day to everyone, I have an idea I am entertaining which came to mind recently and I would like to put it out there, however, considering the fact that my target audience would initially be solely locals, I would like to get some feedback on it before actually embarking on said project.

Job searching as of today has its own problems and if things were to continue as-is, I believe we will reach a level of saturation with regards to the amount of applicants. This combined with the lack of a standardised system, will ultimately result in lower employment in areas which may actually have a good number of decent applicants.

There is no limit to who my target group is; meaning anyone from part time to full time to managerial roles are covered. (management/c suite roles will definitely require a different hiring approach but that has been taken into consideration and will definitely be given more in depth planning prior to implementation, probably late stage)

*Problems faced by:*

**Applicants**

* Lack of response from job posters/employers (waiting time of more than 1 week on average for most job portals)
* Spam from recruitment agencies (resulting in unclear job scopes that might change during the actual interview/ dissappointment due to unmet salary expectations)
* Unclear/unrealistic job description (e.g 3 years experience, ability to do build, clean and maintain a house -> Entry Level Job)
* No information on company
* Unsure of standards/reliability of company that you are applying for.
* Unable/difficult to track who has gotten back to you/not or when you previously applied for a company (some websites already do this but not all)

**Employers**

* Applicants have to be vetted (manual processes like resume/ basic questions)
* Lack of compatibility with workplace environment \*
* Unmet expectations due to the current standards of job ads (they expect way more because we don't adhere to actual advertised salary counts, we use it more like a baseline for comparison) \*

^(\* previously worked on another solution that I would be able to resolve these issues with)

I am currently drafting an idea to create a portal that would resolve these issues to a major extent, for starters, requiring both employers and applicants to reply to applications within a predefined time frame as well as setting a scoring system that accounts for companies/applicants who are applying/hiring with accordance to good practices.

Please feel free to leave suggestions if you feel there are areas which i missed (definitely have as I haven't done any surveys or anything of the sort thus far). But the main point of this post is to find out; if I built such a site and managed to convince employers/hiring mangements to post jobs, would you use it to find a job? Or do you think that existing sites already serve the purpose?

60,Why do people think Singapore is boring?,dkur1r,2019-10-21 03:44:06,"This is the common reason among my friends why they want to move out of Singapore or go overseas to study. They like to say Singapore has nothing to do, there are no interesting people and there are no interesting places to go to. 

Not being overly sentimental, but I think Singapore is fine the way it is. In fact, I love it. There are beautiful sights to catch - sunsets, skylines, nature parks etc. Have you ever tried taking a stroll in the CBD at night? It’s a very surreal experience to wander on empty streets surrounded by towering frames of glass and steel that are gently illuminated by the orange neon. I don’t think anyone can get that experience in other countries without being overwhelmed by crowded tourist traps or bright piercing lights that are a real cacophony.

And who says there aren’t interesting places to go? If one is adventurous enough to explore the more rural roads, you can find those small nuggets that are the SAF’s bases, like school of ammo in Rifle Range or ST Kinetics building in the middle of the jungle right outside the central catchment area. Gombak used to have a trekking path that cuts into MINDEF’s small hill (but sadly it closed cuz of erosion).

Also, the geography of the island. Ohhh the geography. The diamond shape is such beautiful geography. One moment you are in bukit batok, the next you are in Clementi after walking about 45 minutes. Walk further and you reach the sea. Walk along the coast and you reach Downtown. It’s homely with all the neighbourhoods nicely and conveniently situated next to each other. In any other country, there would be no limits to the urban area and sometimes, there is just a town sitting in the middle of vast hinterlands. Singapore is just like a video game map, something out of GTA.

75,Hypothesis: the average singaporean can't really empathize with Hong Kong because we've never really cared about democracy.,dkleum,2019-10-20 15:52:47,"We've never had to fight for democracy. In the 50s our fight wasn't so much pro-democracy as it was anti-colonial. As everyone knows, we didn't even want to be a country of our own, and had independence shoved upon us, after which we had to worship economic progress in order to survive. 

Hypothesis #2: we care more about economic success than democracy and civil freedoms 

So many of the comments from Singaporeans regarding HK have to do with their distaste stemming from how messy and chaotic everything has become. We've never really had to choose between order and democracy, so of course it confounds us when we see people choose to fight for democracy at the expense of order and economic stability. There's almost a sadistic snicker underlying Singaporeans' comments whenever they talk about how HK's economy is tanking because of the protests, how businesses are moving their operations and assets away from HK and into Singapore. 

Hypothesis #3: we care more about economic success within late capitalism than about democratic freedoms.

How are we supposed to understand HK's language of civil disobedience and civic participation when we've never managed to develop a vocabulary for civic participation? We tap ourselves on the back for pRagMatiC rEsiStaNce, thinking that we've developed such a uniquely Singaporean way of making our requests heard (and being okay that it takes bloody forever) because historical amnesia has been written into our DNA. Dissenters have been painted as anti-country troublemakers in our history textbooks, and we have been programmed to see protests as anti-order and therefore anti-national. Sure, we say we are a democratic nation. But we can't forget that our nation-building happened during a time where you were either democratic or broke because the West was on a campaign to snuff communism out. So embracing democracy could be seen as a way for us to align ourselves to the US and the UK and ensure that we manage to tap on their resources so that their MNCs would come and set up shop and help us industrialize and gain economic success to the dizzying rate that most of our neighbours were only able to dream of.

We've been brought up to see economic success and bureaucratic efficiency as being at the core of what it means for Singapore to be Singapore, and tbh that's just really sad. 

Not here just to make an EdGy coMmEnt so I'm really open to having these ideas challenged!

Coming straight from /r/CreditCards and I was told that most of the requirements aren't the same outside the US.

I'm Swiss citizen and I'll relocate next week to Singapore. I'll travel a lot for work and my goal is to get one of those cards:

* CSR Reserve
* Citi Prestige
* Amex Platinum

My current learning is that Singapore citizens can apply for the Citi Prestige and the Amex Platinum.

* [https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/charge-cards/platinum-card/?linknav=sg-amex-cardshop-details-browse-PlatinumCard](https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/charge-cards/platinum-card/?linknav=sg-amex-cardshop-details-browse-PlatinumCard)
* [https://www.citibank.com.sg/gcb/credit\_cards/credit-card.htm](https://www.citibank.com.sg/gcb/credit_cards/credit-card.htm)

Originally I planned to get the CSR Reserve since the benefits align best. I assume though that the CSR Reserve is not available for non US citizen in Singapore. Is that correct? I do have an employment pass and a good salary and no history with depts in credit cards (Swiss credit cards though). Am I correct that I can apply for Citi Prestige and Amex Platinum if I fulfill the requirements?

But my pet peeve is how competitiveness in Singapore unhealthily extends to outside of work/studies. For example:

Lane-cutting on the roads to overtake even though the person isn't late for work

Relatives one-upping over the other during CNY to prove that their children are better

Micro-aggressions by some Singaporeans to prove that they are right

Must be first in queuing over the latest trend for social media likes 

Holding lavish weddings and sharing them on social media to showcase wealth and probably outshine others

Hey guys! I’m hoping someone would shed some lights on this problem I’m having. I’m a design student and I’m planning to take degree right after my diploma (because I know my lazy ass will be too lazy to take it if I go out work first + plus it makes my mum happy so)

I’m studying visual communication.

So far, I’m looking at NAFA, Lasalle and SIM.

NAFA and SIM offers top up degree. (One year only)
School fees are similar (22k +, not including overseas study programme)
NAFA is affiliated to University of Central Lancashire, UK. (Which I honestly have not heard of)
SIM is affiliated to RMIT Australia.

Lasalle is 3 years. If my portfolio is good enough my diploma studies are relevant, I can be exempted from year 1 so thus 2 years.
School fees is $9730 per annum.
I’ve heard from my friends at Lasalle that the overseas programs are only for selected students.

Last but not least, NTU ADM. I’m not that confident that I’ll get in, plus it’s 3-4 years :(

I know when it comes to the design industry, it’s skills > qualifications. But since I’ll be spending my money and time doing degree, I might as well choose as good school.
I’m still my doing research on my own, but would be great if someone who went to any of these schools give some advices or what is the studies like there.

114,Why does Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin sounds similar?,dk2now,2019-10-19 11:42:50,"Aussie here learning Mandarin. There is this mystery I have wondered about for a very long time, ever since I started with Mandarin years ago. I noticed that Mandarin spoken in Taiwan and Singapore sounds exactly the same and is very different to Mandarin spoken in China.

As far as I know, no one has noticed how Singapore and Taiwanese sounds so similar. I've searched online but there was nothing about it. I've asked Chinese people about this, but they either don't know what Singapore Mandarin is like, or don't know what Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin is like. When I asked the Taiwanese, they too don't know what Singapore Mandarin is like.

Recently, I met someone from Singapore and we spoke in Mandarin. Immediately I feel like I'm speaking to a Taiwanese person. I told her that her accent sounds like Taiwanese and I have always thought that both accents sounds so similar. She said it's very actually very different, but she couldn't give an explanation. Funny enough, we at a food fair together and later she was speaking to one of the food vendors who was Chinese. They were speaking in Mandarin about the food and at one point the guy said ""...很好吃，你们台湾人喜欢的"". It was the first time I saw someone else made the connection between Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin, other than myself. So I know it isn't just me that thinks this.

Taiwan and Singapore are so far and have nothing to do with each other. China is closer to Singapore and has a way bigger population than Taiwan. Singapore Chinese people are descendants of people from China, not Taiwan. As far as I know, there wasn't any special historical or modern relationship and interactions between the two places. So why would Singapore have a similar accent to Taiwan, and not China?

157,Wildlife in Singapore; Part 49: Sunbirds,djl96f,2019-10-18 09:56:54,"Hi r/singapore, this week I'll be covering a family of birds that has several representatives in Singapore, including some that are easily encountered in urban areas - the [sunbirds](https://besgroup.org/2007/11/06/heliconias-and-sunbirds/).

There are 145 known species of sunbirds, making up the family Nectariniidae. They are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros and Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, southern China, and South and Southeast Asia, with two species found as far as New Guinea, and one species present in the Solomon Islands and northern Australia. These are small birds that possess [thin, curved bills](https://flic.kr/p/Ek6Sia). Males of many species have [colourful, iridescent plumage](https://flic.kr/p/24kgVYe), while females are [more drably coloured](https://flic.kr/p/2ffcb7y). Due to very [similar coloration](https://flic.kr/p/7DWDxL), the [females](https://flic.kr/p/oa9xSB) of [different sunbird species](https://flic.kr/p/GrLVo) can be quite challenging for novices to tell apart.

Sunbirds feed primarily [on nectar](https://besgroup.org/2012/12/12/sunbirds-sipping-nectar-from-flowers/), playing an important role in pollination. However, for some plant species, sunbirds may engage in nectar robbing, [piercing the base of the flower](https://besgroup.org/2009/01/17/olive-backed-sunbird-robbing-hibiscus-nectar/) to access the nectar, without picking up or depositing any pollen. Sunbirds supplement their diet with [insects and spiders](https://besgroup.org/2008/05/03/olive-backed-sunbird-taking-spider/), especially during nesting. Some species will consume [small fruits and seeds](https://besgroup.org/2016/11/04/brown-throated-sunbird-fruit-feeding/).

Sunbirds can be considered the African and Asian equivalent of the hummingbirds, which are endemic to the Americas. This is an example of convergent evolution, as sunbirds and hummingbirds are not closely related to each other, and are found in different parts of the world, but have independently evolved similar lifestyles. However, unlike hummingbirds, sunbirds can only [hover for short periods of time](https://besgroup.org/2016/07/27/olive-backed-sunbird-harvesting-nectar-of-firecracker-plant-russelia-equisetiformis-flower/), and usually prefer to feed while perching. Unfortunately, many people in Singapore seem unaware of the difference, and misidentify sunbirds as hummingbirds.

During the breeding season, sunbirds gather plant material, spider silk, and even [synthetic fibres](https://besgroup.org/2010/05/11/olive-backed-sunbird%e2%80%99s-blue-nest/), building a [pendant, oval, or pear-shaped nest](https://flic.kr/p/V9MwVa) with [a side entrance](https://flic.kr/p/ryofSD) that is [suspended from a thin branch](https://flic.kr/p/ehv1Vr) or twig. Two to three eggs are laid, and [the young](https://flic.kr/p/esQFxD) are fed with small insects and spiders until they fledge.

At least ten species of sunbirds have been [recorded in Singapore](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/mygreenspace/issue-41-vol-2-2019/lifestyle/recreation-and-activities/identifying-the-sunbirds-of-singapore), and I will cover them in follow-up comments.

I then said no. I questioned myself if that 20 cents meant a lot to me, then I turned around to look for that lady only to find out that someone already spared her the coins. Not long after that, she approached me again and say “I’m only asking for 20 cents, not $2000, 去死跟好” WOW i was beyond stunned ****. What’s worse was that I kind of retaliated to her and said “你去死先啦”. Also what’s worse than that is I should have just let that slide away since she’s already that old but Im just a human being who is not perfect :( I have feelings too :(

2. Took and passed a basic sports science course (ACE-RP) recently.
3. Have a diploma in Business/IT. Not too keen on continuing in IT as I find it uninteresting despite the career prospects and a place in SUSS Infocomm Tech programme which is to start next year.

Questions:

1. What do you think about the programme?
2. What should I be prepared for if I were to join the programme?
3. Do I have to further my studies after graduation? (E.g. Major/PhD)
4. (For alumni only) How easy or difficult is it to find a job in Singapore after you graduate, or do you have to live overseas to be employed? Do you like your current job?

While preparing and retrieving certain cases that are closed, I realised that the sales people are skipping a lot of the “inconvenient” steps that are put in place after past years audits.

I have managed some cases myself, and I can tell that there’s no shady shit involved, they are probably just skipping steps for the sake of being fast. These people are experienced, hence they know what they are doing.

Now the problem is... I’m supposed to clean up their cases (magically produce all the missing documents/steps, backdate them) before I pass them to the external auditor. I know this is a norm in many companies but it just feels wrong.. Should I not do them so that I won’t make myself liable for anything? &lt; and risk losing my job cause I’m still on probation :/

tldr - on probation, tasked to clean up closed cases by my sales team before sending the cases to external auditors.
_____

Edit for more clarity:

Simplified sales process-
Step 1: fact find, 
Step 2: Prepare a quote and justify why you are quoting that rate,
Step 3: client agree to the terms,
Step 4: close the case.

Now when I’m doing the audit checks, I found out that some cases are missing step 2/3. 

Superior is asking me to plug in the gaps myself but I’ve decided that I will compile a list of missing documents, approach the relevant salespeople and get them to justify the missing documents themselves.

Thanks for all the advice given! They helped me gain some clarity on what to do.",,19,0.85

I was just wondering about the following:

a) what is the main difference between full-time and part-time student? Is it just the max amount of modules per semester or is it different lecturers, class timings, etc?

b) How good are the AI classes in NUS or NTU, and is there a particular standout class or lecturer? My main interests are in recommendation systems.",,3,0.65

Father is the biggest problem, do nothing and only contribute negativity and always psycho my mom and talk shit and I have been keeping quiet all the time until I had lost it and exploded at them. So they became salty, mom stopped giving me allowance since last month. Father psycho my mom to stop paying for my phone bill and school fees too. Father even want to ruin my future and said when my school fees isn't paid, I would get expelled and mindef would call me to enlist.. wasting my 2 years in poly and not getting my diploma and getting impromptu enlistment.

Furthermore, he threatened to not give me any of their supporting documents if I were to apply for poly bursary next year. They even said it straight to my face that if I'm unhappy with them, I can move out, which is so ridiculous as I'm still a student. Is like telling me to fly when I can't even crawl?? What stupid statement is that.

I reached out to whatever help there is.. social service, school and even the court, all helpless. Even the court ownself tell me they couldn't help?!?!?? So what can I do now??

For those who wants to know some context, you can continue reading below

Things hasn't been going well ever since and it's going downhill steeply. Since my previous post, I helped my family get 2 room HDB rental. After we moved in, I'm the one doing all the work, searching for flat to view, arranging appointments, literally doing agent's work and being parent's financial planner. However, the USELESS father of mine have been so picky and still want to see what fengshui when they don't even have money to play with. Needless to say people who are poor, normal people would get what's within their means. But this useless father have the requirements of a fucking millionaire. Even give him strike million dollar lottery, no house could please him, even a freaking bungalow.

FYI, one time just cos father was nostalgic to the times when we lived in sembawang when I'm still a kid, they optioned a house there on impulse, knowing that the very first owner had loan shark case and then backed out afterwards and I was the one who got the deposit back for them. A second time when we found the perfect house at a good price and optioned it, father backed out last minute again and went mia on our agent. That point of time my mom is even against him and sick of his shit.

And now the tables have turned. Father psycho mom until they've purchased BTO. a fucking 3 room flat which I wouldn't have a room (I have 2 sis). When in the first place we could've buy 4 room and it's contradicting that parents are the ones who said not to get 3 room because it's not feasible and next time were to sell, cannot profit (LOL still want to think until there? see how ignorant they are).

What worse, if they want to buy a 3 room now, they could afford, even if it's flat that just MOP. They have fucking poor judgement. You guys can do the math. Now monthly rental is $380+ per month plus town council fee, let say $400. Having to pay $400 for the next 5 years till we get the BTO, that already $24,000. They rather spend that amount over 5 freaking years to live in a shit environment and pathetic 2 room rental flat, than to buy a 3 room flat now that can be 94 years lease left. Just because they want a brand new flat with 99 years? The BTO they bought is about $250K plus $50K levy which a total of $324K could get a good 3 room now or even a budget 4 room. Plus by that time I would be out working and can move out on my own. I need a proper home now

I did so much and rather everything for them. After using me and this is how I get treated? They don't even recognise all the shit I did for them. They even said I do nothing and only leach on all the benefits like what? One very ridiculous example is that paying singtel bill by singtel dash give an extra GB of data and father said I don't contribute to the phone bill but being a freeloader. I was even being thoughtful for them in case I exceed data.

LOL fucking end my life already. these kind of parents where to find. Seriously im fucking depressed right now. Someone just bail me out and I'm even looking for a guardian right now. Seriously what can I do? I have no control and i am powerless.. seriously i didn't ask to be born into such mess.. I already did what I could

Edit 1: To add on more. Mentioned in my previous post, father hasn't been working for as long as I could remember, even till now. He REFUSE to work. He only happened to worked part time for about 2 months recently so he could have some spare cash for himself and his 2-3 packs of cigg everyday. What's stupid is that he could've work 3 months of full time just for the sake of getting a higher loan amount to buy a decent 4 room flat. BUT HE REFUSED. It doesn't make any fucking sense and it's so contracting cos he said one reason he not want work is cos I wouldn't be eligible for bursary. FUCK SAKE. I rather have a home then having a $2k bursary one time a year.. He could give me allowances to make up for the loss of bursary. and the irony that now they are the ones preventing me from applying my bursary LOL. Just imagine how fucking poor his judgement are. Sacrificing to get a deceent home for a small $2k bursary which wouldn't mean a thing compared to a much bigger loan they could get, and now sabotaging me to not get bursary. In the end it's all lose-lose",,96,0.86

I live in a block where you can lock the shutter of your mailbox so that you don't have to deal with all sorts of random spam, but I was still having to deal with all the useless crap that SingPost would deliver to me on a frequent basis. So I called SingPost some time ago and asked them if there was a way to opt out, and there is!

I figured that opting out was a better alternative than wasting all that paper (hey, at least the ball is out of my court now) and also wasting my time grabbing all the junk just to deliver it straight to the trash.

Bear in mind that SingPost was a little draggy with my request. After I submitted the first form, they sent me an email asking for almost the exact same questions again in order to be really sure that I wanted to opt out (dot dot dot). Once the process is complete they'll stick a ""NO ADMAIL"" sticker inside your mailbox and you'll be done!

Some months have passed now since I completed the opt out process and the amount of ""noise"" in my mailbox has drastically reduced. Like I really don't get any spam anymore. This also means it's a lot less likely that I'll accidentally throw away some legitimate mail that has been stuck under a heap of junk.

301,American angmoh with a dream,di3306,2019-10-15 05:14:08,"Hey r/singapore,

I'm a university undergrad from the US about to graduate with my degree in engineering this Spring. Back in 2018, I did an exchange semester at NTU, and was thoroughly impressed with the city and country you all call home. Singapore checks all the boxes on my list regarding the urban lifestyle that I want to lead. I want to move there so badly that it is one of the only things in my life that has not diminished in interest level for 1 whole year. The only thing that is keeping me from moving from the US upon graduation is income.

I have a job in the US lined up right now that pays $110,000 SGD (per year) straight away, and then starts to quickly pay more - around $137,000 SGD 18 months after I start working there, and the pay keeps going up from there. By contrast, the particular engineering role that interests me in Singapore pays about $4000 SGD per month, or about $48,000 SGD per year, which is less than half of what I would make here in the states. I know that taxes are lower, true, but it is still significantly less money. This disparity in income is the only thing holding me back from immediately moving to Singapore.

I have a few questions:

* Is this pay of $4000/month accurate for most students coming out of university? How quickly does this income increase?
* Am I even looking at the right job? (one of my sg friends told me most engineering students go into engineering management roles since ""engineer"" means more like manual labor in Singapore... is this correct?)
* What is someone's actual income after a year? I have heard that some companies add on a bonus at the end of the year to people's paychecks. Is this true?
* How valuable is a Master's degree to Singaporean/international companies in Singapore?

What should I do? Any and all advice is super appreciated! Thanks!",,0,0.45

This one is going to be a bit esoteric, and the primary document is a 75 page legal essay that I don't think everyone is going to read. So the TDLR is:

\- Chan Sek Keong has written an article that essentially puts forward the argument that 377A is in conflict with Article 12 of the constitution

\- His argument (very briefly) is that due to changes in the law the purpose behind 377A is no longer applicable and hence there is no reasonable basis for 377A to discriminate against men. As such, 377A is not compatible with Article 12 of the constitutional (the ""equality article""). This argument is relatively novel, and was not used in the previous 377A cases.

\- This article was published yesterday, just weeks before the 377A court hearings in the High Court next month

\- The merits of the legal arguments aside, this is a pretty remarkable intervention by a former CJ, just before a case is to be heard by the Court.

&#x200B;

Summary paragraph:

*133 The conclusions and submissions of this article on the decisions of the Courts on the constitutional validity of s 377A are as follows:*

*(a) Section 377A was not intended to cover penetrative sex, that is, anal or oral sex, when it was enacted in 1938 as the same offences had already been covered by s 377 since 1872. Section 377A covers only non-penetrative sex, such as masturbation and other kinds of sexual touching and “lewd” acts.*

*(b) In so far as the Courts have decided that s 377A does not violate the fundamental rights of equality before the law and equal protection of the law on the basis that s 377A covers penetrative sex, the decisions are not binding on lower courts as being given per incuriam.*

*c) If so, it is open to an applicant or defendant in a new action or prosecution to contend that s 377A violates Art 12(1) on the ground that it unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminates against male homosexuals in respect of acts of gross indecency of a non-penetrative nature.*

*(d) If s 377A had been enacted to criminalise penetrative sex covered under s 377, it would have the effect of impliedly repealing the same offences in s 377. If s 377A had impliedly repealed those offences in s 377 in 1938, those offences criminalised by s 377A would have been impliedly repealed by s 376(1)(a) in 2007 to the extent of their inconsistency, that is, with respect to consensual penetrative sex between males.*

*(e) Under s 376(1)(a), consensual penetrative sex between males in private is no longer criminalised as an unnatural offence (because s 377 has been repealed) but is punishable under s 20 of the Minor Offences Act or s 294(a) of the Penal Code, if performed in public.*

*(f) The legislative purpose or object of s 377A determined at the time of its enactment in 1938 will always remain the same thereafter. Accordingly, the retention of s 377A by Parliament in 2007 does not affirm or reaffirm its 1938 purpose.*

*(g) Section 377A was enacted for the purpose of dealing with the mischief of male prostitution and its associate activities (which involved male homosexual conduct) which were rife in 1938, and not because male homosexual conduct was not acceptable in Singapore society in 1938.*

*(h) The purpose of s 377A as described in (g) above ceased to exist or was no longer valid in 2007 or 2013, or there was no evidence that similar conditions existed in 2007 or 2013. Accordingly, the legislative classification (or differentia) would no longer be reasonable and would not have rational relation to the purpose of s 377A (having ceased to exist). Section 377A therefore cannot satisfy the requirements of the reasonable classification test and therefore violates Art 12(1).*

*(i) Section 377A, being a pre-constitution law, cannot be declared void for unconstitutionality because Art 162 requires any existing law to be construed to conform to the Constitution. Accordingly, the court has to interpret s 377A by reading it to have a meaning that does not violate the Constitution. How s 377A should be construed (or read) to conform to the Constitution depends on the nature of its inconsistency with Art 12(1).*

*(j) If the purpose of s 377A has ceased to exist in 2007 or 2013, s 337A may be construed to conform to the Constitution by reading it as a gender-neutral provision that criminalises non-penetrative sex of gross indecency committed in public.*",,120,0.9

337,Sharing My Bariatric (Weight Loss) Surgery Journey,dhox1c,2019-10-14 10:54:50,"Long read ahead:


So I want to share some personal journey. Last Feb I went for bariatric surgery, that’s a weight loss surgery more specifically I did the gastric sleeve where they cut my stomach by 80% so I eat very little and feel super full real fast. 

For context, I am female, 36 this year and 1.68m. I was very active before, did Muay Thai and MMA but one training session some time in 2012, my back gave way and I had to stop. I did more than just stop, I completely let myself go since and gained so much weight over the years. Just before the surgery, I went in at 105kg - the heaviest I’ve ever been. I decided to do something about it and over nearly a year period of consultations, research and monitoring, I finally did the surgery. 

It wasn’t an easy journey, and there have been plenty of learnings. I want to debunk some misconceptions about weight loss surgery primarily that it is a “quick, lazy way” to lose weight because I’ve had some hard core people coming at me about it (it’s all about exercise and food!!!! they screamed at me). Some obese people have dire urgent need to lose weight quickly because of various reasons commonly diabetes or severe sleep apnea. They do not have the luxury of that 1-2 years it takes to lose weight the “natural way”. Losing weight quickly via surgery helps them to then maintain and in the support group, it’s been proven that it works as it drastically drops the % of risk in just 3 months post surgery in the case of diabetes and heart problems. In the first year post op we have dieticians working to help us develop good eating habits so that we can continue on the journey afters ourselves. 

2 weeks pre surgery I was prescribed strict liquid meal placement 3 times a day. It was so fucking hard for someone who loves food. Post surgery was even harder it was 1 month of clear fluids which means I can only drink clear soup/broth and just sips of water. Then it was 2 weeks of blended meals, followed by 1 month of soft meals then gradually regular food. I can now only stomach maybe 1 spoon of rice, 2 spoons size meat and a spoon veg. But I am able to workout again without feeling pain everywhere - it was painful to exercise when your entire body weight is slamming on your knees and ankles. I sleep better at night, don’t feel sleepy during the day and my back doesn’t ache just to name a few good stuff that came out of it. I’ve had to make some life adjustments regarding eating especially since a lot of our lives revolve around food - social gathering, festivities, birthdays, team lunches, client lunch meetings are so hard because everyone’s like oh you’re not eating? that’s all you ordered? and I wasn’t about to start telling everyone this longass story.

I have dropped approx. 30kg since March and am now at 74. The plan given is over a 10-month period to get to my ideal weight of 68kg. I will be on meds for the next 2 years with medical appointments every other month. Some side effects: hair loss for up to 8 months post op due to loss of nutrients, potentially throwing up a lot as your body adjust to your food intake.  

Now cost-wise, because I have severe sleep apnea and pre-diabetic, this is considered a medical surgery. A lot of tests to be done to determine this. If you don’t have any medical issues, they will not do it for you or it will be considered cosmetic. To which you’re not eligible for any medical subsidies. You have to be Singaporean for the standard health care subsidies (I am). The total cost of my surgery incl. hospital stay (C class) is S$16k (without any further post op complications). As a Singaporean and with medical conditions, you’re eligible for up to 40% subsidy, and the balance can be paid via Medisave (depends on your income, up to a certain amount). At the end of it all, I only paid S$360 IN CASH. Do note that various appointments (Surgeon, Dietician, blood tests, sleep tests etc) leading up to surgery at the hospital (I went to CGH) will cost individual sums, avg. of $30-40. 

I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about the journey in the comments if I miss any info. I encourage you to go for some talks, hospitals hold bariatric talks regularly and are free. Talk to them and find out more even if it’s just for research. 

TLDR: I went for a weight lost surgery and it isn’t as easy as everyone thinks it is but that shit was worth it.

359,Let's be rational about NS deferment for Sportsmen,dhkdk0,2019-10-14 02:36:20,"Right so everyone would have read about the [news on Ben Davis](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/footballer-ben-davis-no-plans-return-singapore-thailand-fulham-11995954?fbclid=IwAR3kBKCjCcXyvHwA2AXlr4qBl-gUF5W0Oc01-fI0-joEp5qcfEvmG_QqlDU) again, and how has no regrets about leaving Singapore behind to pursue his footballing career (in an interview with CNA, he mentioned that he always felt more sense of belonging with Thailand and England than Singapore). After reading all the online comments and vitrol over the issue, I felt that it was important to do a bit of research into how NS deferment (specifically for sports, please) was handled, and how, in my humble opinion, the issue is really much simpler than what many make it out to be, and that (probably unpopular opinion here) Ben Davis really did not make his case favourable for himself (before you jump on me, please read on to understand where I'm coming from!)

In short, for NS deferment for sportsmen there have been three so far: Maximillian Soh (for sailing), Quah Zheng Wen and Joseph Schooling (for swimming). Maximillian was given a year for deferment, and served NS in 2008 or 2009 (not too sure) after he won several accolades but unfortunately didn't perform as well in 2008. For our swimmers, they already had one round of deferment, which was **further extended** when they applied for it till until the end of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Taking a look at the the typical Mindef replies and discussions, it seems pretty clear that, amongst other (smaller) factors, there are two key considerations for deferment: (1) the potential to excel, and (2) the commitment to an 'end' date for the period of deferment.

# Potential to Excel

Fortunately, or unfortunately, Singapore has always applied a 'business' lens to almost every aspect of its domestic policy, including sports. For example, let's assume that we are in the business of handing out grants and money with the aim of helping aspiring start-up businesses grow and succeed. *From a purely business and economic perspective, no organisation would logically give out money to aspiring start-ups that either have no track record or shown the potential to succeed*. Note the word 'potential' here - if a business showed tremendous potential to excel but for one reason or another didn't, it would be lamentable but still reasonably understandable.

The same would be for sportsmen, in my opinion. For the three who have successfully deferred (and I guess Ben Davis too), it is without a doubt that they have shown tremendous potential to succeed in their various areas. While I agree with one comment I read somewhere on Facebook that, technically, Zheng Wen hasn't really shown the potential to really succeed, I think in overall they have proven that they are well and truly above their peers and perform really well, and are thus qualify for NS deferment in this regard.

But should this be the only factor in deferment? Definitely not.

# Commitment to an 'end' date

Based on what I can find online, Mindef has always been clear that if an athlete is able to fulfil (1), they would readily give deferment if they can fulfil (2) as well, because logically there can't reasonably be an 'unlimited' deferment date (if not, it is really like a blank cheque, and going back to the business angle mentioned earlier, does not make much sense). And so in applications for deferments, athletes would have to provide some sort of **milestone to which their deferment would end, and I guess also the opportunity to re-apply for another deferment after assessing (1) again**. It can be a milestone of time, such as Maximillian, where he assessed that one year more would be enough then to prepare and perform...or it can be a milestone of significant games such as our swimmers, where they committed to an end-goal of the Olympics (in 2016 and 2020). I'm pretty sure that, assuming they both achieve fantastic results again at the 2020 Olympics, and Singapore Swimming assesses that they have the potential to excel again at another games (e.g. 2024 Olympics), Mindef would have no qualms about deferring them till the end of the next games, and then reassessing their case thereafter. 

&#x200B;

Personally, what really puzzles me is why Ben Davis would not follow the footsteps of athletes who have successfully deferred, and given that he already has (1), would not do (2) as well. Why not, for example, commit to a milestone of 2 years for example, or commit to a milestone of SEA Games for the AFC, and thereafter, reapplying if necessary? I recognise and agree with what everyone is saying, that the years he is in are the most important in an athlete for their development pathway...and **I agree wholly**. Why not use that and commit to an end-by date, and then if needed, apply again? **All we know is that his father (who is acting on his behalf), was not willing to commit...why not?** This is nothwithstanding the fact that, based on what I could find, his recent statements seem to contradict what his father said in the past, about how he was always willing to contribute to Singapore (vs how he knew he always wanted to leave at 13), and how he was always willing to compete to bring glory to Singapore (vs how he said he never really felt a sense of belonging in Singapore).

In any case, now that this issue is finally 'resolved' and that he clearly doesn't care much about Singapore anymore, hopefully this is the conclusion of a long drawn out chapter revolving around the topics of NS and sports in Singapore, and hopefully, reignites more discussions on how Singapore can manage the development of the sporting scene, and yet without compromising the need for NS.",,70,0.76

While planning my finances I've some question I'd like to clarify, especially with people experienced with the BTO process. 

1. To clarify: **For the Staggered Downpayment Scheme, I will be able to pay the downpayment in two halves - once during booking, and once during key collections (around 3 years later)**. I have heard from colleagues that there is an option to pay the entire downpayment only upon key collection, though I doubt that is true.
2. To clarify: **For evaluation of grants / eligibilities, only the base pay will be considered. That is, OT payments, Bonuses and Allowances are not considered.** I have also heard from colleagues that since the evaluation is based on your CPF history, OT and bonuses that contribute to CPF will also be considered, which kind of makes sense.
3. To ask: I will have to check with the bank, but since I won't be able to get a loan up to 75% of the house value (assume 400k), I will need to pay a higher downpayment. Assuming I get a loan of 200k for the 400k house, my first stage of staggered downpayment will cost me 100k (400k - 200k, divided by 2). The website assumes I can get a loan of 75% (i.e. loan = 300k, downpayment = 100k), and therefore states that I will only pay 5% cash during the first stage of payment. However **if my downpayment is 200k (50% instead of 25%), is the cash portion still only 5%, or will it increase according to my downpayment requirements?**
4. To ask: **Is it safe to assume I will be able to fully utilize my CPF to pay off my loan installments, regardless of whether it's a bank loan or a HDB loan? Or do I need to set aside cash every month for payment?**

These are the questions I've thought of today. I'm planning to head down to HDB Hub and my bank to ask about these next Saturday morning (since I work office hours), but somehow I'd like to get a gist of the entire process.

Also if anyone wants me to help clarify some doubts for them next week, do feel free to let me know :)",,11,0.72

459,Growing up sucks,dgd9sy,2019-10-11 10:36:11,"Just another (Long) text post rant, my thoughts will be all over the place but I need a place to vent before I go into a depressive state again. Thanks Reddit Sg especially those who PM’d me last round, but I just want to be heard, but not to be known. 

Growing up as an average kid in Singapore is difficult. I Guess at least I found it difficult. Each time my mum compared me to my two cousins (who were both blessed with wit and creativity), she’d hold a cane to me and scream “Why can’t you study properly?”. I hated it, not because I was offended by what she said, but because I could never reach that standard- Not because I didn’t try, but simply because my mind wouldn’t let me. 

I remember being recommended for an ADHD check up, which my mum vehemently denied me from (which I’m guessing to shelter me from my career implications down the line). I hated being different, but I could never tell why. My mood would swing based on my emotions and they were always strong, I carried a very jovial and happy front, and when hurt I curled up into a ball emotionally. I could never pay attention for longer than a few minutes, but I’m gifted with a great Long term memory to accommodate to my poor short term memory. I vividly remember memories of my childhood, to the extent that I can remember places, things and even questions from then (but I had no control over what was in my long term).

Till today, I still don’t know if I’m suffering from it, or I’m just imagining it, but at this point I’m just too tired to find out.

I owe a lot to my mum, regardless, for sending me to great tutors after school, who had the patience to guide me forward in secondary school - where I managed barely to scrape into Junior college (I wanted to join a poly, but I get into psych). There (TPJC), I met great Teachers, a fantastic Economics tutor (j2) and a meticulous physics tutor (j2). My economics and physics were consistent E’s (although touted to be easy papers). I never thought that Teachers would be so kind and nurturing to the extent that they stayed back Long after their working hours (close to 6/7pm) just to help me (sometimes alone in a 1-1 consult). It helped me so much that I finally felt competent.

I studied my hardest that year, and was pushed on by my grandma, who I had lived with for years into my teenage years - and managed to score a full set of A’s for my A’s. Could you imagine how happy I was? I’m my mind, I was finally on par with my peers, I was no longer struggling. 

My parents were finally satisfied. My grandma was so happy she called me on my phone for the first time with so much joy in her voice. I was happy, and thought I’d never had to worry about incompetence again, I had finally proven myself to my parents that I was worthy of being a person.

In NS, I experienced my greatest loss, my grandma, who had never placed any academic expectations on me, someone, the only one who had faith in me as a person regardless of how well I did in school, left. The week before, she told me to come back for lunch on the weekend, strong and healthy. I never thought that that would be the last time I saw her. The last time I would hear the voice of someone who I knew had faith in me. (I’m in tears as I look back) I can’t express this hole within me right now, back then and I’ll never ever forget her.

Ns was the fastest phase, it passed simply, and I never really had much expectations placed on my shoulders. 

Post NS, my first experience of how adulthood came. I was lucky enough to had been offered an intern opportunity by a kind stranger, and it just happened to align with my degree. I invited one of my pals from NS- who was going for the same degree. 

We both entered the job with high hopes, and we both worked our hardest. I made an honest mistake in letting a quip go to a coworker, that I wasn’t best of friends with that pal, and as she questioned me deeper, I brushed it off, saying that no one truly was best friends with me. I also said that we gelled extremely well with each other when working, and told her we would make great business partners.

Strange things started happening in the coming weeks. My pal gradually became colder and colder to me, and started becoming the best of buddies with said coworker. 

It took me weeks to find out that my coworker had told my pal about the things I’ve said and twisted it into some sort of “I’m only being his friend for the benefit of him when he becomes a partner of the company”. I was frustrated and I confronted him over it immediately. He told me he had never seen such a snake in his life and I was disgusted at how he chose to listen to a gossip rather than clarify it with me. 

We never truly came to an amicable closure, but I swore never to let anyone twist my words again. I went into work with a friend, and left without one. The two buddies I presume still keep in contact, and I Guess good gossip builds true friendship- something that I’ll never bring myself to do. I was so disheartened that he wouldn’t listen to his pal of 2 years vs this coworker he knew for a month.

Then comes uni, which I am currently stuck in. I honestly have not moved on from my last shit post.  Still the same shit, still the same vibes.

I worked with a few friends on a project as the leader, and I left when one of them claimed my title in order to get an internship.

They took my ideas and entered it into another competition, and just like that I lost all my work to them. I heard they got reported for plagiarism, because they immediately pointed their fingers at me. I didn’t do it. And it’s my fault?

In academics, I lag behind so much but I still put on a brave front. I share notes and anything with my friends, but when I ask one particular guy, he answered me “let me think about it”. I wasn’t angry. I was hurt.

I don’t help people with the expectation of getting help back. I help people because I care about them, but it hurts to know that few would do the same for you. 

Growing up means losing innocence. Growing up means people choose others over you, not to your control. Growing up means losing the friends you had, growing up makes you feel so alone. Growing up means losing the people who had faith in you, growing up means you need to have faith in yourself.

465,today is Coming Out Day,dgbp1u,2019-10-11 07:35:13,"Today, 11 October, is Coming Out Day, a day for LGBT awareness.

Frankly, I didn't know anything about it until I saw this mentioned on Oogachaga. Not surprisingly, Coming Out Day started in the US and isn't something that will be observed in Singapore for a long time, if ever at all.

I'm gay and I've known since I was young that I am. I was never attracted to girls, but even in primary school, the pressures of conforming to societal norms was intense. Everyone had to declare they had some crush on a girl, or be seen as abnormal.

The irony is that as a gay, it was always easy for me to get along with girls. There was no hidden agenda since I was never looking to get into their pants. And I had guy friends who were jealous that somehow, girls always seemed more comfortable around me. 

As for my family, they don't suspect a thing. My beloved grandmother had been saving a special dress for the day I get married. My brother openly disses gays in front of me, calling them 'faggots', not realising he is hurting me too. My mom, one time when I tried putting on a earring (purely for fashion, not to make a statement), was almost in tears and asked if it meant I was gay. I told her no and that was that. I can't imagine what her reaction would be if I came out for real.

I am Christian, and it's been tough reconciling my sexuality with my religion. I was caught off guard on one occasion when my pastor dedicated an entire sermon just on the sins of homosexuality. I ran out of church at the end of that session, inconsolable. 

It is painful to read, see and hear of what fundamentalists have to say about gays. It's always easy to blindly condemn when you've never experienced something first-hand, or personally know someone who has. It's even more painful to know of parents who immediately chase their children out the door upon finding out they're gay. To habour such vile and blind hatred upon an offspring of your love, is to me, inexplicable. 

I know what is written in the scriptures. But I also know how I feel.

I didn't ask to be gay. It wasn't up to me. It's not something I can change. 

Being gay is not a 'lifestyle'. It's not like clothes that can be chosen and bought at a store. It makes me the target of discrimination, ridicule, bullying, hate and even violence. You couldn't sell something like that to me, no matter how great any potential 'upsides' to being gay there might be.

So today, on Coming Out Day in Singapore, I remain truly and firmly closeted. 

For a country that prides itself on doing the right thing, I'm disappointed that a law that puts the crosshairs on gays remains a law to this day. While symbolic, it also provides the license for haters to hate.

To my gay elders who've walked the tough road and paved the way for today's generation to come out easier, thank you.

To the younger ones who're still discovering themselves, everybody deserves to be loved.

And to fellow Singaporeans in a society increasingly divided, I hope you choose to love, above all else.",,1625,0.9

>  
>You’re being a sophist, because it’s pretty evident that Halimah identifies as Malay and has lived her life as a Melayu woman. Whether her father does or doesn’t identify as Malay is a moot point, because we’re talking about her, not her daddy. My point still stands, and you haven’t considered the angle of her father being assimilated into and identifying with Malay Muslim culture (which in all likeliness is the case) even if his IC says something else.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddnqqi/the\_fall\_from\_prominence\_singapores\_arab\_community/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddnqqi/the_fall_from_prominence_singapores_arab_community/)

I came across this comment and thought it might worth a wider conversation / discussion. 

It dawned on me a similar argument where a while American woman **Rachel Anne Dolezal** identified herself as black and for years adopted the culture and framed an body appareance. The Blacks incidentally are not too happy as they have a term **""Blackfishing ""** for it**.**  

The argument that ""Whether her father does or doesn’t identify as Malay is a moot point, because we’re talking about her, not her daddy."" seems illogical. Choosing to abandon one's race and culture is one thing but claiming to be member of another is quite another.  

I would have thought that a better argument is that she was raised mainly by her mother whose is a Malay with all trappings of the Malay culture rather than claim of allowing someone to have a choice of identifying oneself with another race.",,0,0.49

I mean, really? Sure, the film could have done without it and still function equally well, but that's what they are saying to substantiate a 2.5/5 rating, because they threw in some easter eggs and some fan service?

I mean his superficial comments of how it's trying to be a non-comic book-y serious drama, while pandering to fans with references, is his main gripe, is extremely surface level for a piece that he's admitting is hard to ignore or has made an impact.

There were zero mentions of the Google Pixel 3. I called Starhub Sales hotline and they said  that the free phone is dependent on availability (while stocks last), and I will have no assurance if I can get the free phone. I will only know if stocks were available at the point of delivery. If stocks were not available, too bad. This means that they have the flexibility to tell everyone that there were no stocks available, after suckering everybody into a 2 year contract.

508,Limpeh hoping to leave it all behind and start a new life in Singapore,dftgfg,2019-10-10 05:32:59,"Hello all Singaporeans, looking for advice.

Here's my situation: I am a Singaporean who spent more than a decade in the US. I did my NS more than 5 years ago and I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree. I've been working as an engineer in the US for nearly a year and have been living a very comfortable life, but I'm tired of being in the US.

When I was in Singapore, I was surrounded by family. Here, I just feel so lonely sometimes. No girl wants to touch me here and while I don't feel discriminated against, I feel left out a lot as a minority and disrespected (it's uncommon for Asians to be promoted to management). As a side note, I tried tinder in the US and then in Singapore. I had maybe 5 matches a day in Singapore but in the US I had maybe 3 a week (guess which girls ghosted me and which didn't). But this is more than just my love life; I also want to feel comfortable and I feel most comfortable among my people.

Yet, I have reservations about moving back, which is mainly my career. I feel like I've chosen the wrong major as I think a Mechanical Engineering degree is hard for transitioning back to Singapore. I know that there is Mechanical Engineering jobs in Singapore but I've heard that in general they are underpaid, overworked and underappreciated. I honestly wouldn't mind taking a pay cut to feel a sense of belonging again, but I do want to be on a career trajectory that leads to a respected and well paid profession. (Engineers are paid very well in the US, which is the only reason why I'm sticking around).

What can I do in Singapore career-wise? Can I transition to a different sector such as say, finance or business analytics? Would any of you recommend staying in the mechanical engineering industry in Singapore? What can I even do with a mechanical engineering degree? How do companies view it?

Even if you can't answer the questions, the more information I know about working in Singapore the less blind I feel. Even tangential stories about engineers in Singapore would help a lot, or even career paths. Thank you everyone for your time.",,70,0.82
509,Aggregated Driving Tips from r/sg,dft04x,2019-10-10 04:46:20,"In a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/d8jpdn/drivers_in_sg_what_are_the_starter_pack_driving/) I asked about some starter driving laws and tips. Here I have compiled a list so that all can refer.

### Parking
- Do not park at Zig zag yellow lines, double yellow lines, near fire hydrants or against traffic in small roads 
- Do not park on either side of the road when there is a single or double white line in the middle.
- Do not park at single yellow lines between 7am to 7pm except Sundays and PH.
- If parking at HDB look out for the red sign at the bottom of the parking sign board that states if it's only reserved for season parking after 1030pm if you're visiting friends late at night.

### On The Road
- Always keep left unless overtaking and always signal your intention.
- Remember your cashcard or just sign up for vCashcard. Always signal your intention.
- Bus lanes: Normal (Mon to Fri 7.30am to 9.30am; 5pm to 8pm), Full-day (7.30am to 11pm everyday except Sunday and PH). Always signal your intention.
- Take note of mandatory giving way to buses. Recognize the marking especially near bus stops. Always signal your intention.
- Lamp posts with yellow markings are monitored by LTA cams. Always signal your intention.
- Beating red light right turns is as good as beating the red light. Clear traffic on opposite end doesn't mean go if the light is red. Always signal your intention.
- When in the rightmost lane to turn right, turn into the corresponding rightmost lane. Oh and always signal your intention.

### Good Advice
- During discretionary green man turns check for cars and check your mirror for motorbikes trying to squeeze through your sides, physically turn your head to check left and right for pedestrians.
- There is no buffer for speed limits. 90 is 90.
- Right lane is for overtaking, especially on expressways. If you are not going fast enough, move out of that lane.
- Aggressively overtaking and cutting lanes will only save you seconds. It isn’t worth it and you just make it worse for others. Start your day right and just keep in your lane and follow the order.
- Smile and tell yourself why be angry. Everyone is also human. He could be your father or brother. She could be your mother or sister. Humanise other road users and suddenly a PMD user, cyclist, taxi driver or whoever seems more bearable and you just learn to live to let live.
(thanks to u/BumSophistication for this whole section) 

Hope this helps people. Drive safe and remember always signal your intention.",,100,0.95

I need wifi to do school work and generally things that require the internet. I have no idea where to start searching for rooms or whether a hostel would be better than rented rooms/houses that I just stated, I’m kinda at the end of my rope here so any advice would be kindly appreciated, if any of you here are currently living in a rented house/room and wouldn’t mind being my roommate, I would gladly come down and have a chat with you.

574,"Food for thought: ""A minority-race poet is involved in publishing material that the government of the day considers offensive...""",df4jd9,2019-10-08 19:04:39," ""A minority-race poet is involved in publishing material that the government of the day considers offensive.

Words are bandied about publicly as accusations - ""left-wing"", ""socialist"", ""English-educated"".

Elsewhere, Chinese students riot in the streets. The government draws links between these two separate incidents.

The poet is arrested along with his associates and put on trial.

The university defends him and even pays his bail.

(One of his seniors will later make the case that their trial was accidental - the offensive material was actually ghostwritten by the seniors but they had to take exams so they let the juniors do it.)

He is defended by a young lawyer who subscribes to their work, who brings in a foreigner to help defend him - both work pro bono.

The young lawyer helps the poet and his friends crowdsource for funds. Foreign politicians, including the soon-to-be PM of Malaysia, send in money to contribute to the defence.

A young newspaper journalist writes several articles supporting the poet and his friends. He defiantly titles his column ""I write as I please"". He is called in for questioning by the government.

The defense is successful and the poet and friends are acquitted.

The young lawyer becomes incredibly popular as a result of this, leading directly to him forming a political party in the same year, with the young journalist and several of the poet's friends.

The poet is Edwin Thumboo.

The senior is SR Nathan.

The journalist is S Rajaratnam.

The lawyer is Lee Kuan Yew.""

What medications/therapy/accommodations are available to you? I'm objectively not coping well and am considering going to see the school psych, but is it worth the trouble? Does a diagnosis make it easier to cope? 

Also based on my limited research, I get the impression that there aren't a lot of ADHD resources in Singapore. Adderall is illegal. Are doctors here against prescribing other meds like Ritalin? Also I seem to be more aware of other mental health conditions/neuro-atypicalities among my peers.

> 2. For protesting in front of Parliament House against the govt's lack of action on climate change - she would be arrested, because even a one-person public protest here is regarded as an illegal assembly, and her protest sign would be seized by the police.

> 3. Govt-controlled mainstream media will do a hack job on her, painting her as some sort of destabilising agent, with insinuations that she is paid by foreigners.

> 4. Pro-govt trolls will attack her viciously online - accusing her of being ungrateful and ignorant (see, PM Lee already said $100b will be spent on fighting climate change in S'pore!), that she is being paid by foreigners, or at least is a willing pawn of foreign agents who want to destabilise Singapore, that she should have made use of Speaker's Corner instead of striking in front of Parliament as a stunt.

> 5. Ex-MPs from the ruling party will write to the govt-controlled media/press to slam her, accusing her of wanting to bring ""western-style democracy"" to Singapore.

> 6. Ministers will make speeches about foreign interference, citing her as a negative example, questioning who is funding her.

> 7. She will be charged in court for her protest, or she will be issued a ""stern warning"" by the authorities.

> 8. Greta will, under such intense pressure, then issue a public apology, and pledge never to walk outside the straight and narrow again.

> 9. And then all will be silent, and peaceful in Singapore.

> 10. We are once again saved by our rule of law.

640,Wildlife in Singapore; Part 48: Mangrove Whistler,dem421,2019-10-07 16:49:16,"Hi r/singapore, this week I'll be talking about another species of bird that is the sole representative of its family in Singapore, the [Mangrove Whistler](https://singaporebirds.com/species/mangrove-whistler/).

Like the Golden-bellied Gerygone (which I talked about [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/db5bl7/wildlife_in_singapore_part_47_goldenbellied/)), the Mangrove Whistler is an insectivore that forages in the treetops. It's a small, plain-looking brown bird [with a distinctive song](https://www.xeno-canto.org/447967). However, while the Golden-bellied Gerygone is a common, widespread species that has readily adapted to urban areas, the Mangrove Whistler is much rarer, and has a very restricted distribution. It usually lives in mangroves and other coastal vegetation, although it is sometimes found inland, in wooded areas and abandoned rubber plantations.

For some time, [the only publicly accessible location](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/10-rare-resident-bird-species-in-singapore-and-where-to-best-find-them/) in Singapore where birdwatchers could reliably [find the Mangrove Whistler](https://flic.kr/p/9kVyLJ) was [Pulau Hantu](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/nss-blue-and-green-survey-22-feb-2018/). Given the tiny size of Pulau Hantu, the population of Mangrove Whistlers [living there](https://fryap.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/grey-thickheads-at-ghost-island/amp/) is very small. Pulau Tekong is apparently a stronghold for this species, but needless to say, visiting that island is out of the question for most birdwatchers. It has also been found on occasion [on Pulau Semakau](https://flic.kr/p/bpGwPU), with the most recent record taking place during a bird survey [in August 2018](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2018/09/23/singapore-bird-report-august-2018/).

In the Southern Islands, besides Pulau Hantu and Pulau Semakau, in the 1980s, the species was known from Pulau Ayer Merbau (one of the smaller islands that now makes up Jurong Island), as well as Pulau Pawai, Pulau Senang, and Pulau Sudong (the three islands that the SAF uses as a military training area and live-firing zone). Just like with Pulau Tekong, visiting these islands today to verify the continued survival of the Mangrove Whistler is extremely difficult, if not next to impossible, for members of the public.

In the north, besides Pulau Tekong, the Mangrove Whistler is known to occur on Pulau Ubin, with more sightings taking place [in recent years](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/singapore-bird-report-september-2017/).

The Mangrove Whistler has vanished from various sites in mainland Singapore where it was historically present, such as Jurong Lake, Khatib Bongsu, Kranji, Loyang, and Simpang. Sadly, even populations in apparently protected areas aren't necessarily secure; the last sighting of this species in Sungei Buloh was in September 2001. Although there have been several sightings in some locations the last decade, records remain scattered and sporadic. In the east, it was recorded from the reclaimed land at Changi East [in January 2015](https://www.nss.org.sg/report/ac1fd3a6-2Singapore%20Bird%20Report%20-%20Jan%202015.pdf)), [Tampines Eco Green in July 2015](https://besgroup.org/2015/08/07/mangrove-whistler-spotted-at-tampines-eco-green/), and [Pasir Ris Park in July 2016](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/singapore-bird-report-july-2016/). In the south, a lone bird was seen at Marina East in [July 2017](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/singapore-bird-report-july-2017/). Most recently, a Mangrove Whistler [showed up for several days](https://flic.kr/p/2h5rpwu) at [Jurong Eco Garden](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/177185201) in [August this year](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/singapore-bird-report-august-2019/).

Just like the Golden-bellied Gerygone, the Mangrove Whistler is the only representative of its family that lives in mainland Southeast Asia; the family it belongs to, the Pachycephalidae, mostly comprise species that live east of the [Wallace Line](https://www.asiangeo.com/heritage/wallace-line-kangaroo-meets-monkey/), in Australia, New Guinea, and various island groups of the South Pacific, as well as Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands and Maluku Islands of Indonesia. Only three members of this family can be found west of the Wallace Line, with the Mangrove Whistler having the widest range, stretching from the coasts of northeastern India and Bangladesh to the Andaman Islands, Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina (where it is also found inland in the Tonlé Sap region of Cambodia), Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali, and Lombok, as well as Palawan in the Philippines.

651,What are those bright ass neon parades that play very loud techno?,deisoy,2019-10-07 12:32:35,"Second time this month I've seen a parade of large neon-lit vehicles playing bad techno. They stop by my block for a few minutes (which I wish they wouldn't) before moving on and the sound is deafening. Not to mention the bass. Ow, my ears. I live quite high up on my block and they were louder than anything I was playing at home. Definitely impressive sound systems on their trucks, unfortunate that this was the choice of music. 

They're accompanied by cop cars and bikes, and seem to take up the entire road. Once they leave, regular traffic begins and you could see the dense lines of vehicles that resulted from them taking the entire road. I don't think it's Chingay, Chingay wasn't this obnoxious.

Anyone has an idea what they are, why they're accompanied by the police and why they get to hold up traffic?",,9,0.8

I had previously thought that Singapore, being quite similar to Hong Kong geographically and economically, and also given its history of striving for self-determination (I'm not too familiar with this actually), that people there would be able to somewhat sympathize with what's happening in Hong Kong.  So I would like to get some insights from local Singaporeans here.

\--------- 

1. If you are a Singaporean- Chinese, how do you view your cultural heritage in relation to China?

686,Is it normal for police to guilt trip people to come to the police station for interviews?,dedicv,2019-10-07 02:46:03,"I am posting here because r/asksingapore is very inactive.

I recently reported an e-crime to the police. I had 2 phone conversations with 2 separate policemen who followed up with me about the case on the same day of the reporting (5 days ago). I am very appreciative of the first 2 police officers as they were very understanding about my case and their prompt response was excellent.

Just today I received another call from a third different police officer, asking about the case, and if I could come down to be interview regarding the case. However I currently live in school, a long way from the police station, and I am currently having exams. Moreover, I have classes to attend every day from 9 to 8 and the breaks in between classes are insufficient time to go down if not I will miss class.

I told the police officer, but rather than working to arrange a common timing this weekend, she still insisted on me coming down on the weekdays, saying things like,

""you were having exams but you still chose to make the police report around this time..?"", ""you know I would like to follow up with this case ASAP..."",""I mean you can come out of school to the police station right..? It will only take an hour.."" (no, it will take 3+ hours considering the travel time from school to the police station).""I mean the police want to work on this case but we need more information...""(but all the information and evidence, I had already fully given to the police????)

Moreover, she kept asking me basic details about the case that I had already mentioned in my report, and to the other 2 police officers. She also asked me very difficult questions like, ""how do you think this is a crime?"" and ""what do you think the police officers can do?"" I know for a FACT that what had happened was definitely a crime, but I was unsure of what to do hence I went to the police officers in the first place to ask about it??? What kind of question is this?

I am beginning to question if the person that called me was even a police officer in the first place... are all these things normal for a police officer to say to a citizen..? Apologies as this is my first time reporting something to the police and I am unsure of all these procedures.

Edit: I tried to offer to come down today in exchange for some letter to show my teachers that I was away for something urgent, she said she could not do it. I tried to offer a fixed timing on the weekend or on friday after my exams for me to come down to the station, she also declined.

There seems to be a very limited selection of OTC meds in Singapore. For example, watsons, guardian and unity pharmacy only seems to have Voltaren for anti-inflammatory creams, and it is insanely expensive (a small 20g tube is $10!).

Tried to find aspirin...this is a commonly available, low cost painkiller...watsons doesnt appear to have it and guardian only has a box of 30 tablets for $10. WTF.

I dont know whats going on, whats with these prices? Why are common OTC meds so hard to get here? I mean, look at Australia, you can get a box of 96 aspirin tablets for $4 and their average wage is like, twice that of SG?

I would like to avoid climate, immigration, ban PMDs, pinkdot vs WAAPD, POFMA, NS, discussed-everywhere-else issues please. I'm keen to hear new and interesting stuff! 

Here's some of my random stuff to kick things off:

\- Shoving flyers onto car windscreens should be treated the same as littering. Makes no sense to me that if a person leaves a flyer in a carpark lot it's littering, and just because my car happens to be between the flyer and the lot and suddenly it's legal? I've driven off with a flyer flapping on my windscreen more times than I care to confess :D

\- Molesters go to jail. Straight up. 

\- Abolish PSLE or get rid of the through-train program. I think it was a BIG mistake getting rid of PSLE and putting even more pressure on 12 year olds. Either delay that ONE BIG IMPORTANT EXAM so that kids are more mature when they take it on, or put in more exam levels for people to have multiple chances to get into the stream of their choosing and one's education destiny doesn't fall down to a single exam.

\- Reward drivers for courteous driving, at least temporarily until courtesy is ingrained. A lot of us aren't polite drivers (well, still better than some other places I've been to), but as another post has discussed, there's just no reward for being nice. Put that reward in place. Instead of asking driver to post videos of shitty drivers, have them post videos of courteous drivers. Courteous driver AND the poster both get a small reward (haven't thought hard enough about what that reward should be yet)

\- Why is our individual tax rate higher than corporate tax rate? The richest in Singapore probably earn more through dividends than through salary so their resultant tax on a company owner would be lower percent than their highly paid employee. Raising corporate income tax does have knock-on effects on businesses. Instead it might be worth considering a small dividend tax to equalise against individual income tax.

The above is just a mixed bag of verbal diarrhea which may or may not work, but would win my vote regardless. I'd be interested to read yours too! :)",,23,0.69

On the 21st of September, we held a rally at Hong Lim Park that attracted over two thousand Singaporean Citizens and PRs, who stood together in solidarity to support stronger government action in addressing climate change.

We are an independent group of about 20 concerned individuals - university students, climate researchers, academics, scientists, lawyers and programmers. Relying on collective action and capacity building, we call on the government to take bold systemic action to mitigate the climate crisis.

We will be online between 5-8 PM today, so ask us anything!

735,An idea to help charities raise money and create jobs for poor elderly and handicapped.,ddn2ta,2019-10-05 13:11:35,"Its simple. Hire the unemployed old/handicapped people to raise funds for charities using ezlink card/cashless methods. (Government regulated)

&#x200B;

Why unemployed/handicapped?

This is the one job that they definitely do better than young, healthy people. They can evoke more sympathy from the people and raise much more money. Its like the beggers at the mrt station but this time, they are not beggers, but dignified employed fundraisers helping to make the world a better place.

&#x200B;

Why ezlink/cashless method?

Its easy. Just beep and go. They will also raise more money because the doners know the money goes directly into the charity accounts. At the end of the month, the charities will pay the employed fund raisers a portion of the funds they raised as commissions.

&#x200B;

Why government regulated?

Prevents frauds. The police can make their patrols and check the registeration numbers of the ezlink device 

&#x200B;

EXAMPLE: Imagine an old lady with a shelter dog raising funds for an animal shelter outside an mrt station. Doners can just tap $1 and go. The dog would love it. The old lady gets paid and the passerby will feel good helping others.  

&#x200B;

Win win situation for everyone

&#x200B;

Government = create more jobs for old/handicapped ppl, help reduce the number of fake beggers on the street. 

&#x200B;

Old/handicapped ppl= gives them dignity, wages, empower them to help others. This is a job they can definitely do better than young, healthy people.

&#x200B;

Doners= makes them feel good about giving and also let them know that their money is definitely going to good use

&#x200B;

Charities= A huge source of income for charities. This will raise more fund as it will be far more acceptable to the people than hiring young, healthy people to raise money. 

&#x200B;

How to implement this?

Election is coming, MPs are going to make their rounds, they will ask for suggestions from the people. If you like this idea, tell them this suggestion. You can print it out and pass it to them.

&#x200B;

(Anyway, I am sure my idea can be improve, I welcome all criticisms.)

769,Punishment vs Rehabilitation,ddcmuo,2019-10-04 20:01:34,"I think there has been a lot of discussions on the recent cases involving university students who are guilty of sexual offences. It seems to me on this sub that most people are of the view that said offenders should have received harsher punishments and not be allowed mitigations based on their academic performances and other related factors.

It also appears that while most people here are supportive of more punitive responses to such crimes, almost none of us are concerned with the rehabilitation of such perpetrators or with the detrimental effects more punitive measures could have on their rehabilitation. It’s as if we have decided collectively as a society that these people are lepers that should be casted out and left to fend for themselves. It’s as if we have decided that these people are not worthy of any redemption. Basically, all we are saying is “let’s lock them up” without actually caring about “what do we do about them next”. 

I can’t help but feel that the systematic way we treat and outcast people who commit such crimes is the reason why we have a culture where sexual crimes and misconduct are so perpetuated and normalised. In another thread, we see how there are telegram channels with thousand of members dedicated to voyeuristic contents, many of which involve children and teenagers. This is a worrying trend and I personally feel that this is a result of us avoiding the elephant in the room. Discussions about sex are usually considered taboo here in our culture and especially so for certain sexual compulsions. We fear discussing issues like these so much, we have no choice but to compartmentalise it as something completely abhorrent. The only reasonable response to that for us would be to chuck them into a small corner away from our lives(both figuratively and literally), and avoid having to deal with them again. 

However, being outcasted with nowhere to go, people with sexual compulsions and tendencies have to resort to forming their own in-groups as a show of solidarity and to feel “normal” again. This might be a very warped sense of belonging but it is the only way for them to feel like a functional member of society amidst their dysfunction. 

I may be in a minority here, but I feel that whatever the case ruling, the judge had the best intention. There is always a fine line in balancing punishment and rehabilitation, and it being a zero sum game sometimes, giving more of rehabilitation means giving out less of the other. Too often, we fail to realise that perhaps such crimes are manifestations of underlying behavioural problems and that these people are more in need of help than of punishments.

Just to play the devil’s advocate, I’m actually wondering if in the case of sexual misconduct, would more jail time or caning(punitive) be a more effective response against let’s say, probation/counselling (rehabilitative) for the perpetrators. Because let’s face it, when we give them more jail time and harsher sentences, the less likely they are able to seek actual outside help on their compulsions. If we do not treat other addictions by just locking them up only and pretending that they no longer exist, why should we do the same for addictions of a sexual nature?

TLDR: We fear what we don’t understand, and we don’t understand what we don’t talk about. We don’t talk openly enough about sexual crimes and compulsions/addictions, and this is the reason why we are seeing worrying trends today. Faced with such symptoms, would punishment or rehabilitation(or a little of both) be the more appropriate response to such crimes?",,60,0.75

775,Why do people own a Car in Singapore when it is really expensive,dd93r4,2019-10-04 15:44:00,"Hi everyone,

I am a foreigner who came to Singapore to study for my Masters. I am originally from India. 

My question for everyone over here is why do Singaporeans own a car when it is so prohibitively expensive. Over a period of 10 years it costs 160k(Basing it on the numbers given in the link below). The public transport is really good, on time, comfortable, etc. So I can't fathom why would anyone want to buy a car. The option of taking a taxi is still there when you can't take public transport from time to time.  Even if a person takes a taxi almost daily, it would still not reach the amount you pay for the car over a period of 10 years. I have not even included the cost of renewing the COE after 10 years. Then the added cost of getting a driving license.

I understand one of the reasons can be prestige, to show off that you can afford to buy a car. Such people will always be there, but is everyone like that ? Why buy it when these days you can book a taxi at the push of a button. 

Can anyone share the other legitimate reasons why people buy cars ?

778,[serious] family issues,dd6vp3,2019-10-04 12:46:16,"My family has been arguing for about a year now. The crux of the issue is that my dad is useless and egoistic and insists on running his (dead) business, while my mum is trying to hold our head above the water. My dad has also borrowed money from my relatives numerous times, and has also borrowed money from me. Recently, he decided, for some god knows reason, to purchase a new 8 seater car, and now has trouble paying it off. I was asked by my mum to help pay 2.3k recently. That's my entire NSF pay so far. This money issue, has of course lead to quarrels and basically a dysfunctional family. But it gets better.  


My grandma \*needs\* a domestic helper, it would literally be impossible for her to live day-to-day otherwise. But the contract is almost up, and there's been arguments about whether to continue the contract. My mum claims that she has had to pay everything, which is somewhat true, but my grandma claims that the other relatives can help pay - which is somewhat true. To summarize this argument,   


1. relatives don't want her to stay with them because troublesome 
2. a lot of my richer relatives (i have an uncle who's supposedly a board member of Singtel) do not help with the costs at all 
3. my family needs help financially
4. my dad has asked numerous times from family members to help pay off his loans from loan sharks, angering them 
5. my dad has too high of an ego to sell off his red-zone company and get a real job 
6. my dad also has too high of an ego to ask for help, and when he does he keeps evading the issue and pressuring relatives to lend him money. 

I'm fucking tired. I don't care about this family. If there was a choice where I could sever all ties with them and live on my own while maintaining at least some degree of financial dignity, I would. My depression bouts have become more severe and prolonged as a result of constant family issues. But tough luck - I'm in the army. I'm also in a stay out unit - so I have to keep facing the same thing every night after night - shoutings and shoutings, and my dad pretending he doesn't know anything and going downstairs to smoke. What am I supposed to do? The obvious solution, for all 3 of them, is to explain the situation to relatives and get them to actually be fillial for once ( and not bring her out to eat porridge every once in a while), and help up with the finances, obviously not paying my dad but ME. But all 3 of their egos are STUPID HIGH and they will not consider this option.

But that isn't the only issue, if you're trying to be nice, helpful, friendly or just a better person, the society here just tells you 'hold my beer, imma ruin this person with good intentions'

You can say, 'oh ! Every place got dick heads and cunts, don't get too worked up, I'm sure there are nice people who appreciate your efforts all around'

See, I don't disagree with the statement. But it's the concentration of ungrateful people or assholes around here that is so promenient that sometimes you think where the people who appreciate someone with good intentions are.

Let's take the example of drivers here for example. Everyone is always in a rush to get home or somewhere, and if you're a nice driver and always give way, you're going to be tested because people are just going to take advantage of the situation, and not give a wave to say thank you. Hell, or even cut in at such a speed where its unsafe for themselves or even you. 

It's going to drain out a good person when he or she who is extremely caring, generous or nice just keep helping people, and it keeps happening that everytime the people that they help turns on them or just becomes a asshole right after. It's going to seriously make them consider if they even feel being nice is even worth the effort.

I've seen good people who just get really exhausted because of the environment, the people they have to deal with etc.

Take the example of the other thread about helping beggars. And given how often people get MLMs trying to make a quick buck out of people who are kind enough to give them their time, only to find out its a MLM makes it very quick for pedestrian to find anyone coming up to you on the street as doing something for their own 'benefit'.

Edit: I'm not speaking on my own actions. I'm speaking of the general attitude in Singapore.",,606,0.91

803,"Why academic excellence is a justified, effective appeal reason in the Justice System?",dd1q6i,2019-10-04 03:16:32,"This has been a hot topic among Singaporeans due to recent sexual misconduct cases in Singapore. The purpose of this thread isn't to condemn or condone the judge's decisions, but I hope we could bridge the understanding and thoughts between low-class people like me and IBs.

Here's what I think:

- We were indoctrinated to meritocracy and the judges went through the painful path to achieve academic excellence to reach where they are today
- Those who excel academically could contribute greatly to Singapore in the long-term compared to jailing them
- I also want to make it clear: I'm fully aware that this is a standard practice in other countries too. There have been outcry about this issue in other countries too

Nevertheless, I disagree because

- It's unfair to sentence educated people to far lower sentence when Singapore has a reputation for being tough on law enforcement. This kind of system breeds the mistrust among the people and the judiciary, and no matter what new Contempt of Court legislations passed won't be able to help it
- Those who commit these crimes though they can still be useful in the society, they are just a minority. Missing these few perverts will not dent the Singapore's economy
- There are many lower SES/less educated people who could've been hit far worse than these educated scholars by a jail term, who already have less potential in life could paralyse their future more deserve the magnanimity than these educated scholars—even their worst outcome is still better than many.
- That being said, I really don't know if Singapore benefits more or the perpetrator himself/herself benefits more from this scheme. I don't think Singapore's economy will dent while I think this system is enriching the perpetrators to help them stay/get to high SES life just because they are scholars",,49,0.81

807,What would need to happen for you to vote for the other party?,dd0z98,2019-10-04 02:08:22,"Since elections are soon upon us, I thought this would be an interesting discussion to have. What would the other party have to do in order for you to change your vote? So if you are a staunch PAP supported, what would the opposition need to do to get you to vote opposition, and conversely, if you are a die hard WP voter, what could the PAP do to earn your vote?

(Please try to avoid ""nothing, the PAP/WP is perfectly horrible and I will never vote for them"", this is mean to be fun). 

Also, this discussion is just for fun and you should remember that it is not a good thing to be a single issue voter, and when the election does come around please assess the parties holistically and not merely based on their view of your pet topic. 

To kick things off, I've always voted for opposition but if the PAP did one of the following things I would actually vote for them (assuming that the opposition does not promise the same):

1) Repeal 377A, and set a road map on how to eventual reach marriage equality. This is pretty self explanatory. 

2) Set out a comprehensive climate change plan. This should cover both mitigation and preventive measures, and would set out benchmark goals for each phase of our climate change strategy - for example in phase one gathering information via studies to be conducted on the effects of various things like single use plastics (and their alternatives), air-conditioning/central air-conditioning, car ownership, electric vehicles, and in phase two implementing policies based on the information done in phase one.

826,Is anyone else annoyed by Golden Village’s 20+ mins of ads?,dct29q,2019-10-03 16:12:52,"It’s my first time posting here, so forgive me if I do something wrong. I just saw Joker(great movie btw,) and ordinarily my night would have ended there, but...

The show timings indicated that the movie would start at 21:20. The movie actually began at 21:47. That’s 27 minutes of being bombarded with ads that frankly I had no interest in seeing and that I didn’t pay to sit there and watch. 

My friend and I paid money to go and watch a 122minute runtime movie, and got some drinks to go along with it, we did not pay to watch almost half-an-hour’s worth of ads. 

Am I the only one who feels cheated of my time here? Whenever I make a booking, I certainly don’t think, “oh hell yeah, I’m gonna totally enjoy watching this dank movie, along with the 20+ mins of ads that golden village theatres will show me. I can’t wait to see the Visa ads, they are my favourite!” 

Maybe there’s something in the terms and conditions that I missed. I’m gonna go home and go through them(cause I’ve got nothing better to do.) I just wanted to know what my fellow Singaporeans think...

Edit 1:- Sorry, I just wanted to put this out here. I went through the Terms of Service for Golden Village’s services. It doesn’t explicitly say anything about ad timings. Could anyone with experience in law or something like that confirm whether they can continue imposing these kinds of unwanted ads, without disclosing it? I’m not gonna sue, im just really curious...

Was walking home on my usual path and there was a girl walking ahead of me by a few metres and we we've been walking the same path for a bit.

She kept turning her head abit to see who's following her and all to the point where it got quite obvious to me, so I took out my phone and used it as it was getting awkward.

After sometime, she stopped to the side and used her phone. I'm pretty sure she was feeling scared so I just walk pass her without looking at her and walked to my block lift which was really close at this point of time. 

Pressed the button to call the lift and while waiting, i realise that she walked towards the lift as well so it was obvious she stays there. 

Lift came, i entered the lift and pressed my floor but she didn't press anything. I knew that she wasn't one of my neighbors, so she's still probably being cautious of me. 

Lift reached my floor so I waited for a milisecond for her to leave the lift as she was standing closer to the exit but she didn't move. So I just walked out without looking back.

I know that she felt cautious of me since we've been walking the same path but man, that hurts like hell. I know i'm very tanned and tall, possibly intimidating but come on she could atleast waited somewhere for me to be out of sight or something. I was prepared to show my IC of where I stay incase she made a scene lol.",,76,0.7

853,//RANT STORY// Entitled auntie on MRT,dcn4c5,2019-10-03 06:39:21,"To start off the story, I live in the east part of SG and I travel to the north for work. The journey takes about 1.5hrs, so sometimes if I’m running late, I will just leave home first then do my makeup on the train ride instead cos I don’t want to screw up all the transfers timing. So that particular day, I was running late so I planned to do my makeup on the train ride. I boarded and after the train cleared a bit, there was finally one seat but it was the dreaded ‘reserved seat’. I mean honestly if I can choose, which self-respecting millennial would choose to sit there and suffer the constant panic attacks that someone is secretly filming them not giving up their seats to the elderly? But sadly that day, I was that self-disrespecting millennial which think ‘aiya just sit and faster get my things done’ as I don’t want to turn up for work looking like zombie from The Walking Dead. So I sat down, took out my makeup and was just about to start dabbing it on my face, when the train door slide open at the next station and my nemesis to be rushed in and started to look around the train for a seat anxiously. She looks late 50-ish, with a pixie-cut short hair dyed in reddish orangey colour, and was dragging along her wet-market exclusive canvas trolley bag which have spring onions poking out of it. 

My detailed observation of her was my downfall, as it compelled me to look at her face and that led to us having eye contact. It was that moment when she realised that I was the youngest amongst others sitting on the reserved seat (the train was not packed but there were no available seats and she have a good view of everyone sitting down. There were late 20s/ early 30s ppl sitting on other reserved seats too). Once she had the eye contact, she dashed right in front of me and said: “Can you give up your seat to me? (ni ke yi rang wei gei wo ma?)” 

All these happened within seconds, I stoned and stared at her and then look down at makeup laid out on my thighs. My first few thoughts were ‘wah can’t you see I busy?’, ‘this auntie high level one, know how to ask for seat type’ and ‘wah siao liao sibei suay, need to do makeup whilst standing liao’. After my groggy brain went over all these thoughts, I started thinking like okay how should I pack up. I stoned for 5 secs looking at my makeup before starting to put things away. I think my pause to think was quite obvious cause within a split-second after my movement, the lady beside me (late 20s – early 30s ; she look older than me) stood up and say: “Nvm auntie, you sit here, I’m getting off on the next stop”. I admit that I was relieved like ‘heng ah, she da real mvp.’ But this comes the annoying part, the auntie had the audacity to say to the lady: “aiyo nvm nvm, young people must let them stand one. (aiyo bu yao jin bu yao jin, nian qing ren jiu shi yao zhan de)”. 

I WAS INSTANTLY TRIGGERED BY HER COMMENT. Normally, I would just ignore all these annoying passing comments as I’m just too lazy to argue or make a scene. But on that day bcos I have so much angst thoughts on my mind that words came out before I even realised. I turned and look her in her eyes and said ”why young people must stand? (wei she me nian qing ren jiu shi yao zhan?)” And then I saw the glint in her eyes which says ‘wah this girl dare to rebut and challenge me ah, ooookay challenge accepted, let me educate you this disrespectful millennial’ and then she started to speak in a louder voice, her eyes darting around, looking if anyone was looking at us. “You don’t know this seat is for old people one ah? Only old people, injured people and people who have small baby can sit!! (too lazy to translate in pinyin lol)” She said loudly, whilst poking and tapping against the reserved seat sticker above my head. 

Honestly, when she started talking loudly, I totally have no decent comeback and was thinking this time confirm kena STOMP liao. But she gave me the BEST REBUTTAL when she said the “…people who have small baby…”, which I used when I look at her straight in her eye and said: “THEN HOW YOU KNOW I NOT PREGNANT?” She opened her mouth ready to argue before staring at me incredulously and then closed her mouth and look away. 

I mean yes I am young but I am also a woman so I have womb right?? I can be pregnant too right?? Or do I need to stick an ultrasound baby photo on my forehead to prove my pregnancy? I can be 2 months preggo but have skinny limbs? But in all seriousness, I not preggo but just PISSED AT HER COMMENT?? I was ready to pack up and leave the seat FOR HER then she just had to add in that comment. I know many friends who are not feeling well and just have to give their seats because they don’t want to look bad/scared kena STOMP. We may look young on the outside but who knows if we might recently had surgery, fever, pregnant or feeling giddy etc. And whenever young people like us ask for seats or refuse to give up seats, we are immediately judged unfairly or negatively. 

Continue on with the story, the auntie kept staring at me angrily after my rebuttal and I continued to put on my makeup, ignoring her. And the way she stared was so annoying, it’s the type that when you turn to look at her, she turns away then when you look away, then she will turn and look at you. I’m so done with her and she is getting on my nerves so I turned and just stared at her until she turned and met my eyes. Then I continued to maintain eye contact with her before I tilt my chin up then down in a “gangster” way which meant “what do you want now?” She immediately said “Whattttttttt?” in a loud and draggy way. I just roll my eyes and continued to do makeup. Then finally it’s my station and when I was getting off, I can see that she was staring at my stomach, trying to see if I’m pregnant lol.

I know I totally don’t deserve the seat but I just want to teach the auntie a lesson. I do still give up seats to REAL elderly, preggo ladies and injured ppl. Just to further justify my character, I once gave up a non reserved seat to a domestic helper who is younger than me because she asked me politely and told me that she isn’t feeling well and is a little giddy. And then people around us stared at us weirdly and gave judgemental looks. The girl saw their looks and looked awkwardly down at her feet.  
So yes, if you tell me that you want the seat or you are not feeling well, I will give you the seat. But please don’t add your discerning comments which just show how entitled you are. Don’t make young ppl’s gesture of good will become your entitlement bcos we don’t owe you anything. We pay same fares or even more sometimes. So even as a senior, please correct your attitude. You also know that the reason why you aimed me is bcos I’m the youngest person there sitting on a reserved seat and when someone older than me offer you a non reserved seat, it suddenly becomes “oh nvm nvm”.  Why is it nvm? Is it because young ppl like me deserved to stand or because her seat is not a reserved seat which you ARE ENTITLED  to? 

So hopefully this will teach her not to assume that all young ppl sitting on reserved seats don’t deserve it.  And a life tip to the ladies, just say you’re pregnant if you really need a seat. Please search your conscience and do it only if you really need it. But unless you’re a guy then my pro life tip can’t help you at all, sorry bro.

PS. Please share your burn stories with me and self-righteous ppl can just bugger off cos ain’t nobody got time for dat.",,1399,0.93

The men in the Telegram group are bad. We can all agree on that.

But we can't stop there. We can and need to find the root cause of the issue and help them out.

In discussion with a few people, we have agreed we can class these sexual deviants, including pedos, as mildly mentally ill, and hence need to be reached out rather than just told to be nice. This will be beneficial to everyone as a preventive measure.

Some proposed ideas are ~~legalisation~~ _promotion and regulation_ of prostitution as well as better sex ed. 

A hot point of debate is whether NS contributes to the issue. I think it does, but feel free to talk it out as I don't have a full conclusion yet.

Please be nice, and avoid general term and insults. Please also don't get too angry, if this pisses you off too much switch off, it's not worth getting mad at a Reddit thread.

895,I binged 6 hours of Toggle's The Last Madame cause I support local - Review and TLDR Inside!,dc7oj1,2019-10-02 09:10:03,"&#x200B;

[Pic from AsiaOne](https://i.redd.it/2z0bk0pag3q31.png)

So yesterday, I binge watched The Last Madame, the latest Toggle original starring Joanne Peh. Yep - I wanted to support local. Also because Fiona Fussi is a beautiful human. Now having watched all 12 half hour episodes in a row, I felt that I should pen my thoughts and give a condensed review to the SG redditors that aren’t planning to watch it. Cause why not.

Am I film student? A licensed critic? An experienced screenwriter? No x3, I just like films. But I spent 6 hours on a Toggle original, so I am gonna try make my national service of supporting local worth my while. Here goes - ***Toggle execs, I hope you see this.***

**TLDR:** The Last Madame was bad. Cringey bad. 5/10. The best scene in the whole show was the first 3 minutes in the pilot. But I rate other Mediacorp shows of the same genre 1-3/10, so thanks to bellcurve, TLM was a clear grade above the norm.

Now before I get attacked for airing my criticism frivolously, I wanna clarify that I am fully aware a lot of work went into this project, and that all parties involved probably wanted and did their best to see it go well. My criticism today largely covers **screenplay and direction**, not so much on the performances.

Now while TLM was bad TV in comparison to other works out there, it did leave me optimistic for the future of Singapore TV, cause it did many things right - more so than many of its predecessors. So I'm keeping an open mind. Read on.

# SPOILER ALERT. I tried to condense my thoughts below but if this gets more traction I might make a video going more in depth on my criticism.

**Quick overview:** The Last Madame is told across two arcs. A modern day arc (Fiona’s arc) and a flashback arc (Joanne’s arc). Fiona’s character, Chi Ling, is an investment banker from HK that returned home to SG to sell her great grandma’s (Joanne’s character) shophouse for 17 million (lmao). It is there where she bumps into history buff/pro-bono barber/plantation worker Guo Wen, who tells her that the shophouse belonged to an old Madame (Joanne’s char) of a brothel. Fiona says she’s not interested in his spiel, the guy protests, and they scuffle abit before falling over each other - Kdrama style, all within 40 seconds of meeting. *Sexy.*

So now her ankle is twisted, and plot dictates that she’s forced to sit around and listen to history nerd ramble about the brothel and her great grandma. We are then introduced to the flashback arc for Joanne’s character aka the Madame. The rest of the series goes on with to and fro jumps between past to present. The Madame arc is some weirdly written gang war/murder mystery flick that kind of functions, so I’m not gonna harp much on that plot wise.

After the Madame arc concludes, Fiona’s character decides that she needs to ditch that 17 million payout and KEEP the shophouse for herself (cause yknow - traditionz). But she does not have enough money to restore it so she SELLS her stocks in HK. But she still doesn’t have enough so homeboy Guo Wen pulls out the ultimate lifesaver by telling her he actually owns the plantation instead of just working there so he SELLS that too and they get enough money. Oh yea she also falls in love with Guo Wen. Did I mention she was engaged to her boss a week before?

Yep.

# The Good:

\- Editing was pretty solid to my normie eyes. No glaring lighting/conti errors or weird cuts - it was smooth. Fight scenes were painful but I dont think I’ll blame the editor for that.

\- The scene in the pilot before the intro credits. It introduced the theme of the show well with enough intensity and intrigue to pique my interest to say ""oooh not bad"". When they cut to the intro with the gasp, I almost clapped. Sadly, this was the best scene of the entire series for me.

\- Believable integration of singlish and 'proper speak' in the story.

\- Soundtrack. Dope af, loved the intro song (anyone know where it's from?)

\- Joanne Peh’s acting. I think I found her performance the strongest of all the cast members. Fiona’s wasn’t bad as well. Props to Brandon Wong for being very expressive with his rage too. But sadly, everything was ruined by the dialogue - but we’ll get to that later.

\- Sexiness + racy content. The “Joanne nude scene” (episode 9 for the researchers) and other sexy hooker scenes were honestly surprisingly realistic. Even the “semi rape” scene near the end was not the normal messy montage you see on Channel 8, the scene was actually pretty graphic and caught me by surprise. Overall, adult themes in the show were WAY more saucy than anything I’ve ever seen in local tv so it’s really cool to see local productions exploring more controversial topics. This compliment doesn't extend to the dialogue leading up to the sexy times sadly.

\- Small shoutout to Alan Wan's character, Chi Ling's fiance. The handsome dude was actually the most realistic character out there. He behaved exactly how a young investment banker boss would. They wrote him as rich douche, but he turned out to be the best dude and overturned quite a few stereotypes.

# The Bad:

\- Forced themes. I understand that stuff like cultural preservation is a must talk about topic especially if a film is “gov funded” or whatever, but the whole “we must preserve” messaging was REALLY in your face the entire time. Likewise for the underlying feminist themes. It was a tad overdone. It didn’t help that these forced themes were often prioritised over plot and character development.

\- The protagonists. Both Fiona and Joanne’s characters were passive protagonists with unrealistic or unclear goals which made them really unsympathetic characters to follow. (Fiona’s character much more so because her entire arc was low stakes. If she failed, she would sell the house for 17 million and not find out about her great grandmother. Hardly world ending. At least the Madame would have been wrongly accused of murder.)

\- The modern arc was unnecessary. Apart from serving a function to open and close the Madame arc, the entire modern arc could have been axed. What we got was corny channel 5 plot filler nonsense with an unbelievable romance plot woven into it. The only real purpose of the modern arc was exposition. Next point.

\- **Too much exposition.** Characters constantly provided unnecessary exposition in their dialogue, completely disregarding ‘show not tell’. “Oh do you mean we are looking for a spy?” “Are you telling me last night meant nothing?” “Did you know that this gang is the fiercest gang” etc etc. *Maybe* the show was targeted to older folk with slower grasp on plot concepts, but honestly, I dont see my granny watching local brothel drama. She’d be shaking her head so much at the harlots she’d miss half the show.

\- Chemistry and romance. None of the leads had romantic chemistry with each other, and it made the already terrible story writing and hookups extra unbelievable.  This point is extra sad cause I know Joanne mentioned she wanted to go nude for the show cause it would exhibit the character's inner turmoils and passions better. But that's just it. The characters were so poorly written that none of that served any purpose cause I didn't believe they were infatuated - it was rushed and forced. I think I actually compressed myself into my chair 3-4 times during my watch yelling *""Wtf you're banging??!""*

\- Too many dick jokes. *I'm serious.* I get it, it's a brothel and ya'll nasty gals, but the random dick jokes out of nowhere were super cringe and takes the mood out of serious scenes. :(

# The Ugly:

\- The dialogue. The dialogue in this show was ***horrendous***. Exposition every 4 sentences. Lines that do not sound like what normal people would say. And the seduction lines were ***tear jerking***.

# BUT...

The Last Madame showed that we have the potential. The shell - editing, production quality, soundtrack, acting chops (kinda), was there. But I believe a **good screenplay was all that was missing** to carry that shell to a respectable level. We are close - I think.

Finally, to answer the age old Singaporean rebuttal to arguments - *you so smart you can do better meh?*

Yes, I really think I can write a better screenplay than what we got.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

899,Some personal thoughts on the recent PSLE math papers complaints,dc78rm,2019-10-02 08:11:25,"I thought there are two interesting phenomena perhaps worth looking into regarding our PSLE math exam:

1.	Of the 4 PSLE subjects, Math is the one that kenna complained almost every year. Why specifically Math?

2.	Yet, there seemed to be little or no complaint of the Math papers last year. What happened? Is it because it’s manageable? Is it a bad thing?

.

**The issue of differentiation**

-	Regarding the difficulty of PSLE math questions, one common point raised is that we need to differentiate the students. But I think we might need to examine deeper just what this differentiation is needed for, especially with regards to PSLE.

-	Is it to solve administrative problems like school allocation? Is it to help students learn better by splitting them into different groups? What is the purpose of this differentiation?

-	If the purpose of differentiation, is to split students into different groups after PSLE, then it is similar to streaming. We would then have to probe deeper into the issues of early-age differentiation/streaming. Is Primary Six an appropriate time to stream?

-	Returning to the 2nd phenomenon I wrote at the top, there seemed to be no complaints about the PSLE Math paper last year. Is it going to be a big problem for that batch of students in terms of differentiation?

-	And just what is the main purpose of PSLE anyway? I think we need more conversations on this issue.

.

**PSLE differentiation and ‘arms race’**

-	An emphasis on the need to differentiate students through PSLE can fuel a competitive vicious-cycle, sort of like an ‘arms race’. This is what I speculate can happen:

-	In order to compete and differentiate themselves from the rest of the cohort, students would need to study harder. In order to compete and differentiate their child from the rest of the cohort, many parents would engage tutors to help improve their kid’s result. So overall, there is likely a general increase in the students’ ability to handle the PSLE Math papers.

-	But because of this increased overall ability, PSLE exam board would have to set tougher and tougher questions just to so-called differentiate strong students from the rest, because the formerly tough questions are no longer tough enough anymore.

-	And as the questions get tougher year by year, students would need to work even harder year by year, as the bar is raised even higher and higher. Such that hiring Math tutors become even more of a ‘necessity’ to many parents. Which makes the exam board try to set even tougher questions just to so-called differentiate students. 

-	So just when is this bar high enough?

-	Of course, this is just my speculation. But perhaps there may be some truth to it, especially in the area of Math. Why is the PSLE Math paper often singled out? I find that interesting.

-	I think the recent move by MOE on banding the PSLE results may help in de-emphasizing differentiation and the ‘arms-race’. Let’s see what happens.

.

**On the need to have more think-out-of-the-box problems in exam**

-	I have actually done a few past year PSLE Math papers and past year O-Level Math papers (yup, I’m a parent). My feel is that, the O-Level Math papers are more straightforward and manageable. The PSLE Math papers, not so. 

-	One reason is that I can use algebra equations for O-Level, whereas some of the problem sums in PSLE are made unnecessarily difficult because of the cumbersome model method.

-	Another reason is that O-Level questions seem pretty standard to me, whereas PSLE questions are less standard. Not sure why this is so.

-	Perhaps there is the misconception that by setting more indirect and think-out-of-the-box questions in a Math exam, we are encouraging creative problem-solving and thinking skills in our education system. But the fact is, to effectively tackle a Math exam like our current PSLE system, there is a need to actually drill and practise more.
 
-	The fact of our PSLE system is that, a student has only limited time and energy to try to complete a full Math exam paper. He/she can’t afford to spend too much time on all the questions. He/she must be able to recognise most of the questions immediately and work on them, then there’s a chance to complete the paper in time. 

-	And the only way for this to happen, is drill-and-practice. Then most of the questions would be familiar to the student. He/she can then work much faster and with much less effort during the exam, saving time and energy to tackle the few challenging and atypical ones. 

-	So by incorporating more and more indirect and thinking questions in an exam, we might actually be ‘forcing’ students to drill-and-practice more, just to be able to cope with finishing the exam paper.

-	Our current system of examination is not really suitable for examining thinking skills and creative problem-solving.  Until the mode of assessment is changed, trying to incorporate more atypical questions into the exam paper only forces the students to drill-and-practice more so that these atypical questions can become typical ones to them, and the paper can be completed in time.

.

I think there is some validity to the complaints parents make about the difficulty of the PSLE Math paper. We shouldn't dismiss them too easily. 

Again going back to the two phenomena I mentioned at the top, why so.

Coupled with the rising suicide rate among youngsters and the many sexual offences committed by tertiary students and the issues of privilege and class-divides and SES segregation and what-not, I think we need to look deeper into education issues and try to sort them out as a whole. There may be certain common themes threading them all that we are failing to see at the moment.

904,Minister Shanmugam points out lessons Singapore can learn from HK protests,dc67ae,2019-10-02 06:02:25," 

Singapore— Speaking at the Minister’s Awards Presentation Ceremony at ITE College West on September 30, Monday, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam pointed out several key lessons that the country can learn from Hong Kong’s troubled past few months.

His main point was that it took just a short while for the world’s regard for Hong Kong police, long believed to be among the finest in the region, to change. Along with it came as well a change in Hong Kong’s relations to the rest of the world.

Mr Shanmugam described the present condition in Hong Kong as “people versus the police,” according to a report from [the Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shanmugam-highlights-3-lessons-for-singapore-from-hong-kong-unrest) (ST).

The Minister said that in 2017, a public perception survey that came out revealed 90 percent of Singaporeans trust Home Team officers to perform their tasks with integrity and objectivity, and that they relied on these officers to ably handle times of national crises.

#### But he cautioned that “This cannot be taken for granted, and we cannot assume that it will always be there.”

\- Advertisement -

The Hong Kong police, he added, had been believed to be “disciplined, highly professional, effective.” However, due to the protests since June, as well as the stories that have come out in the press, demonstrators have been portrayed as those championing the cause of democracy, and police officers have been shown from a less flattering perspective.

Mr Shanmugam says this has caused “unfair criticism” for the police.

From this situation, the Home Affairs and Law Minister extracted three important lessons.

Number one, he said that internal agencies do not always provide the most important answers.

### “They are a solution for tactical problems, but the problems (in Hong Kong) first of all start from politics, and the fundamental socio-economic issues,” Mr Shanmuham noted.

“The responsibility starts with the government to get the basic issues right in society… If the fundamental issues are wrong, and 10,000 people go on the streets every day or every week, no police force I think can deal with it, including in Singapore.”

Lesson number two is that Ministers need to take responsibility in these kinds of contexts, instead of the police. Making a reference to the incident in 2016 wherein a 14-year-old boy who had been allegedly involved in a molest case was found dead.

Back then the Minister said,”My ministry has the responsibility for the protocol that is in place. And ultimately, responsibility is with me, as the minister. It is not with the individual police officers. Their responsibility is to act according to the protocol in place.”

He echoed this in his speech on September 30, emphasizing that responsibility lies with “the people right at the top, not the individual officers facing the public on the ground.”

For the third lesson from the Hong Kong protests, Mr Shanmugam pointed out how crucial it is that the public is fully informed about events that occur.

”Because if we leave an information void, the public will turn to unverified sources, rumours… It will happen anyway, but you’ve got to try and prevent it.”/ TISG",,13,0.68

1) 4 years degree
2) self study based (i have a friend who goes to school only once a week)
3) lack of cca or student bonding
4) lack of facilities and common space

which sounds fookin boring

i’ve come to a point where i no longer see much value in a “local uni cert” and tbh, i just wanna get a degree and enjoy the last few years of my studies before i become a corporate slave 9-5 squeeze in MRT jk but yea i’ve been thinking of switching to SIM GE instead since it’s faster and has more student life.

nonetheless, i’d like to know what you guys think? if any of you been to SIM GE or SUSS and can give me some insights on life in campus?

thanks!

edit: i’m looking to apply full time!",,5,0.58
915,National unity?,dc3pw6,2019-10-02 01:59:53,"I feel that our country is the way it is now because of mistrust amongst the people.

Business owners view employees with disdain because of policies that promote government goodwill at the expense of company profitability. So contract jobs and contractor style hiring is the trend to protect businesses. 

Employees view business owners with victim mentality because the government promised higher wages and better lives but businesses are not delivering this promise. Instead wages have stagnated. People also do not understand why flexihours cannot be applied to customer service staff in clinics, retail, tuition and fnb. So when people feel that they are unfairly compensated, we only put in the amount of commitment and effort that we think commensurates with our pay. 

The old lament the lack of respect for the elderly because of advocacy by the government that somehow they are deserving of payback by the generations after them. They also blame companies for discriminating against them and choosing to replace them with younger workers. They feel that they have the right to retire regardless of how much they saved before and the nation as a whole should come together to finance this because they 'helped built the nation'. 

The young bemoan the unfairness of having to support the old when they are barely surviving themselves. High housing prices that grant windfall to the generation 20 years ago now impede their ability to own their own property. People associate starting families with more bills first and foremost before anything else.

According to POSB, as Spotify is listed as Spotify Stockholm, there is a 2.8% additional administrative surcharge resulting in SGD $15.40 being paid.   
   
According to bank: not their fault and cannot do anything as long as the company listing foreign. (Spotify Stockholm)

According to Paypal: not their fault as they only collect 14.98SGD.  
According to spotify: also not their fault as the receipt only show 14.98SGD, which is the same amount they collected.

People messaged me about this, told me to mod it for them, then ghosted me when I asked to meet. Why the hell do some people do this? In fact, why does everyone who has approached me about this item ghost me, even after I say I’m willing to nego? At the very least just tell me the price is too high and you don’t want the item before telling me to mod it! Otherwise when you ghost me I have to unmod the PSVita in case I want to sell it to a shop!

EDIT: the guy just told me his Budget is $15 lower than the price we agreed on. At this point, I’m done with him. I’ll give him the item at the price he wants, but I’m going to report him to Carousell, and give him a shit review. If anyone wants to know his username, it’s _wanchiro_.

965,Unreasonable and Entitled Customer,dbn9y2,2019-10-01 03:20:32,"Hi guys, I just wanna ask if this customer in question is being unreasonable af or is it just me for being a shitty service provider.

Recently, there's this customer who wanted to buy one of my dresses and requested to meet at her church at 4.30-5pm. So I went there and guess what? I waited until 5.40pm and there's no sight of her, nor could I manage to get a hold on her via messages. Then after 6.30pm, she replied and said that her phone ran out of battery. So okay, nvm I thought. And then she proceeded to blame me for not being visible at our meeting location when I WAITED 1 hour, standing like a fool carrying heavy bags so I went to sit down at a nearby chair which is like 10m away. So okay fine. We arranged to meet up on the next day but I've requested for a deposit first.

Next day, everything went smoothly but a few hours after the meetup, she told me that her neckline wasn't low enough like the photo shown, and accused me of being dishonest. Despite me being open to customers to try out the dresses FIRST with no commitments of buying before purchasing it. Normally I would go out of my way and even exchange dresses for them if they couldn't wear it. But this is a case of picking a needle in an ocean for mistakes imho. She's blaming me for not being able to sell a dress that can fit 100% her abnormal body size (everything else fitted nicely, it's just that the neckline isn't 3cm lower irl like the photo), and despite me putting disclaimers first before the deal, yet she still blames me and requested a refund. Literally nobody had problems with my stuff unless it's something genuine like a factory mistake. She could request to come and try it first before buying but apparently she's too busy on her schedule and nobody else is busy. Except her. So now her shortcomings got labelled as my fault.

Before asking for a refund, she wanted an exchange based on this opinion of hers, so I told her that I'm unable to fulfil it as I've put in more cash and time than I'm supposed to in order to deliver 2 times (2nd time pro bono out of goodwill), so I told her that if she can foot out $8 for a third party deliveryman, then by all means I'm fine with it. But she couldn't, and now she wants a refund. I'm transparent throughout this ordeal and even told her the market rates for shippers.

So tell me, am I being dishonest? Am I not accomodating enough to waive the second delivery fee because of her silly mistake at the first one?",,39,0.82
