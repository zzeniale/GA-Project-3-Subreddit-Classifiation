""She knows the old man upstairs has a young girlfriend.""
""She knows who had a promotion at work.""

Then there is the sound of a child crying off screen, leading the auntie to pause her watering and look up. Then she returns to her watering as the words ""but she doesn't know about the child."" or something like that.

7,Having a nanny look after your kids.,dleoiy,2019-10-22 07:54:55,"As a foreigner one of the things that strikes me about Singapore is the amount of children I see being accompanied about town by a Nanny from a developing country.

This isn't something I'm used to seeing where I come from.

Singaporeans, I was wondering about your experiences with this. Is it only for the rich or is it common for the middle class too?

Did you grow up with a Nanny? If so did you bond with them? Are you still in touch with them?",0,0.5,13.0,"Its common to have a live in nanny from developing countries. There are about 200k of such nannies in Singapore.. They're called domestic helpers.

It's super common.
We employ a wonderful Filipina helper whom my kids love and she cares for them deeply.

It's not just for the wealthy as that it's not all that expensive to provide an opportunity for a domestic worker to earn substantially more income than they might be able to in their countries.

Often they send the money back home in its entirety.

So you'll see it often and there's nothing wrong here. 

I'm not sure what country you're here from but I'll bet that's not the only thing that you'll find different.. With both parents working, maids or nannies are necessary for many.

I didn't grow up with one as my mom was a full-time housewife but I know many neighbours who did have a maid as both parents were working.. I think what you are referring to are domestic helpers. Besides looking after the kids, they do the housework etc. too. Not only the rich hire domestic workers, middle class people do too, especially for households with both parents working and no one can look after the kid. In my experience, we didn't keep in contact with the domestic helpers after they returned to their country.. Not nannies. Those are domestic helpers, live in maids, basically.

It's super common. It actually makes a lot of financial sense if you have 2 or more kids and 1 elderly to look after.

This setup allows both parents to work, cuts down on eating outside food, frees up a lot of time and energy for you to spend quality time with children, saves some money on childcare at the same time, etc etc. The elderly at home also acts as a guardian, making sure that the domestic helper isn't doing anything fishy. It happens, I've friends and relatives going through this.

I'm not doing it myself now, but when my father becomes too old to take care of himself and if he choose to move in with me, there's a good chance I'd get one.. They're called maids.. To own your home even if it‚Äôs public housing HDB, both parents need to work. A double income is must for a young couple especially for the down payment. As both parents need to work, the maid becomes a necessity. Child care, cr√®ches etc are options but are more expensive and not not generally favoured. 

Society has also become more egalitarian with women preferring to have their career. 

Maid dynamics is quite complex. Some with passage of time have become family members of sort, others are abused while most are happy for the work in order to send money home for their future.. It is relatively common, even for middle classed families. I grew up with a domestic helper till I was about 16/17, throughout the later years it was mostly so that someone would be able to look after my aging grandmother. 

I spent most of my days with them for around 2 years and bonded a fair bit with them and learnt new language skills, went to gatherings with their friends, etc. We haven't really kept in contact with any after their 2 years with us but I know of a few who would send us texts/letters a year or so after leaving to ask after us before we lost contact.. Singaporeans work 60 hour work weeks to pay for the car, the house for the maid to stay in and the maid to take care of their children. Then they wonder why their children don't have any emotional attachment to them.. Look into maid abuse and you'll see how well that's working. Other countries have working parents too.. Despite the downvotes, I think you do raise a very valid point. There really are some gross employers who treat their domestic helpers like they're less than human. We should call them out at every opportunity because we do not want to implicitly condone that sort of behavior. 

In all fairness, I think there are employers on the other side of the spectrum too. And we shouldn't demonize all employers of maids.. Other countries end work zhun zhun at 6pm.",704.0,7,83,1

10,"Property agent fined for fake offers: Home buyers' and sellers' agents can share fees only if they declare, say experts",dld6np,2019-10-22 05:19:38,notexthere,9,0.9,3.0," 

SINGAPORE - Questions have swirled after a property agent was given a  record sentence for faking offers in a private home sale, with the aim  of getting a bigger commission from the seller at the expense of his  client, the buyer.

How often does this occur, and can a property agent represent both  the seller and buyer of a home, and get commissions from both?

Real estate experts told The Straits Times on Monday (Oct 21) that  they believe the practice is rare and an agent generally cannot collect  commissions from both a home seller and buyer.

But when there is no conflict of interest, agents can enter  co-brokering deals in which the agents for the seller and the buyer  share the fees, as long as the arrangement is disclosed.

On Monday, the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) said that it had[ fined a property agent $30,000 and suspended him for 12 months](  for giving his client, a home buyer, fake offers from the seller to get  a bigger commission. The agent was also getting a commission from the  seller but did not declare it to his client.

It is the highest sentence meted out so far to a property agent by  CEA, the statutory board that regulates the real estate agency industry.

The council said Ngu Ping Chuan James Ethan of PropNex Realty behaved  unprofessionally and unethically while facilitating the purchase of a  condominium unit in the eastern part of Singapore between 2016 and 2017.

The 39-year-old failed to represent his client's best interest and  instead prioritised his own profit from commissions, causing his client  to suffer a disadvantage of about $20,000 to $30,000, CEA said.

The council said that under its code of ethics, Ngu should have  declared in writing to his client the conflict of interest in getting a  commission from the seller.

Experts said that in the resale market for Housing Board flats and  private estates, the seller typically pays the commission to the  property agent, although the buyer might choose to pay a commission too  if he engages a property agent to help with his needs.

However, licensed agents know that it is illegal to collect commissions from both the buyer and the seller.

""If they did so, that would constitute a conflict of interest,"" said  Mr Nicholas Mak, who is head of the research and consultancy department  at ERA Realty. He has been in real estate for 22 years.

Mr Mak said that all legal agents have to sit an examination which  comprises an ethics module, with the key takeaway being that they must  always represent the best interest of their clients.

But in some cases, agents can enter co-brokering deals, where the  buyer's and the seller's agents share the commission paid by the seller.

For instance, this would happen for private resale homes since the  buyer does not pay fees and only the seller pays the commission.

Agents who co-broke will need to declare their agreement to their  clients so that all proceedings remain above board, said Mr Mak, who  noted that such arrangements are ""a fairly common practice in the resale  market"".

Typically, agents representing the buyers will ask the home sellers'  agents to share half of the fees the sellers' agents would get, said one  expert, with 15 years of property experience who declined to be named.

""If these two agents are not relatives, and not working in the same  team within the same company, it is assumed that there is no conflicts  of interest,"" he said. ""The buyer and seller are usually aware of their  agents' fee arrangements.""

But co-brokering deals where there is a conflict of interest should be rare, said the expert.

""Once we are aware that there may be a conflict of interest, we will  probably ask a colleague to step in and take over the case,"" he added.

Although buyers and sellers may feel the need to get in direct  contact with each other to prevent cases like Ngu's from happening to  them, Mr Mak said a fine line needs to be tread.

""Property agents are afraid of being cut out by the process too.  Property agents are by and large a hardworking people but as with any  large group, there are black sheep that need to be weeded out,"" said Mr  Mak.

""To maintain the high professional standard of the industry, discipline must be maintained."". Wow...that thumbnail really makes Singapore a concrete jungle.

More buildings than trees. Hmmmm, for private properties, the 'usual' practise is for the buyer's agent to share commission with seller's. The buyer does not pay commission at all.

For HDB, buyer and seller pay their own commission.

Do note that CEA scrapped the idea of 'standard practise' some years back, so it's perfectly fine to negotiate with your agent.",852.0,20,1,1

> SINGAPORE - Moderating the price of groceries and cooked meals will become a greater focus for the labour movement, as three of the cooperatives under its social enterprise arm - FairPrice, Foodfare and Kopitiam - will be grouped under a new NTUC FairPrice Group.

> FairPrice chief executive Seah Kian Peng, who took on the additional role of NTUC Enterprise group CEO earlier this month, announced this at a briefing on Tuesday (Oct 22), where he said that the move is aimed at driving greater efficiencies and catering to consumers' evolving food needs.

> FairPrice Group is working on several projects and details will be announced at a later date, he said.

> Asked what the move will mean for consumers, Mr Seah, who is also an MP for Marine Parade GRC, said that customers' experience will become more ""seamless"", citing the example of how the FairPrice Finest and Kopitiam foodcourt at Funan mall already offer cross-promotions. Foodfare and Kopitiam will also work closer together, he said, without giving details.

> More are eating out, with more than 60 per cent of meals now made up of dining out, takeaways and food deliveries, Mr Seah noted. Food now accounts for more than a quarter of the average monthly household expenditure here, amounting to $1,199, he said. This is 25 per cent more than a decade ago.

> Against this backdrop, the three entities will come together to address the cost of living more efficiently, he added.

> ""The three (co-operatives) provide food solutions, whether you want to cook at home, eat out or have things delivered... individually we are leaders in our own space. The question we ask ourselves is 'can we do better?',"" he said at a briefing at Heartbeat @ Bedok.

> Related Story Kopitiam: Even picky eaters will find something to eat

> The new group will have 573 outlets in total, including supermarkets, hawker centres, foodcourts, coffee shops, pharmacies and convenience stores. These will comprise 375 under supermarket chain FairPrice, 121 under Foodfare and 77 under Kopitiam. FairPrice Group will remain under NTUC Enterprise.

> Its acquisition of foodcourt operator Kopitiam, completed this year, has made it the largest operator in Singapore, with 64 foodcourts in total. It also manages 35 coffee shops and 12 hawker centres.

> Mr Seah noted obvious ""synergies"" between its grocery and cooked food segments, such as the ready-to-eat meals and food preparation services on offer at its 90,000 sq ft FairPrice Xtra hypermarket at VivoCity, which opened in August.

> Asked whether there are plans to expand the format to other stores, Mr Seah said that there have been ""many requests"" and it is looking at the option.

> In the meantime, he said, FairPrice, Foodfare and Kopitiam will continue to moderate the cost of living through their own initiatives.

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( Yea prices can be low, but then the food portion smaller and smaller. Sad life.... Just like cookhouse, food so good, they give it away for FREE!.

That would be true if this was a free market monopoly. But in this case it's state-owned. Kopitiam is basically Cookhouse food that you have to pay. 

But yeah the state of hawkers is really x100 bad, people constantly want the same low price for food but rent/bills/ingredients/etc is going higher.. Do not confuse Kopitiam with Hawkers. Kopitiam is a food court that has lost its spirit in search of profit. It is not what Singapore grew up with when we were poor.. vote with your wallet, eat indie. Hello Polis, i've found the commies /s. then why not just nationalize it?. Looking at track records, the savings will not be passed to the general public. So it won‚Äôt get any cheaper.. you have to remember what type of state this is. You have hawker centers for nationalized food.

Food courts are are normally run by private businesses - so in this case this is already a semi-nationalization of food courts. Track records - care to elaborate?. Which is?. The fact that you have to come up with your own word with ""semi-nationalisation"" means it's not luh.. hawkers run a private business. they have no price controls and are subject only to hygiene regulations. they‚Äôre not nationalized at all.. Just look at singapore public transport.. Uh huh, what about it?

And not to say, extremely shallow. All they care about is how they are portrayed on the photos.. There's this fairly popular instagrammer who graduated from NUS, quite pretty and always parading her boobs online. However she's one of the most fake person, you know those people who talk in a super fake voice and very insincere? Big turn off. The one I know got into trouble with law. His wife is some horsed face lady that debut in some music video called something wine. He's overall a nice guy, at least that's what most of us followers think he is.. I knew a local Chinese rapper (hint: people criticise his Ang mo accent). Tried really hard to make it here but SG is really no go, so now he ventures overseas and makes pretty good money. We were sort of close but after graduation not anymore; he was always the popular sociable butterfly while I am the exact opposite, anyways. He worked on improving himself ever since secondary school.

He had always tried to make me come out of my shell and our last meeting he invited to meet his celeb friends and go parties, but I didn't want to embarrass him haha. He's a hardworking and decent dude and deserves his success. I'm both happy to have known him and for his success as well. Not many people can genuinely say they make money doing what they love. Can't say I'm not envious, either!. The guy doing mirror Naruto run and Budget endgame trailer.. one of the most Creative person I‚Äôve met... Glad that he‚Äôs doing great with his idea these days.. 

he collected all the empty canned drink from my campmates and made a iron man model out of it [video]( To us he‚Äôs just a typical singaporean boy who runs one of the photography Instagrams. 

He showed me some comments on his photos and some of it are ridiculous. Lots of hate out there. A ton of people out there love to cry FRAUD or give advice.

He sells his photos online as well. Once a hotel picked up one of his pictures to put in the hotel lobby or something. Someone took a picture and accused him of stealing content haha.. I've encountered 2 types of influenzas so far. 

One that is really freaking obsessed with social media to the point that I think it's unhealthy. Everything also diedie must post on insta story and derives their self worth from how good their feed looks blahblah. Stick their fucking phone in your face so can catch reaction or smt. Will go to specific places just for the photos, wear really unpractical stuff so they look good in a photo. (Like pretty but flimsy sandals to go hiking at macritchie and ended up forever complaining feet pain) If instagram shut down for a day I think they might have identity crisis.

The other type is the self-aware ones which are a lot more tolerable. They don't revolve their lives around social media but if an opportunity arises, like they see a nice place for photos then they will take a couple or shots there. Their online self isn't a far cry from their actual self, just a more polished portrayal I suppose.

But they aren't full-time social media personalities. So maybe they would treat it differently from how a person that does it as a full-time job would treat it?. I played guitar for an event together with an ACS boy many years ago, he was just super nice and sweet but already then had an incredible voice. I still remember he loved mimicking Jacky Cheung‚Äôs singing style (and did it well!) Today he‚Äôs one of the hottest singers in the mando-pop world.. SO lives with an influencer. he‚Äôs a really toxic and sloppy person. never ever cleans up after himself. dishes in the sink haven‚Äôt been washed for months. yet he will scold like mad if others aren‚Äôt perfect housemates.. One prominent influencer still owe my friend 6-digit sum money. Lol always talk very big online but behind close door in loads of debts.. Had a classmate that is a local actor. Just a normal guy, hanged out with him when we were young at his house and play n64 together. 


He didn't do so well in school iirc, I mean I am not doing well too and hes in the same class as me. He's also playful and would get in trouble sometimes. 


After he graduated, we didn't keep in touch and I just saw him on channel 8 last night on some drama, glad hes doing well I guess.. Knew a popular male singer two years before he debutted in Taiwan.

Generally a fun guy. Rarely get into trouble haha. Even after like 3 album released, he is iewed as the 'most boring singer' for tabloids.. as other than his creative endeavours, there's nothing for them to juice/hype up

Also, was once in the same class as a female theater actress, during lower primary. Was surprised to see her on a ad for a theatre production she's in, as back then she was quite.. restless in class, i guess?. Hi. My ex CCA mate in early sec sch later became some sort of do everything model / actor / host / personality in his late teens / early adulthood. Even then he was very animated and sometimes slightly... pompous. And had a very outgoing, almost flirtatious and sunshine personality.  However his animated pompous ness and drama seem bit pretentious and irritating. Must say his personality is perfect for entertainment.  


Met a few thru my work. Albeit passing encounters, less than a day each time. First impression for one actor / host / DJ guy was that he was shorter than he looks on TV. Accidentally physically bumped into him as part of said work and I apologised, he took no offence, was very cool about it and seem like he could had been a very good friend.. I know a popular youtuber (although he stopped producing vids). They are like normal people, with normal people problems, don‚Äôt think you should see them for what they are on screen but just try to really get to know them as a person, not much different from my other friends.. I don't personally know her, but there was this pretty lady that used to come to eat in the restaurant I worked in all the time. And I served her so often that she knew me and I guess it was expected of my managers that I would be the one taking care of her whenever she dines.

&#x200B;

I cannot remember her name, and honestly didn't know who she was until my manager told me that she's a local actress turned politician or something.  (I Googled Singaporean actress but her picture did not show up).

&#x200B;

I don't work there anymore though.. Good friends with a minor IG ""celebrity"", count or not? 

She is what she is. She doesn't have a sugardaddy like some haters think. Her family has money and she's just enjoying life and showing it off tbh. She a self-admitted attention whore but she's genuinely warm and friendly with her close group of friends.. Fake asshole in real life too.. One instagrammer was my primary school classmate for about 3 to 4 years. We went on to the same secondary school and stayed as friends, but lost contact after she switched to an IP school.

She was quite nice but a little on the quiet side, and at times seemed a little in her own world. She worked fairly hard at school though, and I won't be surprised if she still puts in a lot of effort into her work as an instagrammer now.. Have a relative that has a mediacorp artiste as their friend so when I go to parties I often see him. Pretty chill irl, no difference from any other guy you‚Äôd meet in the streets.. I know two main types. The topic type eg food bloggers like Leslie Tay and those anime or board game influencers. These people are passionate and love to share about their hobby. They are driven by the love of their hobby or interest. Will continue to work with these type of good humans. 

The second type is the self oriented type. Their interest is in promoting themselves and their brand, beauty and lifestyle. These normally very materialistic and vapid. Never will ever hire them for any PR ever again. Not even as escorts.. A post of him blew up before, a guy who had $34k in front of him with his arms open, teaching you how to get money.

He was a bully and a selfish ass, and I hope he goes bankrupt.. One singer did not make a good impression on my ex‚Äôs brother who‚Äôs a songwriter (or smth along those lines). He said that he pretty much lowballed him for a song he wrote. Same ex dated an actress said that she‚Äôs really hardworking, although very particular about how people perceive her. Especially things like enunciation.

Current bf‚Äôs sister dated a theatre actor, who was extremely supportive of her through tough times. Good guy, with human flaws - only negative thing I heard was that she didn‚Äôt like how flippantly he spent his money. There are some more personal information that I won‚Äôt share, but all I can say is that he‚Äôs very open minded.. I know someone who's a local celebrity in her 20s. We've been good friends since poly and even though I see her once or twice a year it's like nothing has changed. She's quite low key in person and if it weren't for the occasional people asking for photos you'd never guess she was a celebrity.

I also know someone who's much older and was in a very popular local movie in the 90s. He was very much like his character and only more of an insensitive prick on Facebook.. Eh,  my neighbors was an extra who act along side those celebrity count or not? 

Cos he is one of the most friendly person I have known and he was my mom's friend. I don't remember if it was him who intro walkaton to my mom or the other way round. 

But hey, army half marathon can build up enough stamina to tank through. One of TSL's food reviewer videos guys is in my NS coy.

Still quite a pleasant and funny guy, the videos are actually quite close to his usual fun personality.. I've worked with a few influencers. The most professional and pleasant one ended up being the unluckiest because of a scandal she got involved in. Yup, the world isn't fair.. Worked with a beauty and lifestyle vlogger from SEA who interned at my company. She was actually really down to earth (if a little shy and insecure about showing us her video work during her interview), gung ho, and willing to get down and dirty during our in-house video productions. She's also as goofy (and sometimes quite unglam) as her social media portrays her. Still remember the day she was excitedly talking about hitting her first 50K followers during a work day (she's around 500K now). Really proud of what she's achieved tho. :D 

&#x200B;

Then there was another beauty influencer in SG whom I stayed with in the same dorm in uni. We weren't close (more like block mates but acquaintances) but she had killer posture and was a dancer. Used to get teased a bit by the other block mates for her love for this cartoon character which she had a gigantic plushie of (like taking the plushie and hanging it upside down on the clothes rack outside our window IIRC.). A son of a local Malay comedian enlisted alongside me in NS, posted in the same platoon during recruit training and posted in the same department as me until we ORD'd. He's a funny and confident guy despite his size, and even though we never met after we ORD'd, I still think highly about him and wish him all the best in whatever he's doing.. Sadly I only know 1 not so popular celeb irl tht has charted on sg Spotify tht makes music, I myself make music as a hobby(thts how I met him)
He was really good, humble and we helped each other out. now he doesn't even give a fk about listening to my music when I ask him for feedback. Even asked him for help he also didn't wanna help(excuses like oh im too busy) . He was wayy better before he got music onto charts tbh

Honestly ofc I know a few who have like thousands of ig followers(don't know if u consider them ""influencer"" or ""famous"") but I think in my circle of those, they're nice people

Anyways can I hv the thread from askreddit 'am lazy to find. Seen Paige Chua frequently at work and she seems pretty down-to-earth and gorgeous without makeup :). ""i know them but they don't know me."". I know one, though she is not insanely popular. She's seriously just like any normal person and has to work hard for her money... It's not as simple as taking some IG pics and wait for the money to roll in. Being an influencer is actually very very competitive. Probably as competitive as insurance and property agents.. like a Human.. No.. [deleted]. I‚Äôve deal with actual influenza before I agreed with you.. >they care about is how they are portrayed on the photos

People hated on him simply for having a fake accent even though he was talented.. Jace Phua?

Scare me sia I thought you gonna say smth bad abt him.. JJ lin?. Dude that's definitely JJ Lin right. I was in his JC class. Genuinely sweet guy.. How did it even get to 6 digits debt?. Jj lin is that you. Most boring singer... guy... what‚Äôs the name of the construction worker turned singer? Is it him?

Edit: ah du!. Nathan Hartono?. Did he act in a Sg movie before he debuted?. Another SGcafe user ;A;

Every time I see/hear an annoying ass bully from Sec doing badly in life now brings a smile to my face.. BJ?

Can Ho Ching wants everyone to own a HDB flat. Just read title, who cares what she or everyone else wants.. Long overdue policy change.

It never made sense to me why first-time Singapore Citizen couples are unable to purchase a new HDB flat merely on the basis of their income.

Instead, they are forced to subsidise someone else's upgrade by buying a resale flat, or take on a large loan soon after or during periods of heavy capital expenditure such as weddings, honeymoons and having kids.. Walk the talk? Give us [Universal Basic Assets]( Ho Ching cans everyone to own a HDB flat?. Given that most people have pay rises throughout their career which results in a proportion of couples eventually making more than the HDB income ceiling anyway, the more apt line would be

>Why do we penalise those who find love and marry late?. > But why should taxpayers subsidise the well-off?

likely comes with a lot of *

* must be married, Singaporean for the last 20 years, both must be below 30, must contribute to TFR within 3 years, and many more. There's many ways to look at this, one way is if a rich but philanthropic person is allowed to buy a HDB flat, he could donate the excess money he saved from buying a condo, to various charitable organisations.. Tax payers didn‚Äôt subsidize shit. It‚Äôs just market prices being skewed because it‚Äôs all based on resale market. Ie a skewed market with limited supply and higher income buyers as they can‚Äôt qualify for BTOs. Do you think if every single hdb is sold on the market it will fetch the resale price? Just like how coe price is set by the lowest bidder if all flats were allowed to be sold on the free market I‚Äôm quite sure it should be near where hdb is selling or even lower because even new launches have empty units.. She owns Singapore bodoh. We need a decent amount of space for indecent acts too. Ho Ching wants everyone to own a HDB can. Exactly I know some potential high flyers who eventually became high flyers who married early and got that sweet gahmen grant despite being quite guaranteed to be rich later on.  But I also know some average workers who married late and at a point in their career where they just crossed the threshold as husband and wife. 

That average middle income Singaporean is subsidizing the former high flying couple who married early.

The issue is that plenty of the people who review either suck at reviewing, knows jack-shit about the products they talk about, or they're sponsored by the company they're told to review, and they're being bias, either because they feel they'll go out of business for talking crap on the product or the company low key tells them don't talk bad about their products.

17,Does aftershock really have a good reputation for warranty claims?,dlbc5p,2019-10-22 02:33:15,"I got this aftershock PC (an expensive one, mind you) last month in september,and used it in the weekends when I did have the time to spend playing some games and doing weekend work. Its a desktop PC.

However last sunday while I was doing work on the computer there was a crackling sound from the glass of the AFTERSHOCK pc - this NZXT H500i .When I took a look at it, the glass was cracked with the spidering effect.( glass wasnt cracked when I bought it). Soon the entire glass panel shattered and the bits went to the floor.

I called aftershock for a glass replacement, but they would not let me claim warranty because they ""do not know if the glass was cracked due to manufacturing error or if I purposely broke it"" and assumed it was a user's error, claiming an addtional 50$ for the glass panel.

They also asked me to take a picture and send it to them as if the shattered glass will prove whether it is the manufacturing error or my error.

This behaviour from the support staff at AFTERSHOCK is very disasspointing. I have heard good reviews all round from reviews online and from friends, and this experience really sours the (misguided?) Trust with the company.

Should I go down to the retail store and attempt again to claim my warranty? The person on the other end claimed he was new there. Or should I hold my peace and accept the fact that I actually am the devil's incarnate and destroy my own stuff?

Pls advise.

Edit: just gave them a call, and their reply was

 ""everything is covered under the warranty, EXCEPT for the tempered glass.""

TLDR: PC just after a month use ( and only on weekends) has a defect and AFTERSHOCK does not let me claim warranty. 
#Aftershock #Warranty #fail #nowarranty",0,0.44,35.0,"Dont hashtag here bruh. They are crap, DIY from Sim Lim is a better experience imo. Aftershock is terrible in my opinion. My friend laptop first day cannot boot up after using awhile on the first day.. They're not rejecting the warranty claim outright, they're asking for a picture to prove it's broken. 

If it is broken and they submit the picture to NZXT, most likely NZXT will approve a free side panel replacement  and Aftershock will get it repaired for you. 

They need the picture to prove it's broken otherwise people would just claim willy-nilly to get free side panels even if theirs are fine.. you overpaid for their warranty, better use it. Sounds like typical Singapore customer service.. i would strongly suggest you go down their retail shop, show them your laptop.. 2 of my new desktop fans stopped working after a few months.. Been using an aftershock laptop for about 3 years now. Took it in to their HQ at Bendemeer twice, first when the fan stopped working because I dented the laptop case and second when my monitor kept having vertical lines appear. Both occurred within warranty time frame and repaired without any further expense even though technically the fan issue is user damage.

In my opinion, just take the picture so they can escalate it to the people who can actually decide if this is a warranty repair or not. Otherwise bring the PC into the Bendemeer HQ where the bosses and repair crew are and escalate it there.. Both my custom pc and laptop were from aftershock. I buy from them because i always had a great experience with their customer service. I guess i can understand where the customer service rep was coming from, seeing that this is a very rare incident. Maybe u should go down to their office and explain to them what happened. Although it might be a bit difficult to claim warranty imo.. I've used 4 brands the last 6 years, can totally say warranty means nothing, they pretty much only react when you're attach with company premiums.

There's so many unwritten ways to void of warranty. Quoted 2k at the SC, repaired 120 at SLS.

Already give up on after sales services and warranty.. I bought two PC on two different occasion from aftershock and both came delivered with some sort of issue. Same as you, they requested for pictures of the problem and got back to me within the day and they did honor their warranty. I would say that their after sale service is not that bad

I suggest you make a call directly for faster response and clarification. Lol my brother bought a aftershock PC as he was too lazy to DIY. 

Received it and it booted... and stopped working after a week or two. 

Called them to fix and the technician never turned up. When my brother called again, they said the case was apparently not entered into the system. They finally sent a guy down to collect the PC back, after the guy failed to fix on the spot. 

After about 2 weeks of waiting, he called again, and they said they never got his PC lol. 

After some checking on their end, they ‚Äúfound‚Äù the PC and took their time to fix it. 

Took them a month or so to rectify the problem..  I own an aftershock laptop too, have it for about 5 years now, still working okay. When it first came, the display ports weren't working and I had to get it repaired. The staff that came were alright people and didn't ask too many questions
After that, personally I find that the touch pad was rough and not very responsive, the screen was yellowish... I just continued using and told myself I wont buy laptops without trying them in future.. They did a 1 for 1 exchange for a new laptop, despite being it out of warranty. But I had to send it down countless times in the past year. 

They aren't the best, but the bar isn't that high to begin with.

And tbh, if your glass didnt crack when you got the PC, there is no reason for it to start cracking on it's own, unless it got hit.. I think this is just confirmation bias. 1 friend‚Äôs laptop has manufacture problem and you say aftershock is terrible. My laptop is working fine, 3 other friends‚Äô desktop is working fine after years of purchase. Did he get any replacement/ repairs done after that? Claiming warranty. This wasnt the line that the support staff gave though. They wanted me to straight up pay in full for a new glass piece. This option of the submission  to NZXT was not mentioned then.. They are not letting me claim the warranty. Thats the issue.. Its a desktop computer, but i think id bring it down nonetheless.. Yup! Sounds like i got a "" lemon"" support staff there. i have sent a strongly worded email with pictures, so fingers crossed it can get replaced.. Same here, ive always heard good things about their customer service. A friend spilled his coffee on a laptop and damaged his motherboard, but warranty could still be claimed. Another dropped his laptop and cracked his screen, got replaced without any complaints. 

Hence i was willing to spend a large amount of money to buy an aftershock product. But this experience makes me wonder if I was wrong or the good service was only to the laptops.. Called them directly, they told me EVERYTHING ELSE was under warranty except for the glass. Because their staff handles ""thousands of pcs everyday and this is due to user fault"" and proceeded to tell me that the replacement fee is 50 dollars..  They send guys down to check the system?. Seems like laptop repairs are more friendly than the PC staff. Reminder never to get a pc from aftershock again.. Google tempered glass cracking suddenly

Yeah i know, thats the issue.
If your laptop was working when you got it, theres also no reason for it to stop working right?. Just to add on my friend laptop subsequently also have alot of problem.. Thats my opinion.. From my understanding he went to send it back for repair.. > They also asked me to take a picture and send it to them as if the shattered glass will prove whether it is the manufacturing error or my error.

So they only gave you the option of buying a new panel but asked you to submit a picture anyway? That doesn't make sense.. There‚Äôs a delivery service back to aftershock as well. 

Think my brother made enough noise, so much so that they sent a tech down. But, the tech said there was disassembly required as a component was faulty or something. 

So had to send it back to aftershock to fix.. For electronics, there are many root causes for it to fail, overheating, loose connection, etc. By right a new laptop should not fail off the bat.

But like you said, if the glass suddenly broke on its own, there was probably a pre existing crack somewhere which propagated to a big one, leading to the failure of the glass. To whom the fault lies with is hard to track. 

At least for my case, as I didn't touch the internals nor overclock, but for yours, its not clear cut.. I would understand that there may be some problems but to reject the warranty claim outright boggles my mind. If your friend did get it replaced then at least warranty is working unlike mine. Yeah, which is my point exactly. So I did ask him how the picture will help with the case, and he couldnt give me a proper reply.. Yeah but aftershock is claiming that all the costs of damages are on the user and not on the company.

Didnt even open the desktop. No overclock, used it for work and some games.",1327.0,10,304,1

Edit: dumbass forgot a key word. It's like monkeys and typewriters. If you spew out enough bullshit, eventually something got to be correct.. car workshop. This but unironically. Holy shit guys we found the driver. What is this 1 year old bot account with no other post to its name?? Jeez this is so weird.. George Carlin: ""Religion is bullshit. That's why everytime you heard a good bullshit story, you shout: HOLY SHIT!"". Singapore plate, its registered as a work vehicle from an old scheme that gives them immunity from being scrapped after 20 yrs. No it's definitely not Australian, Aussie plates have the state name at the top or bottom.

I'm 99% certain that's a Singaporean vehicle, the font looks like it.. ~~It's a Malaysian plate. KL to be precise.~~

[Edit] sorry, I was wrong on this. I've a friend who strongly believes that Trump is innocent, Obama is the devil-incarnate, and global warming is a hoax. And that 9/11 was a ploy by Jews to skew public perception of Muslims.

We don't talk anymore.. > American pickup trucks

*Dangerously lifted* American pickup trucks with enormous tires that can fit a Camry underneath it. Also has super bright spotlights/light bar, likes to hog the fast lane, and probably has a MAGA bumper sticker.. Ah so des!

Thanks for the info!. Please tell me he pasted it on as a joke. A broken clock is still right twice a day.. Only a stuck one. An improperly set clock will never be correct.. Tbh I think there's many who believe that 9/11 was a false flag attack. Throwaway account for controversial comments. Given the age of the vehicle, I would say it is a Singapore plate. W-plate is currently only used for engineering plants (mobile cranes, cement pumps etc) but last time you can register off-road vehicles under W-plate too. 

If it was a KL vehicle, it would be unlikley to have a Singapore speed limit sticker.. Nope. Its a singaporean plate. Like we used to do. I have been watching Singaporean‚Äôs in a fb group trying to convince everyone climate change is a hoax and just being used by leftist to enrich themselves and the planet is fine.

 I just stay to watch how far the rabbit hole goes. Unfortunately, no... but he‚Äôs a nice guy, weird world views though!. I'm not into conspiracy theories but if you think logically, for 911 to happen, the terrorists had to have everything going right for them to pull off the attack successfully without any insiders' information. How did they know there would be an unprecedented large scale military exercise going on that day that pulled all operational ready fight jets away from reaching them in time? The US has the two largest Airforce in the world. US Airforce and US navy. Not a single operational ready fighter jets that day.. But why? Reddit karma isn't important. Unless your account is known and you don't want your peers knowing you're a 9/11 conspiracy believer.. Thanks for the clarification. Shows how long I've been gone for..... Cause now we got bad blood. Is it the Singapore Skeptics Group or something? And is it by a Henry Chew and his fellow Libertarians are leading this valiant charge against this nefarious plot by leftist?. How are leftists supposed to enrich themselves from the climate change hoax?

Also, in what way could it possibly be bad (except through personal inconvenience) to try and live a bit more sustainably?. My condolences.. Yes and yes although Henry chew has been banned but there are still the other Libertarians inside circle jerking each other.",1694.0,5,1,1
19,I'm an NSF applying to local universities for the next academic year. Which degrees/courses are most relevant in Singapore in today's socioeconomic environment?,dla9bw,2019-10-22 01:09:04,"At this point in life I do not have a real passion for any particular subject/field and I have no real strength in any subject as well. So, I can't decide based on interests and/or strengths.",0,0.35,25.0,"Courses that are relevant to today‚Äôs needs are not only popular and oversubscribed with high entry requirements, they also require high level of passion, interest and commitment to get a decent grade outcome. 

We actually get these sort of broad questions from parents and we have to point out that the kid‚Äôs academic qualification generally rules him or her out from most courses. No issues with the better qualified ones as they seem to know where they are heading. 

Sometimes NS distracts us from our academic pursuits. One option is to meetup with your NS peers who are going into Uni to get their views.. sign on. If I tell you computing and then the computing bubble burst will you blame me?

TBH, you really have to find what you really like instead of just relying on the starting salary.. youtuber. Engineering will probably get you a job, though it is usually underappreciated and the pay is just avg. For reference, a month of pay is about 3-4.5k, second upper class is about 3.7k. 

It depends on your interest, will be useful if you can give us more information. I too didnt have an interest, and i just took eee and mae in poly and uni respectively. Now i have to live with it, so i would say try to do something you enjoy doing.

Psa, engineering can get you to other industry too.. ""Most relevant"" sounds like you just want the most valued major for a decent job. If earning is your goal, I recommend going to work straight instead to have a foot in early. While majors seem important, the only ones worth going are technical knowledge based for specific occupations, and even those have no guarantee of a good pay. The best jobs in the future are not created today, and with skill sets being more volatile majors aren't as decisive on future careers as before.. Well, Singapore is going to spend the next 100 years trying to avoid getting flooded, so civil engineering.. how about you not apply, take a year out to work and see the real world before you decide on what you want to do. choosing a course of study based on job security is nothing wrong but there is no guarantee that it will be stable and that you'll be happy.

choose something that you're interested in and will motivate you everyday when you go to work.

the world changes so quickly that no one, even educators can predict what kind of jobs will be like by the time you graduate. 

to answer your question, degrees that have a high barrier to entry always good. if the industry is protected (meaning it can't be outsourced nor replaced by a cheaper FT, or simply protected by the Govt) like Law or Medicine, they may be worth checking out. Automation will make some of these jobs obsolete though. Best if you take your time and choose rather than rush into it blindly. If you're in NS you can always ask your female ex classmates on their experience in Uni too, especially if they're in the course you want.. Do what you are good at. Interest is a good indicator if you might be good at something.

Don't try and do something just because the field pays well.

Because you will suck at it, people will know it and call your BS, and you will be kicked out with no relevant skills anywhere at all.. If you dont have any real passion or strength then id suggest taking the time in NS to really think out your future. Teaching.. History.. anything related to the digital economy, ICT (info-comm tech). 

data analysts/scientists, programmers for example.. U cannot decide base on what is relevant now in the society or the market. Spend the 2 years in NS finding your passion, everyone has a strength and passion in something, you just haven't explored enough or gave up from the get go. 

Nothing good is going to happen if u get into a course u have no interest for. Dont ruin other people's life lol. Just like me studying life sciences only for the bubble to burst haha. I wonder if it's really happening though. IT and tech companies are wildly hiring fresh grads with minimal/no programming background. Code monkeys of every species seem to be in great demand.. How bad could it really be if the computing bubble burst? Nothing is certain in this day and age but 7-8 years from now, computing seems safer than lets say engineering or life science etc.. Just curious what made you switch courses to mae from eee? Currently doing eee in poly as well and not entirely too sure about my future. (Heard EEE is basically the hardest engineering course in uni but super underappreciated locally). Except for arts degree, I think most local degree can get you that pay or better.. That's the problem. I can't really think it out. I can't find any purpose in life.. okay mah sign on. who knows can get into air force or navy. provided that op isnt malay. Well if you are good you will rise up, if you are shit when the bubble pops, GLHF. The bubble always pops. I hop because i dont wanna do circuit designs and see power circuits etc.

So i was stuck with engineering and since there isnt any clean energy module at that time i decided to try mae since it is a ""common"" engineering which i can get job anywhere. 

Eee is hard in uni, mae is also hard. >(Heard EEE is basically the hardest engineering course in uni but super underappreciated locally)

Not true, a lot of EEE grads go on to other industries because they're appreciated there. Ironically they're only underappreciated in the field they're supposed to go into i.e. electrical engineering and hardware engineering.",974.0,23,36,1

Just a note -- iOS users may have trouble viewing this article unless they update to iOS13. Just a heads up :--). You can actually find their graves at Kranji Memorial.. So what happened to the Malays who were brought to Australia after their junk was captured?. Yep, that was the earlier Jaywick mission where they coated themselves with dark paint to disguise as Malays.

Here they kinda did the same, but their hair and eyes also raised a bit of suspicion as well.... Brownface! Triggered! /s. Probably an unpopular opinion, but I dislike news or article sites where they make snazzy graphics to make it look more interactive.

For me a well written article > interactive articles.

The worst being those where they take long to load.. Wow I know you warned us, but I wasn‚Äôt prepared for how unoptimised that site was.

Pretty snazzy presentation nevertheless.. Lmao is it even safe to update to ios13. One or two sources say they were held as POWs (*which is a tad fkn extreme like bruh I'm out fishing one day next minute I'm a prisoner*), but most just say they stayed in Australia until the end of the war/until Japan left Southeast Asia. Which, in retrospect, does kinda feel like they were held as POWs or something, but I can't be *too sure* on how they were treated.. It seems also they may not had the best Intel for this mission.

I mean after all they trusted locals to provide Intel rather than having someone on location to feed Intel back to the base. Its very risky because like what's mentioned, locals could give in for money instead.. Yeah...we had problems with iOS constantly, and in fact had to delay releasing the article simply cause iOS before this wasn't compatible with the tool we used until the latest update.. Looks real good on desktop though. Liked the map and route markers. And the amount of research needed to pull this off.

Pity about the iOS. Hang in there.. What tool is it?. ArcGIS Storymaps. I personally didn't do up the maps (a friend did), but I've used ArcGIS in my uni course. Quite good to use if ya know yr shit, but as shown, can be a burden on some computers.. fucking arcgis. Makes planning exercises on ICT so fucking difficult.

Most probably due to some heart condition they told me I have even though I occasionally run 2.4km or go jogging without any issues.(I should probably find out more about this)

So, what should I expect for my upcoming NS? Any people who experienced similar situation?",25,0.79,63.0,"Most probably office admin work. 9am-6pm kind of job and you don't need to stay in camp. Source: I was PES E.. hope u get mindef clerk, pes e9 here too and I am watching netflix / napping everyday because I literally have nothing to do. While everyone will be familiarize themselves with SAR21 & M203, etc, you will be well-versed in Daikin & Fuji-Xerox. 8-5 or even 3pm stayout admin clerk. Indent forks and spoons yea thats probably it. Remember to bring jacket as aircon might be cold. Congratulations! Just curious, this heart condition is mafan syndrome? You should check it out just in case as I know of people who were misdiagnosed.. lepak bro. your bmt is at kranji camp 2, stay-in for 9 weeks (4 weeks of basic soldiering, 5 weeks of vocation training)

now, pes e9 is more than just admin clerk. you can be a transport operator or whatsoever. Got to stayout.Lots of admin time first 4 weeks. E9 don't have gun handling,grenade throwing and swimming. Most E9s will be ASA. Next 5 weeks will be vocation training , mostly lesson. 
The 8-5 depends on which unit you are posted to,  some might get night or weekend duty. You stuck lottery... Just count your lucky stars and don't rub it in.... Enjoy your stay out life. 2years good life. BMT will be at Kranji Camp 2(Walk from yew tee mrt). Consists of 9 weeks enhanced bmt, of which 4 weeks are basic soldiering(live firing,grenade throwing,imt,""mock outfield"",etc), followed by 5 weeks of vocational exercise(at this point you'll know your vocation for your remaining NS life).

Enhanced BMT isn't very tough compared to actual BMT in Tekong for sure, but it still serves as a foundation for your NS journey.

Being PES E9, you'll be in a support vocation, such as Transport operator (driver), medic, Security trooper, Supply assistant, ASA, Navy/airforce admin,etc. Do note that under this support vocation you will also be classifed under ""service"", for example ""Service Transport Operator"" for driving, meaning you wont be driving bigger vehicles like the 5 and 6 tonner.

P.s. You prob wont get to do live firing and grenade throwing as PES E is excused, so you'll probably have more admin time than the PES Cs. You will however get to participate in the IMT tho.. Make sure to make use of the free medical services.. Given a choice, I would rather have a healthy heart and go through a soldiering life than have a heart condition admin NS life.

That having said, like others mentioned, you'll basically dont have to sweat it out during your NS.. You‚Äôll probably end up as a security trooper. Boring job depending on where you get posted to. Might need to stay in, 2 days in 2 days out. 

Source: was one.. E9L9 here. What does your card specifically say? No overnight stay? No handling of firearms?

Most likely you'll just get a role that will let you go home every day. Automatic promotion based on time spent in service- at the end, you should ORD as a Corporal. 

My case was really special so I don't know if it'll be helpful to you, but I was basically stationed at a civilian company to work like a regular office worker. I only wore my uniform maybe 5-6 times. Never went to Tekong, just showed up at CMPB on the date they specified, got sworn in, and then carted off to the company. My experience was very far removed from being militant.

I think E9ers get varying roles and treatment, so I'm sorry if my experience isn't helpful. But dude, get your heart checked out. Sounds serious.. No IPPT too. The good life. I was on the exact same boat as you, graded PES E9L9 out of the blue and i was actually quite upset. Turns out it was a blessing. Was appointed as an ASA (stayout) and my NS was literally 2 years of vacation. Damn shiok.. Enjoy your NS life. Was E9L9, in my NS days BMT was a 1 week stay at Tekong, then was posted to MINDEF as a ASA. I‚Äôll say your experience will be very dependent on where you‚Äôre posted to.. Expect a lot of saikang work to do after you finish your BMT. Pray you won't get kena finance clerk because that job is a shithole.. Your outfield in bmt would be awesome. 

My friend went for it and had to ‚Äúdig‚Äù shellscrape (which half the company didn‚Äôt do) and set up the tent. 

Mentally preparing himself for a night in the tent, they were then told to pack up and go training shed to sleep. Experienced some minor discomfort from the hard floor.. pes e now need to stay in but during bmt phase. Former mindef clerk here - did a lot of work :(. Good life man. Former mindef clerk too, why you so lepak one.. This should be top comment. Hahahaha very true. I‚Äôm sure being an ASA, your knowledge of the office set up and office appliances will increase
Speaking from current experience btw üòã. Thanks for your contribution to this discussion, but I have a question. What do you mean by 3pm stayout admin clerk?. Marfan Syndrome. Hearing that reminds me of the late Edmond Branson Jr. Super funky drummer in sg. He passed away in 2004 from complications related to this. He was only 36. Way too soon.. Idk man, I totally forgot what the doctor said but he did told me something like a condition that is related to the heart. I forgot the name man, shit.

But I do know the reason for the diagnosis is due to my inconsistent heartbeat, which the doctor said I have an average of 25% more heartbeats than the average person. Also, the heartbeat is throughout 24/7, which means I have more heartbeats during my everyday lives even when sleeping. Basically my heartbeat is too much I think, I think they afraid I might have difficulty breathing if I do the normal NS stuffs.

Also, the doctor already set an appointment for me during NS to come back and go through a minor treatment using some electricity to set my heartbeat to normal rate.. I was one of those. I have mass phenotype though, which is a extremely similar condition. 'mafan syndrome' LOL. Drivers had it pretty tough IIRC. That was a bunch of stress they were under.. Unless they changed the PES rules, E9 can't be a driver IIRC 

Minimum was C2L9. C9 onwards can't be driver. At least back in circa 2011. most of my security troopers are A/B1 tho... NDP website development ah?. My BMT period I had to stay in for 2 weeks (?). Now I heard that PES E BMT is longer than that.. [deleted]. Stay out means you‚Äôre not required to stay overnight in camp

Admin clerk means doing administrative duties (paper work, excel etc)

3pm + stay out + admin clerk = go home at 3pm after a day of typing duties. Better to be safe than sorry. 

Sounds like a pacemaker implant? Either way, it‚Äôs good that you are doing it during your NS, cos it will be fully covered. 

2 years very fast. Just serve and fuck off fast fast.. Arrhythmia? Better get it resolved within the 2 years so all medical costs are subsidised!. Well, Marfan Syndrome is a bit mafan, after all ;). they changed the ruling. pes e, even e9, can be a driver now. few of my sectionmates are currently training to be drivers and they are e9. Idk if I‚Äôve ever heard pes e troopers... I don't want to say, because privacy and stuff. If you're really curious, PM me and i'll tell you!. yup, 9 weeks now. 4 weeks of basic soldiering and 5 weeks of vocational training. Woh woh woh too much info dude. I not sure what you can say and whatchiew cannot say ah.. Better play it safe?

Permanently wear jacket one, inside. Forever cold. Is the yong tau foo auntie still selling stuff with her imba memory?. There's such thing as go home at 3PM? 

My coy had some E9 clerks too but the encik was adament of them staying during working hours 8-6.. Given his heart condition, I don't think he would be posted to become a driver. I'm sure it's a case by case basis.. Huh, when was it changed? I don't remember any PES E people getting posted to train to drive anything. It really depends on the camp, there are quite a lot of PES E troopers in many camps around Singapore.. They're service troopers, not trained to hold rifle so can only do Pass Office / PAC / VAC.. Depends on whether stay in or not. E9 most likely stay out. If CMPB MO say stay out, then you are stay out BMT and unit.. lol good point and yea she is but closing down soon in like 2 months for renovation :(. I know of people ending earlier than 3, somewhat regularly at least. Not exactly E9 clerk but it's still office environment. I have ended days early too, but where I am people typically end at 5.

On the other hand, contrary to what some may think, office =/= heaven. Sometimes true, but not 100%. Some friends got the short end of the stick and have a very poor working environment/culture, I think I have it pretty decent, and then some even better. There's still a spectrum.. yup, it's case by case basis. i'm just telling that e9 recruits can now possibly be drivers and other vocations that suit pes e status, not just admin clerk

(edited). not sure when, but my sectionmates are currently being trained to drive. Almost every camp has PES E troopers now. Don‚Äôt hold guns or do patrols, just verifying entry.. during my e9 bmt phase , about 20 were stays out while the rest stays in. however, this also depends on your med condition. Aw. But then what all the clerks eat sia if close? Or only her stall ah?. 2 types of drivers: service TOs and TOs. Transport operators drive the tonners and big vehicles, class 4 licence. STOs can be pes E, normally drive stuff such as smaller vehicles, ammo carriers, shuttle buses etc.. Can confirm. Due to shortage of manpower‚Äôs , suitable Pes E soldiers can be deployed as a Service Driver i.e driving purely class 3 vehicles only.. the whole lvl 1 closing, at least still got cai fan, western and that stall beside vegeterian",1754.0,6,63,1

Issue is, the bus stop nearest to me is a 15min walk from my house and then when I alight, it's a 10min walk again.

Do you guys think the $4 fare is worth it and how will I know whether the bus will have seats? Also, how can I check bus timings/cancellations? Does it have it's own app or website?

Looking forward to your insights!",0,0.56,12.0,"I for one use this service to commute to work everyday and here are my thoughts

It is extremely convenient as the bus passes the nearest bus stop from me and I am aware of the intervals the buses comes to my stop

For someone who lives directly above the bus stop I typically still head down 5 mins to buffer because the
bus arrival timing heavily depends on traffic.
There are instances where the bus arrives ahead of schedule and if you didn't manage to catch it the next one will likely be 20 mins later

The $4 is worth it because you most likely will get a seat and you don't have to deal with the crowds. With the bus taking the expressways and dropping me off right where I work, easily 30 mins saved on travelling

This service is good for those living near to the bus stops  because although the service is reliable, no one can tell for sure if the bus has passed your stop. 
I have to keep a look out for familiar faces that takes the same bus with me to know I haven't missed my bus 

If I miss the bus, I'll already be late even if I manage to take the second one because of the interval it comes at.

For you to take a 15 min walk to your bus stop with the premium service and add a 5 mins buffer while paying $4 might seem a bit tedious 

Because ultimately this service should be helping to make your commute more enjoyable and relaxing at a bit of a price.. Why don't you try it for a few days and see what whether it is worth paying 4 bucks?. It is worth it even if you have to stand since there is no walking involved

My transport app shld have the timings

There are no cancellations but limited timings on holidays or eves (the driver will usually tell you). Where do you travel to?. This is the exact piece of advice and info I was looking for. Thanks kind stranger!. Yeah man! Then I'll share my experience on this thread in case someone is curious about it as well.. You have a point. Maybe I'll give it a go tomorrow. Henderson Road. Quite near to Bukit Merah Bus Interchange. Cool, I mean at the end of the day, people are willing to pay for different levels of service.

I bought a car to make it easier to get to work. Some people may think it's stupid and a waste of money, but I like driving and I can get to work without sweating and in 30-35 mins (instead of 1hr 30mins). To me it was money well-spent and I get to use it for other stuff on the weekends. True that! To each his/her own. Now I'm just kind of experimenting with different ways of getting to and from work. Since I've always lived at Bedok and rarely go to the North-East, it all seems like a foreign land to me haha. My friends take NE Line to vivo and changes bus.

I do like wandering around those places but I can see why someone with a limited time in Singapore would skip out in favour of more specific tourist spots.. Tampines Eco Green is lovely!

> Singapore's plans to tackle climate change will include nature-based solutions such as restoring its mangrove areas and planting thousands of trees, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said yesterday.

> While it has mentioned engineering options before, this is the first time the Government has officially said that nature-based solutions to deal with climate change are on the cards.

> Mr Masagos underscored the seriousness of the threat posed by climate change, calling it an existential challenge that nations could not afford to ignore. ""Otherwise, citizens will take their cause to the streets and reason will fail to rule,"" he said, in his strongest comments on the subject to date.

> Speaking at the first Singapore meeting of scientists from the United Nations' climate science body, Mr Masagos added: ""We take both hard and soft engineering approaches to mitigate coastal erosion, and (will) actively restore our mangrove areas.""

> He said nature-based solutions will also go beyond coastal protection. He cited the over two million trees in Singapore, as well as its more than 350 parks and four nature reserves.

> Mr Masagos said: ""Under the Forest Restoration Action Plan, an additional 250,000 native trees and shrubs will be planted.

> ""The benefits are multi-fold: This will support our biodiversity and, importantly, further drive climate mitigation and strengthen our resilience.""

> In August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said in his National Day Rally speech that the Republic was looking into engineering works to buffer the country against rising sea levels.

> Among the strategies being examined were empoldering, a land reclamation technique, along Singapore's eastern coast, as well as reclaiming a series of offshore islands there, PM Lee said then.

> Related Story Climate of Change: Special reports by ST correspondents

> Related Story Nations must not take eyes off climate change or citizens will take their cause to the streets: Masagos

> Related Story How El Nino affected Singapore

> His speech had led some scientists to ask if Singapore would also consider nature-based solutions.

> Experts backed the new approach outlined in Mr Masagos' speech yesterday.

> Associate Professor Daniel Friess, a mangrove expert with the National University of Singapore's geography department, said mangroves have the potential to keep pace with some rates of sea-level rise - making them a natural and adaptable coastal defence that can help prevent rising seas from inundating coastlines.

> Prof Friess said while there are a number of areas where mangroves have been lost, there is a chance of bringing them back to areas such as Pulau Ubin, an island off Singapore's north-eastern coast.

> He added: ""We can also think about new areas where we can grow mangroves in novel ways, for example, by designing future developments and reclamations that allow mangrove growth.""

> The Straits Times had earlier reported that land in Singapore changed from being a net absorber of carbon in 2012 to a net emitter in 2014, as forests made way for settlements.

Though I'm not very sure there's a substantial SG audience for that game.. Doubt there‚Äôs an established group, tho I‚Äôm rather fortunate to have friends who play the same game as I do.

Problem is, they‚Äôre really good and I‚Äôm a casual... if I‚Äôm playing with them in a ranked matches I‚Äôll be fucked to high heaven. There's 5SSP. first few links on Google. It started off with MechWarrior Online but now branches out to several random games. 

It ain't a big community, can have a look if you want. üòä. I play LoL, I wonder if there is a mature age group for that game?. discord shld be the best option and comunity. There‚Äôs a don‚Äôt starve together group on telegram about 40 members.. There is a Wmmt group on telegram based in sg. sup. Hardwarezone. I'm a level 99 Mob boss in Mob City. I guess thats how the Mafia works.. its not just singapore, its a global issue.. i know right, the games overridden with kids nowadays. oh cool. am interested.  


you got a link?. yea i stopped playing years ago, but im still heavily invested in the LoL pro scene. Hmm I guess I can be considered the same. I used to play a ton from 2010 (Pre-Garena) to 2014 (Season 4). Quit after that but still watch the major stuff time to time when its on like worlds, All-stars etc.

I'm surprised SKT and Faker is still on top of the game while the other names have kinda faded away like TSM, TPA etc.

Most of the korean teams that I follow are gone too like CJ, Najin,. Yea the talents in the scene is really crazy. New players keep popping up out of nowhere from amatuer scene and doing really well. 2 out of 3 of the korean teams at worlds are mostly made up of rookies.

Only a few players manage to stay on top after many years (Faker, Rekkles, Doublelift etc. ). These are the players that should be known as real legends of the game.",427.0,7,50,1
26,Freqeunt china travellers I need your help!,dl89r4,2019-10-21 22:41:12,"Going to china soon and wondering if i could set up wechatpay /alipay to use there. 

I understand you need a china number and bank acc to do that. As a foreigner who also speaks chinese, is it possible to get these 2 things done when I get there?

I would also like to know if a sg debit/credit unionpay card works for adding your card to alipay/wechat pay in china so I can use their mobile payment system

Also heard you can pass someone cash and get them to transfer money to your wallet but seems to be a little troublesome as you have to keep doing it to top up. 

Would appreciate any other related advice. Thanks!",5,0.77,17.0,"Foreign cards can be added to both Alipay/Wechat but they are severely limited in who/what they can pay, mostly merchants only, as well as you won‚Äôt be able to transfer funds out to yourself or another person. 

Bank account requires proof of residency/work visa these days so that‚Äôs a challenge for short term visitors. A mobile line is relatively easy to get, just go to any of the mobile customer service centers. 

Alternatively you could just use ApplePay/GooglePay for payments which is the easier option.. If it is for a short trip (no need long term solution) and you have a Chinese friend, you can ask them to arrange the Relative Card (‰∫≤Â±ûÂç°) function which is essentially ""you scan, they pay"" which allows people without Chinese bank accounts to use the full Wechat pay functions. It's for immediate relatives only in principle but they don't check anything so you just have to make your friend your temporary new parent for the trip lol. 

It's kind of a pain but you will be extremely limited over there without at least one form of electronic payment so worth thinking about.. No, for wechatpay you need to link it to a bank account opened in China. Hence, you are excluded from using it.

Your next alternative is a UnionPay card. DVD has one debit card.. Just a note that you can't get people to top up your account any more. I was able to do that 2 years ago, but wechat stopped allowing it from last year.. sg number works fine for registering an account. my SO used his sg number for opening his alipay account. tho i linked it to my own Chinese ID and bank acc.

ive seen expats in China using alipay without any trouble so foreign pprt should be able to be used to verify your acc. linking it to credit/debit card work too as long as your bank allows oversea transactions. but credit cards might not work in certain merchandise like small local eateries since owners might not want to pay for extra service fees.

Edit: oops just looked it up online clearly you'd have to link your alipay acc to a chinese bank card first before you link it to foreign cards .  [link here.]( Just a word of caution, if you are using a temporary Chinese mobile line and tie it to your WeChat/Alipay/bank account with no way to top up regularly, you could lose the line which will complicate matters. A stranger might end up accessing your accounts.. You can't just open a bank account there as a foreigner




DBS has a debit union pay card. Foreigner coming in r/sg to ask about question involving China. LOL  


I'm actually impressed no one in here is triggered yet. Isn't google banned in china?. >You can add foreign debit and credit cards here too, but to add funds into your Alipay balance you‚Äôll need to add the Chinese one first. 

Adding a foreign card only is possible but you're restricted to paying merchants where the exact amount is deducted and only from a credit card, debit cards usually aren't allowed.

Linking a Chinese card/bank account is specifically so users can top up or withdraw money from the Alipay account balance.. Any idea if the unionpay card can be used to add card for wechat/alipay? I heard that you need a onshore mainland acc for that. Sg resident asking about China cause they'll be a foreigner there.

I'm actually impressed that you're the only one that didn't get it.. Foreign to China la.. Ummm, the digital wallet system on android phones is known as GooglePay? Samsung just has its own version with SamsungPay but I needed to generalise the phone ecosystem?

Also, the Google search engine is blocked in China but Google still has offices in China that still predominantly provide services for Chinese companies trying to tap the international market for things like GoogleAds and other services.. I think for ailipay you can use a Singapore bank account, not sure 


But for wechat you for sure need a Chinese bank account. I saw that on 2nd reading after the first guy pointed it out.

27,Why do I always feel like I'm an underachiever in Singapore?,dl662i,2019-10-21 20:11:28,"Some background, I'm a student taking my O's this year in a neighborhood school. My results are comparatively great in that school but when I compare it to other schools I begin to realize the intellectual divide.",37,0.81,57.0,"There will always be a mountain bigger than you... And grades alone don't decide your success. For example I had good grades in uni but I ain't doing shit right now.

Also O levels are nothing more than a foot note once you get your tertiary education and first job. It's just the first of many many steps.

The only person you should be comparing yourself to is the you from yesterday. Everyone else has different priorities, situations and genetics in life.. ‰∫∫ÊØî‰∫∫ÔºåÊ∞îÊ≠ª‰∫∫„ÄÇ ÂºÄÂøÉÂ∞±Â•Ω„ÄÇ. Do you want to be a shark in a small pond or a fish in a big pond?. If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans... from Desiderata. My younger brother is from Hwa Chong, while I'm from a neighborhood school. I'm currently in a Poly while he is destined to go into a JC. The unrealistic expectations my parents placed on me 'because I'm the eldest son' during O levels really demoralized me. Imagine having an intellectual divide in your own home, it doesn't end well.

&#x200B;

I totally feel you, but please, don't compare yourself with the others. Focus on the rest of your O level papers you studied for, and aim to get into a good JC/Poly. O levels is just a stepping stone towards your tertiary education, don't beat up yourself over it.. Just enjoy your time in the neigbourhood school. You might  not cope in other schools becuase they are so competitive over there„ÄÇ Did you read the thread about not studying hard in school some redditors were bemoaning they studied too hard and never enjoyed themselves?

Find a passion outside school like coding or something that gets you up early in the morning to accomplish. That's achievement right there.. Word of advice is to never compare yourself to others. Just do the best you can and constantly feedback yourself if you think you can do better. 

Just know that if you feel inferior to the geniuses of the world, someone else may be comparing themselves to you and feel the same way too.. if u spend your life comparing yourself to others, you will always be miserable. If you have a competitive nature, no amount of achievement will make you feel satisfied. Even if you're at the pinnacle of your field, there are other fields you'll be relatively worse off in, and there'll be peers who do something better than you. You need to find peace with yourself at some point... but even then, the feeling never entirely goes away.. Erm, You sound very kiasu, not tht it's bad but comparing yourselves to others isn't worth the time(even tho I do it myself sometimes tbh). O Level only. If you feel inferior now, wait till you see your competitors at university.. Don't compare yourself to those ""elite"" students. You will feel more demoralized by doing that. You are the only one who decides what is best for you. If getting all B is good for you, aim for that. Everyone have different goals. There will be always people better than you so the least you could do is give it your best.. Everyone can be both an underachiever and overachiever, all that differs is perspective and who you compare yourself against.

Even in schools like hwachong, programs like GEP, the divide can be huge. There will be both people barely scraping by, and people who are veritable geniuses. No matter how high you go, you can always feel like an underachiever if you compare yourself to the ""right"" group of people.

Chill out a little. Many things dont matter as much as you may think it does in the long run.. Like other commenters said, there is always a bigger mountain. Moreover, O levels as a standardized test allows you to pit yourself against students from other schools on even grounds, regardless of whether they are from a top school. Just focus and do your best in O's. 

This kind of comparison follows all through your life. I went to a top 10 university, but felt like an absolute dunce inside with many actual geniuses inside. Just focused on working hard and getting my degree, and secured a nice job. Then in my job, you see your teammates hitting their career goals with ease while you ask yourself what the actual fuck youre doing. 

Basically, focus and work hard!. I imagine it's human nature to do so. The syndrome you're describing is called imposter syndrome.. Your grades certainly don't define you. But they go a long way to helping you get options that will serve to define you. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying; the absolute truth is that they're at best, indicators of aptitude and attitude although they aren't able to differentiate the mix in between. 

For instance, a super smart but lazy kid may score the same as a kid who studied super hard but has average intelligence. Their score outcomes may be identical and for what it's worth, in the working world, it's also likely that they'll have the same professional outcomes. 

That said, just because you're horrible at one thing doesn't mean you're horrid at all things. LKY famously said himself that if he had elected to be an artist, he would've found life very difficult which isn't a slight on the arts so much as a reference to the fact that everyone has their own gifts and yours may not be so easily assessed by numbers on a page. 

And again, that said - I would still encourage you to do the best you can because education also has a bit of a multiplier effect and good grades fundamentally buys you more options. Just because you can get into Harvard doesn't mean you have to go. But not having the grades to get in means even if you would excel there, you may not be able to do so. 

Stay strong and keep your head up!. Because you compare. Don't compare.. 'compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to someone else today' - jordan peterson. As a mid career professional in his 40s, here's some (hopefully) useful advice for you:

1. Once you come out to work, nobody's going to give a shit about your grades.
2. Just so it's clear, nobody gives a shit about your grades once you're working.
3. Also to clarify, this doesn't mean you shouldn't give a fuck about your studies. The education system is meant to teach how to approach, analyse and tackle problems systematically, and also perhaps you get to pick up soft skills (hopefully) along the way.
4. Treasure your friends and people you meet in school and while you're young, you never know when any one of them will be of great help to you in the future in your career. 
5. Finally, good luck for your Os, but just remember not to let your grades define you.. you‚Äôre still young, there‚Äôs still pasture for you out there to at least achieve mediocrely or more. Paper isn't everything when you start working next time, unless you are in civil service or government jobs.. ""The first step to solve any problem is to realize there is one."" - Someone

Good job in realizing it at such a young age. It's good to know that as it keeps you eating that humble pie. Ëá™Ê±Ç‰∏äËøõ is always good, end day just make sure whatever you are doing makes you happy.. in a few years' time no one cares which sec sch you came from or how you did for your O lvls. Why do u feel the need to compare? If u want to compare, why not with those who did poorer than u?

Be glad you did well, focus on urself and ur own life and not on others. I just focus on myself and just dont give a fuck about others. Take it day by day. Accept not all of us are special.. Rather be the king of beggars than the beggar of kings.. This is how the system is built. The higher the scores you get, the greater achiever you are. Achievements should not be scored. The scores that you get while studying does not matter later in your life.. Dont let your current perspective undermine your achievements. Good results? Stay consistent and see if you can make something out of it. My results were always the bottom line till I joined the working force. Slog my ass off and worked hard everyday. 

Now, passed 1 decade of time. No one looks at academic results, nor speak about yr PSLE results. Its all about appearance. You can be decked out in luxury goods yet drive a toyota Vios, versus someone who wears Uniqlo everyday but drives a Lamborghini. By then you will realize, the perspective has shifted.   


Just do your best in life and try to achieve goals. Singapore's elitism culture has an effect on all of us. Its inevitable. Only way? Live your life and fight your own path. 

Like everyone else mentioned, you can be the top student in yr school and yet, when you join future JC/Poly, there are people still better. Its never ending. Find yr own path. Feeling underachiever is just a ""side quest"". Main objective is to be yourself, do yourself great.. Exams are around the corner, control your expectations, don't self-paralyze. Know what can be control, what cannot be control, continue to have the spirit to push.

I've seen enough 4th/5th class beat 1st class in terms of results, because of wrongly applied pressure and poor management of expectations which crippled the mental side of the student.

Having positive mindset is very important.. You just have to accept it, different ppl have different talents. Was in the same boat (neighbourhood sec to ""elite"" jc) and the divide was very apparent, as my sec sch friends worked just as if not harder than my jc friends, but just didn't perform as well. The intellectual gap is not easily addressed because some ppl think it's sensitive and also not much we can do about it, so why not accept it?. Intellectual divide is probably smaller than you think. What differs is the effort put in. Got to realise that top schools are incredibly competitive, where your peers will push you to do better than what you think you could do. For O-Levels it is not a IQ Test, if you work hard and study smart, you could get 6 'A's, easy.

As for how, internet is your friend. YouTube tutorials on courses, study tips, can probably help you go beyond your ciriculumn. Your greatest enemy is probably how much time you waste - time yourself to see how much time you waste per day.. You feel like an underachiever? Well great, recognise that it's just a feeling and go back to focus on your own O Levels and less nonsensical distractions like that.. Lolz careful dude you are posting in a sub of elite JC / IP / IB types. *You might be a big fish*  
*In a little pond*  
*Doesn't mean you've won*  
*'Cause a long may come*  
*A bigger one*  
\-  [Coldplay - Lost!]( Its mainly down to your school's teachers and yourself. Putting people who have real problem studying aside, for a normal human being with average intelligence, getting good grades is dependent on how your school prepares you and the effort you want to put in. It is unfair but some school's teachers are just that much better at preparing a student for O lvl.. Don‚Äôt feel bad about yourself. 

In an ageing world, your youth is a big asset. You‚Äôll be surprised how many OECD countries are looking for young people to emigrate there. 

Bide your time until you‚Äôre old enough then contact an emigration agency for a free consult to see what your options are.. Username checks out. Totally agreed man. To not feel like an underachiever, you can't just get better grades, you have to adjust your perception.

No matter how good your grades are, you can still feel like an underachiever. Even if your O lvls good you go RI, RI students also got those that go oxford and those that go NTU, and even those that go oxford got pp go Goldman Sachs got people go OCBC. Then even if u go Goldman knn you realise you have to work for your clients born with a lot of money or made it big in business. If you don't change your mentality, it's a constant vicious cycle that cannot be satisfied by any external achievement.. Human Compare Human, Angry Die Human. 

Happy can already.. Or be a shark in a big pond. Challenge the norm, who say neighbourhood schools can't fight the other sharks. I want to be a zebra. I will like to be babyshark. those are cold blooded peasants!. That‚Äôs awful; sorry you had to go through that. And also upsetting that SG society has put these expectations on your parent‚Äôs shoulders. Who doesn‚Äôt want to see their children succeed? But there‚Äôs a point when it‚Äôs too much, and that point is when you‚Äôre tearing your family apart because of this.

There are Hwa Chong kids who flunk out of uni. There are also ITE kids who get government scholarships. Let‚Äôs not delude ourselves that this is the norm, and I don‚Äôt think this is the most encouraging thing to say. What‚Äôs more important is that we all try our best and be ambitious regardless of what we put our minds to. We can all succeed in various ways.. University is where most of my poly friends (the ones with high enough GPA and a wallet deep enough for the fees) realize that... just pass can liao no need aim for As.. Lol what you mean?. How is jc elite?. ;(. anime plot twist of the century. Rather be an algal boom in the ocean.. It‚Äôs not that everyone in a neighborhood school cannot challenge anyone in an elite school. Virtually every neighborhood school has a few students that get results that are on a par with elite school ones - 6 As or more etc. The issue is these students are the minority in neighborhood schools and the majority in elite schools. That‚Äôs something every neighborhood school has tried to challenge and failed to do since forever.. Elite from the womb listen to baby mozart liao. The water they drink is ginseng water. Their conti car so expensive till drive no need signal, because whoever buang them straight away bankurpt. They go for short weekend trip is go europe, maldives. They know all the who's who, parents always appear in singapore tattler. tuition teachers all elite and polite, grooming them to be the top of the world, not top of the class. Their school do IB, so cheem and atas till 95% of the population can't say it. They are well rested, happy, and confident. Everything they do is with their own 2 hands and ability. Undisputed winners in society.

Neighbourhood school in the womb listen to parent kpkb no money. Water drink from the tap. Take BMW (Bus MRT Walk), so low class till hit and run them also no penalty. Their short weekend trip is go Jurong East or Yishun. Parents know Tan Ah Kow who give 2 cents more when selling karang guni. School got N-Level students, so low class that the elites don't even know it exist. Got time go group tuition with other neighbourhood kids, after school go pak LAN, gai gai till late at night. They are stressed, unhappy and insecure. Everything they do also no point, because other people sure better than them. Undisputed losers in society.

How to fight like that?. Go shop pee pee pee pee pee. People who just read through notes before a common test and score almost full marks. People who get internships that pay them $10k a month. People who are already running businesses and making a livable salary. If you're just an average person these feats will seem incredible..

It‚Äôs just funny that as his final push he starts bragging about his perceived net worth, as though he expects her to prostrate at his feet at the revelation.

I like science and am pretty good at it, but it seems that ITE central does not have any science related courses. Having said that, what course should I pick then? Preferably one that will help me when I get to poly and take science there (hopefully). Any advice for me regarding ITE central will also be appreciated.",0,0.36,7.0,"Hi, if I‚Äôm not wrong only ITE East offers Science related courses under DPP. Do take note, being good at the subjects doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôll do well in the Science course. I would say choose the course out of passion or interest. This is because you would not want to lose interest halfway and then everything else just goes down. Look at the course booklet or online to find out about other courses that ITE offers under DPP. Do note that if you take a non-Science related course in DPP, you‚Äôre not allowed to choose a Science course in poly due to the restriction. (This was for my case, but it‚Äôs good to clarify with a ECG teacher) You may try your luck via EAE, but it‚Äôs a gamble as it‚Äôs not guaranteed you‚Äôll be offered the course. And also, you may get better luck at r/sgexams. Go to science course that you want in Poly. Look up their admission requirement for ITE applicants, which will have a list relevant courses. Weigh each courses and see which one fits the bill the most. Apply for it and study hard.. I do indeed have interest/passion for science, and it's honestly the only thing I'm good at. Also I'm not really considering going to ITE east, as it is quite far from my home, plus I live very near ITE central. Also, how do I know if a course in ITE is science related? I haven't really read up on any of them, only judged them by their names.. Do take this time to review the courses available. For each course that‚Äôs under DPP, there will be a PDF document posted online that shows which courses you can apply for in poly. They‚Äôre known as Mapped (directly related to the course you chose) or Relevant (not directly related but some elements are similar to the course you chose/allowed by Poly). As long as the course you want in poly falls either in the Mapped or Relevant table, you‚Äôre good to choose that course in ITE. 

For example: [Higher Nitec in Chemical Technology (DPP)]( I see, thank you. Seeing as ITE east indeed has a science course, I am considering it, but it is unfortunately about 17 km from where I live. Is it worth it in your opinion? Or simply just too far?. Honestly, if you‚Äôre really passionate for it I would say go for it. Otherwise, perhaps you can find a course as close to your interest as possible that will still allow you to apply for a Science course of your choice in poly. I can understand how you feel, as distance/convenience is very important to me and in fact, is one of my top priorities when choosing a course and the school. So it‚Äôs good to think about all these. Perhaps you can ask yourself, do you foresee seeing yourself in the Science industry? If you are truly passionate, then distance doesn‚Äôt matter because you‚Äôll enjoy the things that you‚Äôll be exposed to in your course.. Honestly, when I think of what I want to do as work, the only thing that comes to mind is science. I enjoy doing science so much, which is mostly why I am good at it in the first place. I've literally never gotten anything below an 'A' grade for science since p3 (was it p3? I forgot) when it was first introduced, hehe. Anyway, thank you very much for your advice, and I will definitely take more time to consider carefully. :)",591.0,3,73,1
31,"Government scholars of Reddit, what is your experience like?",dl1grg,2019-10-21 14:37:45,"PSC or SAF scholars here on Reddit, what was your experience like as a scholar in the government service? Care to share your experience whether in application, university, or even working life (thoughts on CEP, salary, opportunities, rotations etc)? And how has it been like compared to your peers who may not be scholars, or choose to pursue opportunities outside the public sector? Can use a throwaway for obvious reasons!",45,0.84,38.0,"Hearsay one

CEP determines where and how fast you will progress, but it is not cast in stone. New education etc will help

Scholar comes in to your department, there is a good chance they will take away the A rating. I mean they are good in the first place also.

Bell curve game again, your performance is always relative to the others.

Then rotate to other department, same cycle repeats.

But if you are a farmer, see those scholars come in, you can switch your year end holiday destination to bali instead of paris in advance already.

Most likely get C rating one. all my PSC friends hate SAFOS scholars because they‚Äôre stupid, sexist, and can‚Äôt seem to think outside of army concepts (everything is reduced to some unit‚Äôs core values like swift ready decisive - it‚Äôs beyond self parody). Ez pz earn lots of money.

Parachute anywhere, arrows everywhere

Then break bond

(Source: one friend). PSC usually will be DD or director by end of bond if you toe the line.

You will likely make more than the vast majority of peers, including doctors and lawyers, with good work life balance, if you are satisfied with getting 200-300k a year in your early to mid 30s. Personally, I know a Navy SAFOS who studied in the UK. Went around telling his friends(us) his life is set, going to take it easy since promotion is almost guaranteed after each rotation. 

Family members also went around bragging how life is going to be 'easy' for him. No matter what he does, he's gonna get promoted

Seriously meh the caliber of scholars these days. I really wonder how 'rigourous' is the selection process. People seem to apply for scholarships only the pretext of genuine interest in public service.. On a inverse note are there any stories of non-scholars who are super capable and ended up rising thru the ranks quickly (ie they didmt choose to move to the private sector)?. Cannot use throwaway here unfortunately. Karma bot will strike poster down.. If you are interested to learn more, drop me a PM. Cheers!. >Scholar comes in to your department, there is a good chance they will take away the A rating. I mean they are good in the first place also.

Nope. I have a family member who's a PSC OMS scholar. He gets B rating because he's an average performer among his scholar colleagues (you're rated against other scholars and not farmers). But the rotation part is true. They parachuted him around and gave him a lot of work, so his pay grade also rose very quickly.. Meritocracy in action!. i always wondered if those people realise that their unit mottos always double as a fart joke. [deleted]. Thats alot. >if you are satisfied with getting 200-300k a year in your early to mid 30s

That's if you make it to admin service.. PSC seem to earn a lot but work like dogs... I wouldn't recommend.. Given that a Court of Appeal judge makes $253,200 base salary a year, this is not too bad!. If he toes the line and does not screw up, his career will be still be better than a hard working farmer, even with minimal effort put in.. Generally people don't move from civil service to private sector. Usually it's the other way round.. > On a inverse note are there any stories of non-scholars who are super capable and ended up rising thru the ranks quickly (ie they didmt choose to move to the private sector)?

there is this thing call the high po. farmers who are capable and CEP is likely 8/7. if you don't screw up and keep getting Bs and above, even the year after your promotion, likley they ID you as high po.. > paygrade also rose very quickly

The only thing that matters. Thanks for clarifying the misconception. 5SIR - Silent, deadly, swift. Speed thru skills?. 3SIR - Silent and effective. He means scholars get to literally jump into senior/managerial roles without having to go through the grunt work first like a common promotion from bottom up. A lot to some but not to others. You also need a stomach for the public service. My bad I assumed OP was discussing the equivalent of the old PSC OMS/SAFOS since they are a league of their own vs the other lower tier scholarships. I believe you are admin service by default there. Depends on which ministry you end up with and your boss I guess

A director I know is quite happy and leaves on the dot as far as possible so he can lead by example. Being a judge has other perks though, like the fact that it's a tenured position. The only people who can remove you from your position is yourself (by resigning) and the President under the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Not to mention the amount of power and respect you garner.. I mean it's good enough for the vast majority of people to farm until they retire, especially if your spouse makes a similar amount, unless you have huge appetites for material goods. May I ask why is this so?. And it's very obvious who the airborne people are, because they can be such gross misfits in departments outside of their training/educational background. From my limited point of view (one ministry and one stat board), it does seem like those scholars who perform well and/or hit their KPIs are the ones blessed with the support of good advisors. Good advisors in the form of seasoned junior/middle managers who worked their way up the ""farmer route"" slowly, gaining actual useful experience along the way.. I don't know about the olden days. Perhaps last time they were admin service by default because admin service wasn't overpopulated like now. The non admin service OMS in my family makes about 150k p.a. all in and he's in his early 30s. While it's a lot, it's definitely not as much as people think. He once told me that he regretted getting the scholarship because some of his peers in private sector are making over 200k and doing more interesting work.. It's almost always a pay cut and a demotion when you move from civil service to the private sector unless you come from places like MAS or EDB, where your insider knowledge is valued. The pay cut is because promotions are automatic up till a certain point in civil service, which means you're likely in a higher position than where you'd be in the private sector, and the employers in the private sector knows that.. Thanks for the data point. Is that the pay for assistant director position or DD.

150k in early 30s is probably on par with other stat board scholarships like DSTA so it's not too bad.

I know people who reached dd/director level by end of bond getting 200-300k so I guess they may be higher performers rather than the norm. He started as AD in MTI which is standard for OMS holders and now he's DD.. Wow that's surprising low for DD at MTI.

I have friends in stat boards early-mid 30s below DD level getting 200k. Gotta note that ministries have inflated titles. A DD in a ministry is likely just an AD in a statboard.",1203.0,9,70,1
32,Orchard Road shophouse picks up restoration award; URA marks 30 years of conservation,dl1eyg,2019-10-21 14:33:49,notexthere,10,0.92,1.0,"> # Orchard Road shophouse picks up restoration award; URA marks 30 years of conservation

> SINGAPORE - The sensitive restoration of a century-old shophouse, near MacDonald House in Orchard Road, picked up one of the island's most prestigious conservation awards at the annual Architectural Heritage Awards on Monday (Oct 21).

> Called Temasek Shophouse, the building which used to be a townhouse with apartments and shops, was the sole winner of the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) award for restoration.

> The URA, which has been administering the award since 1995, said the building's original ornamentation and missing features were carefully restored, returning it as close to its original form as possible.

> For instance, false ceilings at its five-footway were removed, drawing attention to its original double height columns.

> Inside, a two-storey atrium now stands in the place of bulky escalators from the 1980s, introducing a new sense of spaciousness to the building, it said.

> The 18-month restoration of the state property had been undertaken by lessee Temasek Trustees and architect Surbana Jurong Consultants.

> The site is home to Temasek‚Äôs philanthropy arm and has space for its co-working partners, as well as a public arena on the ground level.

> The award was announced by Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development, at an event which also marked the URA's 30-year conservation journey.

> He spent much of his speech emphasising the importance of community partnerships and support in making the cityscape more diverse.

> Related Story URA to conserve former Singapore Chinese Girls' School buildings in Emerald Hill

> Related Story Public encouraged to inject new ideas into old buildings under URA, SLA reinvention scheme

> On the award, Ms Yvonne Tay, director of Temasek Shophouse, said: ""To take over an old conserved building and re-imagine it as something that can make an impact on Singapore's future, is something we are happy to be doing.""

> In his speech, Mr Lee noted that the authorities have taken a more inclusive and consultative approach to co-create and sustain Singapore's built heritage landscape.

> For example, he highlighted the efforts of a group of Singapore Chinese Girls' School alumnae who conducted community workshops to put together a proposal to conserve their former campus at 37 Emerald Hill Road.

> URA, which had already been studying the overall plans for the Orchard Road area, carefully considered the group's proposal as part of its review, he said.

> The site's three oldest buildings are now conserved.

> Mr Lee said Singapore's conservation journey can be traced back to as early as the 1960s when pioneer planners saw the importance of selectively and pragmatically protecting the island's built heritage.

> He paid tribute to individuals such as Mr Alan Choe, the first general manager of the Urban Renewal Unit in the 1960s; Mrs Koh-Lim Wen Gin, who as a young architect led an urban design team in the 1970s to conserve low-rise historic districts in the city centre and made conservation a priority; and Mr Khoo Teng Chye, who later took up the role of chief executive and chief planner of URA.

> Mr Lee added that then-Minister for National Development, Mr S. Dhanabalan, who was present at the event, had provided critical political support to make urban conservation a reality in 1989 when URA formalised its conservation programme and conserved more than 3,200 buildings in the districts of Chinatown, Little India, Kampong Glam, Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, Cairnhill and Emerald Hill.

> Mrs Koh-Lim, who also addressed event attendees at the URA's building in Maxwell Road, noted the challenges ahead of Singapore's conservation journey, such as the question of the future of Singapore's now rundown post-independent, modern architectural landmarks.

> She urged for their retention and for them to be ""reused and recycled"" in the name of sustainability as they serve as markers of Singapore's progress. This was met with applause.

> These buildings include Golden Mile Complex and People's Park Complex.

> Mr Lee also recognised the efforts of URA's conservation partners such as public agency, the Singapore Tourism Board, and organisations such as the Singapore Heritage Society.

> He said: ""We have taken a more inclusive and consultative approach to co-create and sustain our built heritage landscape.

> ""We will continue to engage and collaborate deeply with the industry, community, and all Singaporeans to protect, sustain and enliven our built heritage for the next 30 years, and many more generations to come.""

33,Parents who allow their toddlers or child assess to iPad - how do you think it has affected their development?,dl1drq,2019-10-21 14:31:27,"It‚Äôs common sight in Singapore nowadays to see children glued to iPad. I have seen that on strollers, dining table, playgrounds, cinemas etc.

There have been many reports that advised against children with assess to iPads. And I have some colleagues who swears that their kids should never be given iPad till a certain age, as it affects them negatively.

I‚Äôm very curious to those who have done so - especially allowing assess as young as when they were toddlers. Has this affected their development, study or affection towards family?

Thanks for sharing",14,0.8,34.0,"I think the most robust conclusions we can make about the effects of electronic devices' overuse lies not in what it *causes*, but what it denies the child of doing. A child who is glued in front of a device for long hours is denied the opportunities of doing what typical children tend to be able to do (e.g., interacting with people).

A child with dozens of games at his/her fingertips would not learn how to share their toys. A child who can be entertained by YouTube videos would not need a parental figure to read to him/her. A phone/tablet that does not require verbal responses denies a child the chance to practice speaking. He/she wouldn't have a chance to practice decoding body language, interpret emotions, and probably be denied a variety of other communication skills.. A friend's kid, around 3yrs barely able to speak waved me goodbye and added ""pweese subswibe if you like."". Had a short stint at KK Hospital, so there were some stuff that i observed about the kids. 

Background: we need kids to stay still for their scans or the images are blurred and we need to redo. But the longer the kid stays there, the longer they will cry/move, so we always want to get the scan done fast and in one sitting. We always explain to the parents first so that they can help us handle their own kids, so there are typically two types of parents: the ones who gave them toys to play/they talk to the kids and explain in simpler terms what is going on; and the ones who just ""lie down there, dont move."" and chuck a phone to them with different youtube videos.

The kids from the former category are more responsive when i (a ""stranger"") talk to them and play with them to entertain + calm them down before the scan. The kids from the latter category generally either cry or ignored me when i do the same thing. 

I also noticed that the parents of the former category will tell their kids to ""say thank you to jiejie"" and made sure they do it, whereas the parents of the latter category either (1) they themselves dont say thank you/or they say thank you but wont ask their kids to do so, or (2) the kids hold the phone/ipad and walk out of the room, ignoring their parents who asked them to say thank you.

This is just an observation, and i dont have my own kids or anything. Though this observation is sufficient for me to decide to not let my kids have easy access to screens (until 5-7yo, but it'll be a restricted time section too), and to teach them proper manners.. assess. Steve Jobs did not allow his children access to iPads or iPhones. My opinion is using such devices at a young age is detrimental to development such as socialising,. Not a parent, but the way i understand is that the television used to shut up the kids and keep em quiet for loads of time

Same with the ipad. The thing can shut up the kids

It‚Äôs like a mini-daycare in the palm of your hand

So yeah, tv is bad for you. Ipad is bad for you. But yeah... lazy parents...

So these kids kinda grow up with stunted social skills / EQ. Have difficulty with non-verbal communication / cues. 

They can get brainwashed into thinking life/reality is based on what they see on screen

Like for example, how women think disney movies accurately represent ideals in a relationship... and how frustrated women can get once they become disillusioned and learn that real relationships take plenty of hard work communicating sacrificing and personal / character / peofessional growth

And how pornography does not accurately represent sex. Men become frustrated when they start realizing sex is not what is they see in porn. Seen plenty of parents giving phones/ipads to their kids to get them to quiet down just so they can play games on another phone instead. I pity the kids for having such shit parents.. When everytime I eat out, I see entire families staring at their phones at the table, there‚Äôs really no hope for the kids.. It is not advisable to give children access to all these screen time before the age of 5. even at the age of 5, and it's better to give them screen time in a strict schedule or based on rewards (eg. you can play some game ONLY if you finish your work) otherwise the child will grow up thinking whatever/whenever they want it, it's always given to them.   


We are a generation in between lacking high technology to all the technology advance within these 10-20 years hence we know how to appreciate everything now more.. Hi all, real parent here.

When I was young, they said TV was bad. Now they say iPad is bad. It's the same old cliche to fear new tech.

As with anything in life you have to consume in moderatation. A good thing can be bad if you give too much.

iPad is good for learning and development, especially with digital media. Being comfortable with technology is a core skill now. You will be left behind if you cannot navigate the digital landscape. By that I don't mean just tap tapping away, but learning to understand the virtual environment, it's a skill that's barely understood.

Some kids 'get' the environment, some kids don't. It's like Neo in the Matrix, they can 'see' past the game. They are plugged in. 

I realised my kids had too much when they couldn't focus, when they were presented with too much choice they did not finish whatever they were watching and chose something else. You got to curate what they consume.

I also limited greatly their digital time, max 1 hour a day, with more on weekends.

I also looked for apps that encourages play through learning, virtual toys so to speak. Nothing too formal like math or spelling, those will be covered in preschool.

iPads are great if you just simply can't stand their constant jabbering and misbehaving and want some peace and quiet too. 

Imagine you're in a nice restaurant and your kids are out of control and you've run out of ideas or are too tired, the iPad comes out as last resort.

So Redditors without children, please don't judge what you see in public. Things are never so simple.. I‚Äôm not a parent but I‚Äôm a tutor who teaches primary school students. Many people think that gadgets & screen time are bad because it affects children academically, but personally I think the effect it has on their executive functioning (attention, awareness of the surrounding, self regulation etc) is worse. The most extreme case I‚Äôve seen so far is a 10 year old boy who plays with his iPad/parent‚Äôs phone so much that other than his very poor studies (failing at almost all subjects), he lacks life skills like telling the time, knowing which switch turns on the fan/light in the room (I know this better than him and I only see him twice a week) and showing disinterest in his surroundings. What is also frightening is how his eyes seem dead & he‚Äôs like an empty shell. He doesn‚Äôt know what he likes and his favourite activity during a holiday trip was to ‚Äústay in the hotel room and do nothing‚Äù. 

Am I saying gadgets, YouTube & screen time are bad? No. With regulation & supervision from parents, these tech stuff can enhance a child‚Äôs learning & exposure to the world. I‚Äôve seen how some students are more aware of the world because they watch various educational videos on YouTube, and parents discuss about such videos with them. What‚Äôs not good is when parents do not limit screen time limit and/or they‚Äôre lax about it. That is when the child spend precious time of his childhood passively watching the screen without practising on vital life skills like communication, empathy, awareness etc. I implore all parents to think about this if you have not. At the risk of being dramatic, the next generation does depend on how the parents now bring up their children.. i only do this during dinner time out, the point of it all is to engaged with what they are watching and feed them not just letting them watch and do your own stuff. my kid learnt so much from cocomelon songs.. My 2 year old watches about 30-60 minutes of Netflix every couple days and maybe more ok weekends. Usually Peppa Pig or Ben and Holly. She randomly tells me stuff like ""I'm cold so i have to put on gloves just like the peppa pig"" so I guess she learns something from it.

My 5 year old spends maybe 30-40 minutes a day on average playing games. Recently he's been really into San Juan and I think it's been pretty good at making him think. TBH it's quite tiring for me to play it with him so I'm glad we live in a age where I can offload it to an AI. At the same time he gets more development in terms of brain activity per unit time and I just pop in from time to time to give him pointers.

So far so good no complaints. Some days they get more especially if we are meeting friends etc but I can see how extended hours on a regular basis may cause behavioral issues.. It's pretty observable already, babies sometimes just sit within the stroller staring at screens at coffee shops or markets. The noticeable behaviour is ""they talk literally to the device itself"".

The small device capture their attention span the whole day, is technically their ""best friend"", though communicative-ly its 1 way. Cries for it every time it gets taken away.

Child still respond actively to direct close family, but selectively ignore new people. I think most of us possibly see it as addiction like drug but it may be a situation that calls for the adult to find new ways, device related, to break into the hive.

Another way of sharing time together through device. It almost similar to group of friend connected through device games, social app, video share can be quite legitimate. They still respond to people within the device.

In some ways, this is directly related to consumer culture impacting our mode of living.. My ex colleague let his daughter use iPad since very young age, very very young age. I don‚Äôt know how that affects her development, study or affection to family. I only know she needs spectacles since very very young age, 3 or 4yo I think. Both the parents are not wearing specs.. I'd like to believe it's not the medium, but rather the content. If proper curation is done, such devices are a great tool for learning. YouTube possesses a wealth of knowledge that kids can benefit from (check out Ted-Ed). There are also many apps that can help reinforce mathematical concepts in a fun way, to the extent the child doesn't even realise that it's math!

That said, parental involvement in the entire process is key. You can't just chuck the device to the child. Watch the video or play the game with them, then have conversations about the experience. Definitely helps with the bonding, and on the plus side your kid will think you're cool!. Did he also say, hai, I‚Äôm Imm-ran when you first met him?. That‚Äôs pretty worrying.. This is good to know. Thanks for sharing!. >Steve Jobs did not allow his children access to iPads or iPhones

He didn't allow them access to their father either.. Steve Jobs also died from a totally curable form of cancer because he used bullshit ""natural"" remedies.. I disagree. 

For me, its about setting limits on how often they can use it, and when they do use it, they gotta use the devices for ‚Äúproper‚Äù purposes. 

For e.g. for us: 
- we put limits to how long they can use it for (max 45 mins... after that go get your colouring books or something), no devices at the dining table (I absolutely can‚Äôt stand it when I see parents feeding their 4 year old kids, while he / she is glued to YouTube). If it‚Äôs a family gathering, it‚Äôs a nope. Go play with your cousins. 
- now as for why they can use it for, its mostly ‚Äúeducational‚Äù apps and games. Some of them are pretty good, some of them are trash; I usually preview them before allowing it, and play it with them to explain / help them learn (spelling, math, puzzles) 
- They are not allowed to watch those trashy toy unboxing YouTube channels because those really turn their brains into mush (it‚Äôs fucking scary looking at how they enter a state of hypnosis). If they want to watch something it‚Äôd be a ‚Äúproper‚Äù cartoon or an animal documentary on Netflix

End of the day, the devices are tools, they have benefits (exposure, language development, creativity, psychomotor skills) and they have dysfunctional uses (there‚Äôs A LOT of trash out there). 

From observation:
- a lot of parents just chuck them to their kids and don‚Äôt monitor it, esp for older kids who learn how to click to trashy videos... it‚Äôs really alarming seeing some of the stuff they are watching. 
- They also don‚Äôt get involved enough to ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù them to more advanced things as they develop. For e.g. If your kids above 1 or 2 are still watching those Chu Chu tv nursery rhyme songs on YouTube (60 mins of wheels on the bus), the only thing they are going to be able to say or sing is wheels on the bus.. i always feel that the device is like a swiss army knife of education for kids and the parents are the teacher.. the main problem is the parents didnt interact with what they are watching.. I disagree with ‚Äúbefore the age of 5‚Äù... there are good educational types of apps / videos for ages below that; I‚Äôve seen good progress with my own kids. 

That being said, I agree that the key is that it has to be scheduled / time restricted / rewarded, but I would add that parents need to use the devices WITH them (and cultivate their interests etc) and not just hand it over and let them do what they want (I.e. trashy YouTube videos). Hi, I understand your point especially regarding the restaurant behavior. But have you tried other things like activity or coloring books? I usually use these so my kids can stay still in a restaurant. I know may not work for all kids, just sharing what worked for me.. Be that as it may, I still agree with Steve Jobs decision to cut off access to all electronic devices from his kids.

As someone who have toddler siblings, it really does more harm than good. Already my sister bawls like mad when the tablet‚Äôs taken away from her and she sleeps with it every night. 

That and she usually watch those Russian kids videos where the kids are really, really... bossy and my sister eats all of that up. Parents discipline attempts don‚Äôt work at all and my father‚Äôs Drill Sergeant Nasty.

Now she‚Äôs restricted to nursery rhyme videos only but just like drug rehab, it‚Äôs a thorny path.

Only good thing that I can think of is her subconsciously knowing a lick of Russian.. genuine question: can‚Äôt you download a colouring book app on ur ipad, does that present them with the same positive effect as a physical colouring book or is that still detrimental to their development. when those fail, the phone is my final weapon.. You would agree that it‚Äôs an issue of discipline and needing to teach her what is good and what is not good content though right? 

IMO, its less to do with the devices themselves. 

And I REALLY know what you mean by those creepy Russian videos, they are super fucked up and toddlers (even my own) get **addicted** to that shit. (And the stupid surprise egg unboxing videos... the worst trash ever.) 

The nursery rhymes are less bad, but as I said in another comment here, if that‚Äôs the only thing your kids are watching, that‚Äôs the only thing they‚Äôre going to be learning (any kid above 1.5 should not be watching little BABY bum imo).

But this is something that needs to be actively worked on, you can‚Äôt expect kids to do the right thing because young kids are basically animals that only follow their immediate instincts. I myself as a parent made these mistake on my part because I did not fully understand the amount of trash that kids could get exposed to. But when I did see it happening, I immediately had to intervene in very heavy handed way. 

For e.g. It took me a long time to establish to my kids that those sorts of videos are bad for them. I had to drill into my older girl that those videos will ‚Äúturn her brain to slime. I don‚Äôt want you watching them because I‚Äôd rather you do things that are good for you (like animal documentaries or sesame street for e.g.)‚Äù. 

For nursery rhyme videos, I keep telling them that ‚Äúthese are for babies - are you a baby? Do you want to go back sleeping in a cot and be wrapped up in a swaddle?‚Äù Etc 

And I had to punish her (‚Äúplatoon sergeant dad mode ON‚Äù) for sneakily attempting to watch them (by taking my mom‚Äôs phone) on a few occasions. 

It took a while to undo the damage, but she doesn‚Äôt think of them today, thankfully. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say is that we have such technology in our hands, but we often just leave it to the kids to decide what they can and cannot do by chucking it on  them, and not using the devices WITH them. Or at least switching on kids mode (Samsung tablets have this), or something that sets boundaries. 

It‚Äôs easy to just blame the technology itself and ban it around the house, but that‚Äôs at the expense of all the other good things that it can bring.. Your Mum: ok time for bed

Your sister: **CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMAKE SUKA BLYAT**. yes I don't see what's wrong with that as the app involves interaction, creativity and motor skills. they don't become Zombies. I‚Äôll agree with the fact that ultimately, my parents are at fault (and I‚Äôm partly to blame too being her elder brother) for enabling it in the first place.

Agree. It‚Äôs one thing to let kids watch videos on YouTube. It‚Äôs a different ball game entirely when we leave them to their own devices, outright replacing the tutoring and consoling aspects of parenting with technology.

35,Advice wanted: My estate's rooftop carpark is a teenage love hotel,dl0poq,2019-10-21 13:40:56,"Hi r/Singapore, I've noticed something really troubling happening in my estate recently. So a bit of pretext, my flat is located next to a multi-storey carpark that has a roof garden, which is great for me, because I get unblocked views from my house. However, recently I've been told by my sister that she noticed teens (usually a boy and a girl) coming up to the roof of the carpark during the wee hours of the night, and they were PDA-ing as told by my sis. Anyways, I personally didn't see anything happening there so I didn't think much about it. Well, until today. So today at dusk I saw a teen couple being intimate with each other on the roof. Ew. I don't know if the teens don't know or don't care if people from the flats nearby can see them, but I definitely don't want to see them. 

So r/singapore, any advice on how to deal with this situation?

Print out a photo of Josephine Teo doing the thumbs up and paste it at where they like to fuck.. Just put the name of the carpark out in edmw.

May i get the condo name?
Strictly for reporting purpose... Live and let live la, I stay highest floor in the corner unit, near staircase. I have seen my share of good show! Our birth rate so low already, you are gonna cause a few less babby with your complain, probably.

Even once, someone manage to steal the gachapon machine from the minimart downstairs and moved it upstairs to break it open.. 1000w led light and a megaphone. Take photo and stomp lor lol. Buy a loud hailer and start giving them instructions on how to PDA. Confirm won't be seeing them anytime soon.. just leave them be. Report to town council and tell them to lock the access door to the roof garden lor. But seriously anyone who happens to be the relevant authority for this....might have the same level of fucks given as the other redditors' comments lol (unless you get more neighbours to mass report, that might expedite things). Got free show go watch la. Wa lao eh. Let them be, they're doing something radical cos they're not doing it In Small Spaces.

That or you could open the window and applaud, I know someone who did that once.. imo Singapore is a really small country with little private spaces. kudos to them for finding a obscure rooftop garden rather than full out ‚Äòbeing intimate‚Äô in the middle of orchard road or something. let teens be teens don‚Äôt restrict the already stringent culture. Take video post on sg nasilemak.. Advice: close your fucking blinds and mind your own business.

You don't want to see then don't see la. You stop them from doing anything at this carpark they will find another carpark to be intimate at.. Let me teach you a little secret, when you see them, go up to the carpark nearby them and just stand there, staring, do it ever so often that they are creeped out and deathly afraid of going there, this will cause them to reflect on their actions and realise they have wasted their lives, then they will hide from society in their small little house in a corner of their room, not eating or drinking for days on end, they will then rot and shrivel up into an infatuated meat twig, eliminating your problem once and for all.. get a loudhailer/loudspeaker. wait for them to get down to it and then go all ORH HOR on them..



this sounded better in my head.. Just ignore them la....it's not illegal or anything...I think...

If you really don't want them show PDA there, just get a speaker and play some romantic jazz music to play along with them. Either they will continue or leave.. Guess they trying to tell the estate people that they are keen for them to join. Or you can call it an Open Relationship.. If you can't stop yourself from watching them then I think you have bigger problems. This is a great idea. Can also add ‚ÄúAlways use protection, condoms can prevent unwanted pregnancies‚Äù. I might do this, considering it is anonymous and it saves the further embarrassment of being told by a person.. Laser.  Flash them like the honkies do on the police. Haha.. Or super strong torchlight to shine on them. In case they cannot see the one small red dot from the laser. But then he'll have to deal with prowling chi ko peks every time he look outside his window.

38,Maids in Singapore,dkzroc,2019-10-21 12:24:39,"Posting here after an observation for several days.

My grandma got hospitalised recently so for several days I've been accompanying for the entire time. So we saw a maid who was taking care of an ahma who got hospitalised too, but we noticed that she didn't eat for the entire time we were there (and it was for several days). My grandma then talked to her (in very broken english) and found out that she didnt eat yesterday at all. Throughout the day we smuggled some food for the maid to eat but she was so deathly afraid to accept it initially because the ahma will scold her.

Is this actually more common in Singapore than i initially thought it was? It feels like maid abuse at this stage. Any suggestions on how to help without worsening the situation for the maid as well?",203,0.99,74.0,"My friend‚Äôs maid only used to eat chicken feet when they cooked chicken at home. The never bothered to ask coz they thought she liked it.

One day my friend‚Äôs wife asked her and she said that her previous employer only fed her chicken feet....every....fking.....day.

Some people are so fking sadist.. It IS maid abuse and you could do the maid a favour by reporting the abuse.. Don't even need to look at kindness, manners, etiquette, kiasu mentality and whatnot. People who treat the domestic help this way (and probably don't even think twice about it) are the exact ""third world people"" that others talk about.. Talked to a helper, her boss only gave her white bread and water in the morning and instant noodles the rest of the day. Rice meal only one a week. What is wrong with people? :(. i have a colleague who complained that she has a maid who quit on her because my colleague doesnt allow her maid to use mobile phone during working hours. and boasting how good of employer she is by allowing her maid to use mobile phone at night and other chip in saying that their maids are not even allowed to use mobile phones at all. what kind of draconian rule is this and why cant we treat all people equally.... I saw a family once going for a buffet and their maid was with them. All of them were eating and enjoying themselves except for the maid. The maid was taking care of their kids and feeding them but the family didn't even bother to share anything with her.

I can't believe people like this still exist. What happened to humanity man. All the maids that my family hired in the past were always treated like family, we'll ask them to join us during meal times and if they felt like it they were free to cook whatever they wanted, we even bring the maids together on holidays and let them order whatever they want in restaurants. So seeing this kinda stuff was like a big shock to me.. You know what's crazy? People spend the extra $800-1000 to get domestic helpers, but refuse to spend any more to FEED them. That's disturbing AF.. Maids are the worst job ever in SG. They are at the lowest of the hierarchy and many Singaporeans are so entitled and demanding. I have seen Singapore maid owners vs Malaysia maid owners. Like heaven and hell. 

No magic fix on this issue as it all stems from upbringing and attitude. Since young Singaporeans already educated on hierarchy and rewards of being above others.. Do maid employment agencies even give domestic helpers a hotline to MOM and the police they can call in case of abuse? If they are not proficient in English maybe write smth in their native language that says ‚Äútell the police/MOM that there is a (insert number that serves as a code to signify abuse)‚Äù That should be a thing if it‚Äôs not.. people like this should be banned from hiring helpers and made to take care of their own shit let‚Äôs see how easy it is ya cunts. I bought my maid some sourdough breads because she love it but my friend questioned me why would I buy such expensive bread for her. 

‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt differentiate white bread and sourdough. No need to spend so much on her.‚Äù

I was speechless.. that's pretty odd, sounds like abusive treatment to me. My grandma has a maid as well, but she's treated like a family member. I really can't tolerate it when people treat maids as somehow 'lesser', I think you can report that, its illegal. A large majority of Singaporeans treat their domestic helpers like trash, property or children. Always shocked when I see how my friends and their parents treat their domestic helpers.

The domestic helpers employed by my parents when we young were lucky cos we treated each and every one of them like really part of family. Only thing I feel bad when I think back my mum did not allow the Muslim domestic helper we had, to pray. (My mum is a extreme Christian type). Many of them are also not aware of their rights. Got to remember that these are mostly young women from rural villages, they might see hardship as part of their job even though it isn't.. It's indeed abuse to not provide (sufficient) food for one's domestic worker. Previously for the maids looking after my grandmother at the hospital, my uncles and aunties will always provide them with money for food or Kopitiam card to use.

> so deathly afraid to accept it initially because the ahma will scold her

Could be her fear, could be miscommunication (language barrier).

My auntie's new maid was hungry and asked if she could eat the curry puff. My auntie said ok, eat one. She explained why she said eat one. Previously she asked the maid to eat, but the maid assumed she had to eat all 3 curry puffs, so took a long time to finish up and return.

> without worsening the situation for the maid as well?

This I'm not too sure. You might want to check with the NGO which are helping domestic workers.. The way many people here look down to maids is disgusting.  
My own family are also guilty of this; at least in the way they perceive them.

It isn't abuse, but it sure as shit not right.

I get that you are the employer, and they are the employee.  
But for fucks sake, treat them like people who have needs too.. Horrific, but sadly true, and not limited to SG. When I was child in Nigeria, the maid my parents hired was stunned that I would refer to her with respect. There's a lot of inhumane treatment going on in the maid circles and our maid actually told us that my father was the first employer who didn't try to touch her. Similar stories emerged in India. I'd say treating maids as subhuman is a problem pretty much everywhere this type of work is available. Old people tend to be highly entitled and asshole.. This is also the reason singapore score poorly 

Buildings and infrastructure is first world but people have third world mindset and this is due to decades of forcing down people to follow the 5C and also making life very competitive in general for everyone which kills kindness. Super screwed up. The maids taking care of the kids or elderly at the coffeeshop also eat the children's leftovers. Seriously third world mentality. 

''if you want to know a person, look at how he treats his underlings/inferiors, not his equals''. I don't understand how people that can afford to hire maid to be so cheapskate to only let the maid eat leftovers that the children can't finish. Will saving that couple dollars make that much of a difference?. It's this type of behaviour which is why Tommy Koh said we are essentially third-world people living in a first-world city. It is very common for many Singaporeans to have ""dog eye see people low"" and treat people accordingly to their perceived status. I'd say it's more common if the bosses are old. For some reason, old people tend to see them as ""outsiders"" who deserve the bare minimum in terms of treatment because they draw salary, which mind you, is damn little already. And of course some entitlement issues and a lack of empathy thrown into the mix. They might be afraid that treating the helper too well can make them less obedient. Not saying it is true for all old folks though. Just my observation, my family has a helper who takes care of my grandfather who is wheelchair bound. He treats her well and always buys her nice food and stuff out of gratitude. On the other hand, we have my grandaunt who stays with us, making sure to limit the food that the helper can eat during dinner. For example, on the helper's first day my grandaunt had her cook some western fare for us but she ended up eating indomie and egg. I asked her why this was the case and she literally said 'ayah don't care about her lah'. Obviously that was fucked up so I got my parents to talk to my grandaunt abt this and thankfully, because the helper turned out to get along pretty well with my grandaunt, she treats her a little better. So happy ending I guess. A lot of things could have gone wrong if the situation wasn't so ideal though.

&#x200B;

I would say the first thing you can do is to try and reason with the person if you know them while understanding where they are coming from. A lot of times old people do this to protect their own family. So it is important to allay their fears first. If that doesn't work, then take matters into your own hands. E.g. buying food for the maid and checking up on her more often. If that fails and the mistreatment is very serious, then call up MOM or get the helper to contact the embassy/agent. In many cases, the employer will get blacklisted from employing new helpers.. In the middle east, i heard physical and sexual abuse. That's a type of torture. Go to the police.. It's f'ed up. Sadly, it might be more common than we think, as it's not hard to hide. E.g. For cases like the one you witnessed, I imagine she's probably not allowed out of the house at all if not for the hospitalisation. The isolation, knowing the helper has no one to confide in, might be probably what emboldens some of these dirtbag employers.

There should be better accountability. Let these dirtbags be very aware that their dirty deeds won't stay hidden.

MOM currently practices some sort of face to face check in with domestic workers, but it seems to be selective. It really should be made standard across the board. Maybe even higher frequency (quarterly?) during the first year.

One MOM FAQ mentioned that there were 240,000 FDWs employed in SG in 2017. If MOM is collecting the full $300 levy on just half the cohort, that's a cool $36m??? I can't imagine why they can't commit more resources to ensuring their welfare.. so much of this kind of abuse goes unreported. shouldn‚Äôt there be an OSHA kind of thing but for domestic helpers?? or maybe a union to protect the rights and safety of domestic helpers in sg? this shouldn‚Äôt be happening.. Modern day slavery, it's shameful that people can't clean their own small apartment. My grandmother only give her maid instant noodle for lunch, it is very common. I've noticed It's an unwritten rule that the maid/helper profession in Singapore is little more than being a slave to the employer.. People like this should be persecuted and barred from hiring helpers permanently. That is damn screwed up mans. There's barely any shit on the chicken feet.. My current maid said her previous employer only gave her instant noodles to eat for a fking month. She managed to sneak out to a police station and reported them.. it's not even racist anymore it just wanton callousness and disregard for the well-being of a fellow human who IS A PART OF your family, albeit extended. Shudder to think how these people would treat total strangers if appearances didn't matter to them.. 21st century slavery. How and where do I report to? 

(sorry i really dont know cause it's my first time seeing this). It's really damn screwed up. So far the only ""meal"" i saw her employer gave her was the leftover breakfast that the ahma dont want to eat, and when the ahma went for some scans her son (i assumed) told her ""nah you eat this"". I'm like what the heck she needs the energy to take care of your mum and this is how you treat her.. Bloody hell, you can die of malnutrition eating that.. When I always hear these stories I really wonder why do this? Can't be is to save money right? Like how much is feeding an additional head gonna cost? Like if you're home cooking food, I bet the additional cost is like close to nothing???. I question the world i live in when i see such things too.. Wait what but they use mobile phones to contact to their family back in their countries.... Yeah your family experience with maids is what i saw with all my friends who has maids too, so this was a shock. It really boils down to upbringing i guess.. [deleted]. YES that's what we were saying. My ahma was like ""wah you got money to hire but no money to feed, then must as well dont hire"". 

The disturbing part was the maid was telling me ""sir (her son) said need change to expensive medicine. No money to give me buy food to eat"" and im like wtf. Then dont hire a maid.. First world country but the citizens are not first world.. Describing the employer of the maid as their ‚Äòowner‚Äô is probably part of the problem.. Malaysia maids are really part of the family. Really heartwarming to see kids treating their ""kakak"" like their own sister or something.. maid owners? as in they ‚Äúown‚Äù maids? aren‚Äôt you like supposed to hire them or something?? do people actually believe that they own the person that works for them? jesus.... You are criticising the behaviours of some Singaporeans with domestic helpers, but here you are in the same post referring to these employers as ""maid owners""? 

I'm done.. That's not enough. The maids also need to be assured that there will not be any repercussions against them.. Like what u/iama_simi_lanjiao said, the repercussions she will face is something that im worried for too. Though another fellow redditor mentioned an organisation (TWC2) and i plan to inform her about that. Thanks though!. But maids are humans too they have tastebuds that work equally well as ours.

If i have friends who mistreat maids, they probably wont be my friends anymore.. Yeahhhh i noticed for all my friends that they treated their maid like a family member (or else i'd cut off the friendship LOL). So got a little shocked when i saw that.. Honestly i am shocked to know that people treat their dosmetic workers this badly because my friends' maids are all treated like family (or else break friendship LOL). Now, through this, i realised it's a lot more common than i thought.

Am pretty sure Christ taught us to love neighbours as ourselves, pretty sure your mum wouldnt like it if someone stopped her from praying to God. But well what can we do when we were kids right haha.. It's mainly her fear i guess, she says the old patient will scold her whenever she sees the maid eating. They also dont give her good, so all these add up and she dont dare to accept food. But i was more shocked and sad that the maid declined food even when the old patient was not around (though after i explained, she accepted it). Her english is actually quite conversational as long as simple english is used, so i dont think communication barrier is much of a problem.. Have to deal with them at work and yes i agree on that. Though there are really nice ones but the ratio of the entitled ones vs the nice ones..... (without talking too much that might breach patient confidentiality) I think that old patient might be a little senile. Like she does recognise her own son but beyond that she doesnt really know her surroundings. I dont really want to interact with her too cause she's really rude, even towards the nurses. I dont want her to start making my ahma's life difficult too, since my ahma is in the same room. 

Now thinking about it, it most likely is what you described! Am glad that your grandaunt treats her better now though! Will do whatever i could to help her, the other patients' relatives noticed that too and are helping her (faith in humanity restored mans). Thank you so much!!. Yeah, chicken feet is a nice snack food but it is in no way proper *meal* food. Some people are awful.. Search report maid abuse...



Take photos, of the maid, of the employer, employer name, bed number, hospital etc. Easiest would be to get the maids details directly from the maid since u already managed to communicate/give her food. Basically as much info as possible to better help MOM with their investigation. Do it discreetly so the employers won't find out that they are facing an impending investigation. 

No human should be treated like this. They are helpers not slaves. Maids are supposed to be fed three meals a day with a palm sized amount of meat at lunch and dinner. These are [MOM‚Äôs guidelines](

I would report this to the MOM as they are essentially starving her seeing as how she‚Äôs too afraid to even accept food in front of her employer.. My guess? It's a mixture of being extreme stingyness (have seen people being happy to bargain over $1 when spending hundreds of dollars) and the need to exert control in their pathetic lives.. Just pay for her man.. i‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt mean that the employers own the maid per se... no need to kick up a fuss, maybe she just forgot the accurate term. it‚Äôs evident that the person cares for these domestic workers and there‚Äôs no reason to call her out like that. don't attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance. I think this is typical sg behavior. Get triggered by the most random thing. Imagine if how this person will treat his/her maid.. Thank you so much! I'll try my best, because she might not want to tell me her name for fear that she might get deported (it's a real risk they face if no one wants to employ them). I am able to get the ahma's name since it's a hospital, but not sure if the employer's name is her or her son. 

But yes the maid's human too, how can they deny her of her basic needs. I really hope for the best for the maid mans.. It's sad that this needs to be regulated in such a specific manner because of the abusive pieces of shit out there.. Do let her know that there are organizations in Singapore that are there specifically to help badly treated workers like her.

[TWC2]( has a support line (weekday working hours I think) for this and are experienced in helping maid abuse victims through such matters; please pass the number (6247 7001) along to her if she's reluctant to open up to you immediately or go to MOM for fear of reprisal from her employers/agency etc.. please help report. the way they she is treated is inhuman.. OMG THIS i am reluctant to report on her behalf but was thinking of slipping her a number to call but am not sure what organisation to go to.. >OMG THIS i am reluctant to report on her behalf

Please do, get all these maid abuser cunts into the cell.. Please make the report.  On a selfish note, if something terrible happens to her you will never be able to forgive yourself.  An MOM investigation will at the very least put the employer on notice that they are being scrutinized.. My only fear is that she'll be too afraid to seek help. You might still need to report to MOM in the end.",3347.0,3,142,1
39,A video about the history of Nanyang University (in Chinese),dkzbkq,2019-10-21 11:44:45,notexthere,3,0.58,8.0,"Randomly chanced upon this video whilst reading about Singapore history. I have to say it's quite a interesting and informative video. It talks about the history of Nanyang University (the Chinese-language ~~precursor to NTU today~~ (not quite, see /u/ahudi6 's comment below) which was the first (and perhaps only) Chinese-vernacular university outside of China proper and the factors which eventually lead to it being closed. Along the way he also talks about some of the issues between the Chinese-educated and the government but is surprisingly quite objective in doing so.

Must say that it is quite refreshing to see a perspective about Singapore from a foreigner.. The Chinese mandarin language school (ÂçéÊ†°) are part of history in Singapore before (GCE).. Nanyang University was closed down early on, NTU is the successor of NTI born out of NUS, they're 2 separate things despite sharing a similar name, don't think nantah is the precursor to NTU.. Its quite obvious that the previous Nanyang university had communist ideology and was not in favor of the pro-British government. The video even supported the spirit of self-sacrifice to mainland China. Just know that it is one version of Singapore history in the eyes of foreigner. Ah, my bad then. I have edited the comment accordingly.. I'm not a Nanyang University apologist and neither is the presenter. And I agree with your point that Nanyang University (be it faculty or students) had links to leftist and communist efforts, given that the presenter himself mentioned it.

Perhaps the way in which he describes the contributions of the local community and the affections that the local Chinese community had towards Nanyang University could be misconstrued to mean a culture self-sacrifice in reference to the Chinese government but personally I think the presenter handled the distinctions between the traditional Chinese who had only loyalties to China and the English-educated Chinese who had loyalties to Singapore. I think at one point he even mentioned that Singapore and China are distinct nowadays - no Chinese-ethnicity Singaporean will ever call himself a Chinese citizen.

It is a just one perspective of Singapore history (from a foreigner perhaps but I don't think it diminishes the relevance of the perspective) but it is still helpful in the understanding of Singapore history as another source or perspective on events.. I don't think I have misinterpreted the intention of the video. The presenter did not explicitly state the link of communism with Singapore's history. He did mentioned, however, that the University history cannot be found in media or news today (i.e the political clampdown of communism in SG). Its true the historical accounts were accurate but when we look at the main message of the video, its to laud the spirit of communism (title has some hints as well). Ah, I misunderstood your criticism then. Reviewing the video again, yeah I agree with what you have said.",478.0,10,1,1
40,"On this day in history, 21st October 1943: In the Cathay Building in Jap-occupied Singapore, Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose declares formation of Azad Hind (provisional govt of Free India) and declares war against Allied forces",dkyj09,2019-10-21 10:28:55,notexthere,690,0.99,44.0,"One of the poster boys for Japanese revisionists who peddle the narrative that the Pacific War was a campaign to liberate the Asians from their colonial masters.. Wow didn't know that. Way to pick a winning side.. As an Indian (now Singaporean), I shudder to think what would have happened had he succeeded. I still cannot believe that he would go from one imperialist power to another, much more brutal imperialist power.. INA ahhh, there was a huge ST forum debate about commemorating the INA or even having the INA memorial at the Esplanade. 4th gen Singaporean Indian here. Boy did this not work out. Apparently many Indians back then were inclined to listen to him cos the British obviously failed at protecting us, which was like their one job. Good thing shit didn't work out. India'd have been *way* more screwed than it is now.. I feel eerie when I went in one time during a concert. Now I know why.. Is Bose related to the founder of the Bose Hifi products. Thanks for this OP, I had a very educational morning just going through the comments! More please :). A great leader!. Bose apparently has a very controversial status in India. Bose represented the militaristic/guerrilla faction of Indian independence fighters, and Gandhi represented the pacifist wing. Those that support Gandhi call Bose a fascist because of his ties to Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan; those that support Bose call Gandhi a weakling.

At the end of the day, it was really Britain's destruction during WWII and the rise of the United States as a global superpower that brought about the end of the British Empire, beginning with the emancipation of India, and ending with the decolonisation of SEA and Africa. Gandhi and Bose nailed the Brits hard, but they weren't the final nails in the coffin.

It's also worth stating that Bose was effectively the Lim Bo Seng for the ancestors of a not-insignificant number of the contemporary Singaporean Indian populace, particularly the Tamils and Sikhs. There were Indians who were oppressed and butchered by the Japs and thus repudiated anyone allied with them (like Bose's Indian National Army), but there were those that saw the British as a greater evil and threw in their lot with Bose. History is complicated.. Oh, but it was a war to liberate the Asians from their colonial masters. So as to put them under a new colonial master.. One of the reasons that Bose hardly features in Singapore and Malayan history or narrative of any sort was that his presence and influence was essentially a non-event.

Indian pioneers and residents in Singapore at that time was members of Tamil and Kerala,  communities, both from the South who threw in their lot with British more than a century ago and who arrived to take on many roles especially in the civil service, railways and shipyards. Bose was a northerner and him and his politics did not appeal to local Indians. 

Knowing this, the Japanese attempted to get Indian POWs from Northern regiments to fall behind Bose. When this failed, the Japanese forced members of their Sikh regiments to face the firing squad. That too failed. The only thing left was to create propaganda proses and narratives of Bose and his Army which remains in one‚Äôs imagination. 

In summary, Bose despite Japanese propaganda had no influence with local Indians Singapore nor with the majority of Indian POWs. Sikh POWs, made their case clear on where their loyalty lies. 

I also think that Singaporeans who are well versed with their war time history do not take it lightly when someone‚Äôs comes up with another Bose narrative and use Japanese propaganda photos and docs to make a non-event real. We are more concerned with Sook Ching and how it scarred so many families.. It really wasn‚Äôt that easy for the Japanese to conquer India, to begin with. India has never been conquered from the east. The Himalayas and dense jungle separate northeast India from Burma, and the Japanese picked the worst location through which to conquer the country - though they had no choice. The Japs couldn‚Äôt have conquered India from the west, because that would‚Äôve required a footing in either Iran or Afghanistan, which they did not have. Since Burma was already occupied by them, thrusting into NE India from SEA was the more realistic choice.

Also, the British-allied Indian forces were composed of ferocious ‚Äúwarrior race‚Äù regiments (Gurkhas, Afghan Pashtuns, Sikhs, Marathas) - and there is no way the Japs, as bloodthirsty as they were, could‚Äôve ever fought them on an equal footing. 

They could‚Äôve theoretically conquered the country from the sea, but their naval resources were concentrated in the Pacific, which was a critical area for Imperial Japan to exert control over.

But for the sake of entertaining hypotheticals: Had the INA and the Japanese succeeded, the Japanese would‚Äôve had direct access to India‚Äôs vast trove of resources and the military-industrial complex that the British and Indian industrialists established. The developed network of railways and ports would‚Äôve allowed for Japan to plunder India dry (a double whammy after Brit thievery) and ship its resources to Japan to fuel the war machine. Japan would‚Äôve also been able to retard the outflow of millions of Indian troops to European and Asian WWII theatres, leaving the Allies to fend for themselves against the Axis. 

It would‚Äôve dramatically changed the course of the war, but I reckon the Allies would‚Äôve still won at the end of the day - provided they were willing to resort to bloodier measures to bring an end to the war. I reckon the US would‚Äôve most definitely needed to drop more nukes to get the job done. 

The death toll would‚Äôve been larger by orders of magnitude. There would‚Äôve been tens of millions of Indians killed in new famines or outright butchery under Japanese occupation, India‚Äôs independence would‚Äôve probably been delayed by decades, India would‚Äôve been a basket case of a country today, Europe would‚Äôve been destroyed even further, Southeast Asia (since the Japanese occupation would‚Äôve been lengthened) would‚Äôve faced a worse fate, the northern parts of Australia would‚Äôve probably suffered a Japanese incursion (they already bombed Darwin)... and Malaysia and Singapore, at least as we know it, would likely not exist in their present forms. Who‚Äôs to say LKY wouldn‚Äôt have been targeted by the Japs had the occupation been lengthened? What would‚Äôve happened to Mahathir? There are too many variables to consider.

And what about China? Had Japan‚Äôs occupation of China been lengthened because of Indian resources fuelling its war machine, how differently would the PRC/ROC dynamics have played out? What government would China be under today? Would Mao even exist?

Way too many variables!. The NHB marker near the Padang is technically not a memorial. It's a neutral heritage marker that marks the historical importance of the spot. The real memorial was blown up by the Brits when they returned after the Japanese occupation. In that respect, the marker is no different to the various markers that merely mark the spots (not ""commemorate"" - there's a difference) where Japanese atrocities were committed, like the one in Changi beach, where the infamous Sook Ching was carried out.

The marker is absolutely necessary, because only third world and insecure countries engage in acts of iconoclasm and outright erasure. If we were that kind of country, we'd have toppled the statue of Raffles, Saddam-style, a long time ago. But that's just a waste of time and energy. It's important to be objective about history.

The only people that seem to be offended by the INA marker are angmohs and Anglophiles of all backgrounds, particularly Brit/Anglo military-worshiping jingoists that consider the INA and its recruits ""traitors"". Traitors for opposing the scourge of whyte imperialism? That'd make the entire Asian continent traitorous. It's a badge of honour if anything.. India is actually doing fine considering the absolute state the country was in right after the Brits raped it to fill their coffers (for which they must never be forgiven). Third largest economy (PPP GDP), robust liberal parliamentary democracy, sensible enough to repeal 377 (unlike us), modern MRT in every major city, burgeoning domestic aviation market, high speed rail system in its infancy, skyscraper boom, growing civic consciousness... it‚Äôs no Singapore, but it could‚Äôve been far worse. 

I don‚Äôt know anything about the country‚Äôs social dynamics (religious conflict, caste, treatment of women) because even though I‚Äôm ethnically Indian, like you, I‚Äôve been Singaporean for so many generations that I‚Äôm no longer culturally Indian (well like the virtual majority of young Singaporeans anyway) but from a strictly economic/political standpoint things seem pretty swell.. Different Bose. Amar Bose. Yup, great post u/botoxilum! Love the commentaries in this thread too, I've learned something new from this.. That‚Äôs a really good breakdown of Bose‚Äôs legacy. In general he‚Äôs well liked in India because he lost. The Indian National Army (INA) participated in a few battles in Burma and in the extreme north-east of India, but it never got anywhere. 

Because the INA never made it to India proper, it‚Äôs easy for Indians to hand-wave the Japanese and German connections and say he was a patriot, but perhaps he went about it the wrong way.

If he had succeeded and brought the Japanese Empire into India, I suspect he would be much more controversial.. Empire of britain have been on a downward turn long before the ww2. That's an excellent summary. But politics, especially the subcontinent politics are very complex.. I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting your historical facts from, because this is not true. Any historian would be able debunk your ahistorical ‚Äúfacts‚Äù, which are more polemical than factual. 

>	hardly features in Singapore and Malayan history or narrative of any sort was that his presence and influence was essentially a non-event.

No, he hardly features in local historical narratives for three reasons:

a) his impact was strictly limited to the Indian community, and local historical narratives tend to centre around the majority group (Sook Ching);

b) Singaporean Indians have become nativised to the country, and each successive generation has forgotten the figureheads that the previous generation championed. For example, the ancestors of Chinese Singaporeans championed Chang Kai-Shek ‚Äì today he‚Äôs inconsequential to most young Chinese Singaporeans. 

c) Post-independence, our state-crafted historical narratives tend to focus more on things that concern the entire country in order for the citizenry to find common ground (Sang Nila Utama, Raffles, shared suffering during WWII, Merdeka, Singapore in Malaysia, LKY, etc). 

Consider the case of Lieutenant Adnan Saidi, who barely even appears in our history books, but he‚Äôs an extremely important figure to the Malay community nonetheless. This does not mean Adnan Saidi is inconsequential. He‚Äôs simply become a footnote of history in the modern Singaporean state. 

>	Indian pioneers and residents in Singapore at that time was members of Tamil and Kerala, communities, both from the South who threw in their lot with British more than a century ago and who arrived to take on many roles especially in the civil service, railways and shipyards. 

Did you just erase the Sikhs, Bengalis, and Gujarati Muslims? Singapore‚Äôs Indian community has been heterogeneous from the very start. The late President SR Nathan‚Äôs wife is from a Bengali background. Even though these Indian communities are smaller in demographic profile, they are very much an integral part of the nation‚Äôs history, and do not deserve to be erased (and there are more).  

>	Bose was a northerner and him and his politics did not appeal to local Indians.

Wrong. Bose was not a North Indian, and the vast majority of INA recruits from Singapore were Tamil, followed by Sikhs. You really need to pick up that history book stat. Of the 60,000 Indian troops in Singapore defending the island from the Japanese, roughly 10,000 defected to the INA - and most of the 10,000 were the ancestors of the contemporary Singaporean Tamil populace, followed by Sikhs. 

>	Knowing this, the Japanese attempted to get Indian POWs from Northern regiments to fall behind Bose.

The Japanese manipulated the Indians along a north-south divide? Nah. Already debunked as explained above. 

>	When this failed, the Japanese forced members of their Sikh regiments to face the firing squad.

The Sikh regiments faced the firing squad for the simple reason that they refused to join the INA. Some Sikh regiments defected to the INA, some refused out of honour. The ones that were shot were the latter. 

>	Bose despite Japanese propaganda had no influence with local Indians Singapore nor with the majority of Indian POWs. Sikh POWs, made their case clear on where their loyalty lies.

You‚Äôre saying this because you‚Äôre perceiving history through a ‚Äúpresentist‚Äù lens, which is a mistake many amateurs make. The contemporary German population wouldn‚Äôt dare identify with a Hitler-like figure, yet for their parents and grandparents, Hitler was a demigod. Therefore what we identify with was not what our grandparents or their parents identified with. 

>	I also think that Singaporeans who are well versed with their war time history do not take it lightly when someone‚Äôs comes up with another Bose narrative and use Japanese propaganda photos and docs to make a non-event real. We are more concerned with Sook Ching and how it scarred so many families.

This is a post for the sole purpose of documenting Singapore‚Äôs wartime history. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre triggered, but you‚Äôve made it evidently clear that you have an ahistorical reading of history that is influenced by some kind of strange, convoluted, possibly foreign agenda that has no place here. 

Speaking of Sook Ching: Ask any local historian worth their salt, and they‚Äôll tell you that Sook Ching was a tragedy for the Chinese community alone - not the Malays and Indians. There was no ‚ÄúSingaporean‚Äù or ‚ÄúMalaysian‚Äù identity back then, just disparate races living in a territory ruled by the Brits (and then Japs). Anybody with even the slightest grasp of history will know that every ethnic group had trials and tribulations that were specific to them. 

A Tamil coolie would‚Äôve faced a very different set of tribulations to a Eurasian lawyer. There was no sense of shared suffering. That is a creation of the modern Singaporean state, and you are conflating state narratives with an objective reading of history.. check out r/TNOmod for an interesting alt hist scenario!. Thanks for your reply, it‚Äôs really eye-opening to take into account all possible outcomes of history :). Eh the person who raged mode on the ST forum were Chinese whose relatives were killed by the Japanese. Given the close links between the Japanese and INA.... welp same here bro. we're both too far detached to accurately tell. but yea. could have been worse.. > If he had succeeded and brought the Japanese Empire into India, I suspect he would be much more controversial.

My mainland Indian (Sikh) friends with a familial history of multiple generations serving in the Indian Army and the British Indian Army have a deep, visceral hatred of Bose and his compadres. They call his supporters 'brainless', and say that had the Japanese not been defeated in northeastern India by the Allied forces, they would have rampaged past the Indo-Gangetic plains and turned northern India into another Nanking. 

Yet it was also the British that destroyed Sikh sovereignty by ending the Sikh Empire in northwestern India and Afghanistan, thus ending the last bastion of self-rule in the subcontinent. So in a sense it's quite ironic that Sikhs from India would detest the Japs and defend the Brits, but that's apparently what happens. There is no singular colonial/WWII narrative, and it's fascinating.

It would seem as if Japanese-Indian allyship during WWII was for purposes of political expedience, not because the Japanese actually held any affinity towards the Indians (as some Indians claim) or because the Indians held affinity towards the Japanese (it was a devil or the deep blue sea type of situation). They shared a common enemy, and that was it. When you think about it, the politically expedient WWII relationship between Japan and India was a far cry from the amicable cultural relationship the two civilisations historically shared. Japan was culturally enriched by India (either via China or directly) in the ancient and medieval era, receiving Buddhism, the liturgical script (Siddham) and language (Pali), Indic architectural elements (Torii gate), Hindu-Buddhist deities (Benzaiten, Kangiten), and more. In fact, if I recall correctly, the imperial Japanese played up this sense of ""shared heritage"" to Bose and the INA in order to cultivate feelings of affinity between the two forces.. Understandable. Though at the end of the day it's a cookie-cutter NHB marker, not a memorial. Rebuilding the memorial would've been inappropriate - agreed.

When was this anyway? Must've been quite a while back since I can't remember when the marker was installed.. > My mainland Indian (Sikh) friends with a familial history of multiple generations serving in the Indian Army and the British Indian Army have a deep, visceral hatred of Bose and his compadres. They call his supporters 'brainless', and say that had the Japanese not been defeated in northeastern India by the Allied forces, they would have rampaged past the Indo-Gangetic plains and turned northern India into another Nanking.

He was literally chumming up to Hitler in Berlin during WW2. Had his army gained ground, India would certainly have ended up as a Nazi and/or Imperial Japanese puppet, with anyone opposing their rule (or suspected of doing so) mercilessly killed.



Maybe Bose himself could be excused, by possibly being unaware of Axis atrocities, but that doesn't apply to modern-day supporters of Bose.. Couple of years back.

I think it there a documentary or op-ed about INA and the writer talked about INA/Bose and their role decolonization and how there was memorial at the Esplanade.

Then rage modeeeeeeeee. > India would certainly have ended up as Nazi and/or Imperial Japanese puppets

Like The Man in the High Castle. I can't wait for season 4 üòã

It's quite strange that India's current PM [publicly admires]( Bose. It's almost like an Indian version of Shinzo Abe visiting the Yasukuni Shrine (well it's not exactly the same, but you get my drift).. Bose himself wasn‚Äôt really a fascist, in the WW2-era sense. He was a strong believer in authoritarian socialism, and was somewhat progressive on some topics (the Azad Hind ‚Äúcabinet‚Äù had quite a few Muslim and female members). His willingness to work with the Axis powers can be chalked up to two things - that he was (possibly) unaware of the atrocities that they were committing, and his policy of ‚Äúthe enemy of my enemy is my friend‚Äù. To him, the British were the first enemy who were oppressing the Indian people, and so he felt it was necessary to work alongside the Axis.. I quite like our national approach to history. Acknowledge (but not necessarily commemorate if contentious). That‚Äôs big dick energy. Iconoclasm = small dick energy. 

Not acknowledging integral aspects of this country‚Äôs history because it‚Äôs ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù would open a can of worms. Raffles‚Äô acquisition of Singapore from the Johor Sultanate was problematic for the Malays. It laid the groundwork for the fracturing of the indigenous Malay polity and turned them from a once-proud sovereign people into serfs of the whyte man. But for the Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Armenians, and Baghdadi Jews, it laid the groundwork for their settlement. 

So should we topple Raffles‚Äô statue as a mark of respect to indigeneity, or keep it up because he‚Äôs an integral part of this country‚Äôs history? (and mind you, I utterly detest Brit imperialism). How about this: Instead of acting like children, how about we focus our energies towards correcting the historical injustices that hold the Malay community back, many of which can be traced back to the colonial era?

Almost every historical event has opposing narratives clamouring for supremacy. The best thing to do is to leave things as they are and get on with our lives. As the LKY meme goes: ‚ÄùStop complaining. Get back to work.‚Äù. Agree. It never crossed my mind.
""Indian version of Shinzo Abe visiting the Yasukuni Shrine "". > It's quite strange that India's current PM publicly admires Bose.

it's a little complicated, but the short version is:

Bose and Gandhi were at diametric odds when it came to liberating India. He was not a fan of the whole non-violence thing Gandhi espoused. A significant number of people supported Bose's philosophy of ""stronger"" action.

In current politics, Gandhi's legacy is intertwined with the Congress party, which is still an active party and the main contender to the incumbent BJP party, which Modi is a part of. [Supporting Bose is lowkey political flexing that the BJP has a claim in the history of India's independence too](, just like the Congress (who constantly bring up Gandhi in their campaigns). The Yuushukan Museum at Yasukini Shrine actually has a picture of Bose if I'm not wrong. Went there a few years back and there was a panel with all the leaders who had collaborated with the Japanese at the end of the exhibits.

I can see this happening in the future though. Modi visiting Yasukuni with Abe, thanking the Japanese for helping liberate India and saluting Bose.. His party admires the killers of Gandhi, what do you expect.. > Bose himself wasn‚Äôt really a fascist, in the WW2-era sense. He was a strong believer in authoritarian socialism, and was somewhat progressive on some topics (the Azad Hind ‚Äúcabinet‚Äù had quite a few Muslim and female members).

It's not very valid to impose modern-day definitions of progressivism on a man who died 70+ years ago. Having more Muslims and females in America today would be seen as progressive, as the alt-right doesn't want to see them in power. But Hitler's Nazis were ok with Bose having an interracial marriage with a white Austrian woman in Berlin, while at the same time they were murdering on sight Poles and Russians (seen as white by most alt-righters today). Also, Hitler admired Islam and Arabs. Bose recruiting Muslims while part of the Axis Powers can't really be seen as progressive.

Besides, authoritarian socialism... is literally what the Nazis identified as too (Nazi = Nationalsozialist = National Socialist), and nowadays most people just call them ""fascist"" rather than ""socialists of the national, authoritarian sort"".. >	Modi visiting Yasukuni with Abe, thanking the Japanese for helping liberate India and saluting Bose.

Then India will become Asia‚Äôs next pariah state. Imagine offending the rest of East Asia and all of Southeast Asia to curry favour (no pun intended) with the Japanese. Who are no doubt powerful in their own right, but is an alliance with one nation worth earning the ire of the entire continent?. I meant progressive in that respect from an Indian point of view, where religious tensions were at an all time high and the pro-partition Muslim League was seen as the true representative of Indian Muslims. On top of that, with women, women‚Äôs rights were still very limited, whether that was by law or through cultural pressure.. Indians were believed to be part of the ‚ÄòAryan‚Äô race as well, something which Ghandi himself espoused to explain the superiority of Indians and Caucasians and the inferiority of the blacks in Africa. You never know. We live in a timeline where a reality TV star is the President of USA and that guy has effectively destroyed American hegemony which took them 70 years to build up.

You also have China. At the end of the day, it's all about geopolitics. We now talk about the Indo-Pacific region, not the Asia-Pacific. If  relations between China and India worsen, I definitely can see it happening. South Korea might be pissed but the rest of SEA will probably keep quiet. China is now the bigger issue and it's always about realpolitik. 

Interesting and unpredictable times indeed.. Ah, agreed then.. I used to think Trump was playing 4D chess. Now he just seems like a simp who genuinely has no idea what he‚Äôs doing. Honestly this is why I‚Äôm somewhat averse to democracy and much prefer the hybrid system we‚Äôve got.

Why are you quoted higher than Samsung itself?. For The repair price might as well u buy another phone tbh. Regardless, make sure to be VERY careful when purchasing or switching your screen.

Following this, I saw less and less Toyota Crown taxis on the road and Sonatas took their place. And now the Sonatas are the ones being phased out in favour of newer models like the i40, Prius, Ioniq HEV/EV and the Kona EV.   
   
Every time I board a Sonata and reach my destination, I‚Äôll snap some photos with my phone as they won‚Äôt be around for much longer. And many of the Sonatas I‚Äôve previously boarded have been replaced with newer models, making my photos a thing I can keep for memory.  
  
Though not everyone is as enthusiastic about taxis as I am, it‚Äôs legitimately quite sad to see less and less Sonatas on our roads.. And the start of the Hyundai Ioniq Era. whats the most recent ones now? I always thought Sonata is still new. The new hyundai taxis legroom is terrible. I miss the toyata crown.. The era of the cheapest taxi rides have come to an end. Do the taxis have that ‚Äútwinkling‚Äù speed chime? Prevalent in the Crowns/Coronas and the Cedrics have that beep-beep chime.. Cue the taxi otakus. Taxis in Singapore retire too fast no thanks to the distorted evil that is call COE. Will it every be possible to import an older Toyota crown after another 10-15 years under the classic car scheme, then wrap yellow and put the city cab sticker?. My dad drives one of these, says he‚Äôs gonna be sad to see it go. It‚Äôs like when the Crown was phased out haha I feel like a bit of my childhood disappears every time a taxi model disappears :‚Äô). I will miss the cab. But won‚Äôt miss all the pandan smell it brings along. A very traumatic smell even after more than a decade. Always having migraines after getting off cabs with like 10 bunch of pandan all around.. Crown - Sonata - and few Silverline / Scoda cars. Miss those ones. Plenty of boot space, legroom and easy to recognize from a distance. Added to that, a cousin bought the Blue Sonata in 2004, and in a short while, Comfort decided to deploy hundreds of Sonata :). The new era is Honda vezel. Really miss those. I still remember boarding one of the light blue ones when I was a toddler and with my mom and remember the driver telling me that it would be scrapped soon. I miss the Cedric more. Seems a lot more stylish to me. Probably why I have an interest in boxy and angular cars until now.. I remember way back, when the tiny Toyota ~~Corollas~~ Coronas formed bulk of the taxi fleet, getting a Toyota Crown was like hitting jackpot.. >  Toyota Crown

lol they had a very particular scent to them. i'd call it the ""taxi scent"". i can't remember the last time i saw one on the streets, they just mysteriously vanished.. I distinctly remember the way they rattled. I remember the chime from the speed limiter once the driver crosses 100km/h.. I think most modern taxi smell is fine. Old taxis made me nauseous last time. Blame the PVC upholstery and constant sunlight.. It‚Äôs the VOC. So comfy. My favourite part was the boxy design, as with most cars from the 80‚Äôs. Hyundai Ioniq HEV/EV, i40, Kona EV and Prius. Constant Beep beep beep for the entire time on the PIE.. I brought a living room rug home from IKEA in the cabin of a Crown once. That would be impossible in today's taxis.. >Cedric 

Believe still quite prevalent in HKG.. What car u wanna buy next time. Especially some that had the blue seats! Those were just so cool. I remember the day my dad swapped from the Cedric to the Sonata, and it just didn't feel the same. Really missing the grunt of the 2L diesel.. I used to see this taxi..i think a wheelchair can't fit in the trunk & they have to used the elastic rope with hook to secure the trunk.. Ahh, the Cedric and it's legendary engine vibrations reverberating throughout the car.. I think that was the Corona with round headlights.. taxi drivers often used pandan leaves as air fresheners, maybe that's why they all smelt like that. The rear suspension on its last legs made for a rough in the back seat.. That's the driver shifting up to 4th/5th gear far too early in a bid to save diesel. It is such joy when you meet one that shifts at the correct point and gives a smooth ride.. I have never paid attention to a Kona EV taxi before until I googled one now. wow... Japan too. Always wanted an MX-5, but not the most practical choice.

Would probably go for a previous gen Civic Type-R or any other enthusiast cars.Bonus if it's a manual. Although I would love to see what 90s cars would still be available.. Shoot, you're right, it's the Corona!. miata is always the answer bro. There's a suzuki cappucino for sale.... There are still s2000 for sale, tho quite overpriced. Would still suggest getting type r instead. Wished we had supra.. you can try look out for good condition used EF series Civics. sometimes you can come across a nice gem. Don't those things happen to be LTA magnets tho? Unless you're talking about a completely clean, stock one.. yes the stock ones are what i mean. really hard to come by but if you can by god are they so awesome and fun",1017.0,15,1,1

You don't say.. ""At the time, he ""felt stressed about his financial situation and his relationship problems with his girlfriend"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Samuel Lim.
""As a result, the accused felt the urge to take a video of the victim showering,"" he said.""

Showers can relieve stress.. But not like this... Don't these people read online news??. Why he never kena probation?. Is his GPA high enough to warrant a free jail card?. The simple solution to this is a wank away. Pity.. Low-GPA poly students should not be taking videos of women showering.. Polytechnic.  If he were an NTU dean lister the court may just order him to write an apology letter and thats it. Guess his GPA wasn't high enough. Can anyone enlighten on the technicality on why is this different from the NUS case?. > # Polytechnic student jailed for taking video of woman showering

> SINGAPORE: A 24-year-old took a video of a woman showering after he felt stressed about this financial situation and relationship problems, a court was told.

> Edmund Chong was sentenced on Monday (Oct 21) after he was caught filming a 40-year-old tenant who was living in his grandmother's home. The victim had seen his phone above the toilet door and directed the shower head at his device before calling for help.

> Advertisement

> For his actions, Chong was jailed for seven weeks.

> The court heard that Chong stayed at his grandmother's home on Mondays and Tuesdays as it was nearer to Temasek Polytechnic, where he was studying.

> His grandmother rented out a room to the victim, a Malaysian national.

> At about 8.30pm on May 14 this year, Chong was at his grandmother's house while the elderly woman went out to see a doctor. The victim was taking a shower in the kitchen washroom.

> At the time, he ""felt stressed about his financial situation and his relationship problems with his girlfriend"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Samuel Lim.

> ""As a result, the accused felt the urge to take a video of the victim showering,"" he said.

> He went to the toilet, where the door did not extend fully to the ceiling, and perched his arm on top of the door while holding a OnePlus 6T mobile phone.

> He turned on the camera function and recorded a video of the victim, who was showering at the time, the court heard.

> About five minutes later, the victim sensed something amiss and looked around to see the black mobile phone pointed towards her from the top of the toilet door.

> She quickly directed the shower head at the phone and sprayed water at it.

> Chong realised he had been caught and retracted his hand, while the woman stopped showering and put on her clothes before leaving the toilet and going to her room to calm down.

> She told her work supervisors about what had happened and called the police, while Chong knocked repeatedly on her door.

> The police later arrived at the home and Chong admitted to his actions. Officers seized his phone, laptop and laptop charger.

> Chong, who was unrepresented, pleaded guilty on Monday to one charge of intruding upon the victim's privacy with the intention to insult her modesty.

> ACCUSED SAYS HE DOES NOT WANT TO GET A LAWYER

> District Judge Adam Nakhoda asked Chong if he wished to engage a lawyer to help with mitigation, but Chong said he did not.

> The prosecutor sought at least eight weeks' jail, noting that while Chong did not save the video, he knew the victim as she was his grandmother's tenant.

> 

> ""The victim was showering fully unclothed so the act of video-taking was fully intrusive,"" said the prosecutor.

> Chong spoke softly in his mitigation and was prompted by the court interpreter to speak up.

> ""I know that I did something wrong,"" he said. ""I only wish to have a chance because I finally have a chance to get into poly to further my studies and I don't want to miss that opportunity.""

> The judge said that while he agreed with the prosecutor on some of his submissions, he felt that some of the factors in a similar case cited as a precedent for this were ""more egregious than the current case"", and imposed a week's less jail than the prosecution had asked for.

> 

> The phone was forfeited while the charger and laptop were ordered to be returned to Chong.

> For intruding upon the privacy of a woman to insult her modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year, fined, or both.

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( Edmund Chong again? The same guy that threw egg at Minister?. Not worth it. What can you capture? Unless the woman does not have a Bush and has extremely protruding roast beef flaps, the former being highly unlikely for a 40 year old asian woman.. Damn this guy's like, ""Hey I'm broke and my gf dw me ardy.. OOH I KNOW I'LL WATCH A 40 Y/O LADY SHOWER NAKEY MMMM""

?????? wot ??????. Is this always the same person or it's an argument that is covered in some courses?. whats up with the recent surge of incel behaviour in Sg?. Does that get him a direct entry to NUS now?. Because poly max gpa is only 4.0. What a slut. You shower naked 

EEEEEWW. Because he never study at the National University of Sex.. Because only Poly. laugh guys I said LAUGH. guess poly GPA isn't considered a real GPA for the judge to make the judgement.. Must also be from elite educational institution. He already failed the first part. /s. [deleted]. Usually the judges will take into account how likely would the perp reoffend. They use things like pre existing records or education as a metric. 

I guess in this case they deemed that he was more likely to reoffend than in the NUS case. (Which honestly i dont agree with, the NUS student has a few priors). pls dont ask rhetorical questions. That one is zhong.. Surge? It‚Äôs always been here. Peeping toms have been a thing since my parents time. The only difference is now we have widely available cameras and social networks.. He has a girlfriend. Mean while nice guy yandao redditors are the true incels. Singapore has long been a thriving hub of incels.. The behaviour has always been there, just that these types of news are getting more coverage recently. Also, there's this cycle where a person sees news like this and think to themselves why don't they try it too. Then they get caught, the news report them, someone else sees that and tries it and the cycle keeps continuing. People don't always learn from the consequences someone else got from the bad things they do. Sometimes all they see is validation for what they have been wanting to do all along.

NSFW BELOW:

When I say the behavior has always been there, just go Google voyeur porn and you'll see how many there are and how far it dates back to.

The irony of this comment is that someone may see this, Google that and gets the thought of trying voyeurism themselves.. Police might be too effective. Time to throw cases out to reduce crime rate.. I lol‚Äôd irl. not big brain enough for good results, never think through. you don't have to put /S on a true statement.

P.S. Am from poly myself.. /whoosh. Username checks out.. What he was implying is that:

Unlike high GPA student with a ""get out of jail free"" card, low GPA student don't have the luxury to bank on their ""bright future"" to shield them from the law.

This meme came from the decision made by the court regarding several outrages of modesty cases where the perps have high GPA and was let off lightly so as not to tarnish their ""bright future"".. U OOTL. You must understand the demographic of the ppl here. Rn the current formula for upvotes is : See outrage of modesty post = Must mention about GPA

Post anything controversial and prepare to sink. You have my upvote though. It ain't much but its honest work. Name checks out. I see, looking at it from this angle is definitely more objective than how news agencies are sensationlising the issue. 

But yeah I disagree with how the NUS case was handled too. I have multiple partners. You wish you were me. Now you are blocked..

Spoken like a true incel! You really know how they operate, eh? No wonder you can detect the rise in incel behaviours so easily.. Don't take my word for it though. What I said was based on headlines. You should go read it up if you are interested in the cases and why they got off lightly. I seem to remember a few of them plead mental issues.. There is. And its getting old.

45,Singapore‚Äôs Navin Param after his match winning 72* off 41 in a nail-biter vs Bermuda,dkxsk7,2019-10-21 09:10:31,notexthere,33,0.88,10.0,"Man imagine if there were some Chinese on that team, the attention they‚Äôd get. I'm no cricket fan but 72 to 41 sounds like quite a landslide win rather than a nail-biter. So we are getting good at this now?. Honestly after decades I still don‚Äôt understand cricket rules. Last time when they announced our sch won a competition by xx runs to some jargon, everyone one just cheered yay we win but no one really understood how and why.

But yay we win wohoo sg boleh!‚Äô. d0nt be racist, the players are doing everything they can to bring singapore in the world cup. It was a nail biter because Singapore won with only 2 balls to spare. Looking at the scorecard, Navin played a crucial innings scoring consistently at almost 2 runs per ball which is insanely good. If he didn't play at the pace he did, Singapore could have lost the match.. That's his individual score. 72*/41 means 72 (not out) from 41 balls. Each ball he has the opportunity to score anywhere from 0 to 6 (usually). He is also the 6th batsman (where the batsmen are usually weaker, so his run rate is impressive given the amount he had to chase, where he had 7 4s (hit the boundary) and 4 6s (over the boundary). None of the other SG batsmen had a run rate higher than 1.

The final score is Singapore 152/5 (152 runs, 5 out) and Bermuda 149/7 (149 runs, 7 out). Bermuda took the whole 20 overs (each over is 6 balls, so that's 120 balls), while Singapore chased the same target in 19.3 overs (so 3 balls less). So yes, it would have been quite the nail biter.

When Navin took the pitch, Singapore was 41/4 at 8.4 over (52 deliveries). So Navin and Manpreet now have 68(*?) deliveries to get another 108 runs, which Navin made the majority of as Manpreet eventually fell in in over 17.1 with **only** 26 runs, another astonishing number as the better batsmen usually bat higher in the order. This left Navin 23 balls(*?) to chase another 29 runs. 

This is a high pressure situation at the end because the batsmen have to make riskier shots to get boundaries, and because the 7th batsman Janak is usually a weaker batsman Navin also has to defend his partner by ""maintaining the strike"" - i.e. the partnership has to work together to keep the better/in-form batsman on strike so they can score more. Seems like they did quite well with this. Janak only faced 3 deliveries out of the last 14 balls. This also means the majority of Navin's scoring in that last few overs were mostly the riskier boundary shots

Then like a chad he slams a Four while the score is at 148 (i.e. only need 1 run to tie), hence the score being 152 over 149.



(*) there are 12 ""extras"" which are awarded for mistakes by the fielding team and they add up, but no info on when they occurred during the match.. let's try some layman language.

This is Twenty20, a format where both teams get to bowl only 20 overs, each over has 6 deliveries at least so total 120 deliveries. We say 120 balls in crickets to save time n effort. If the bowler bowls a no ball where the Umpire deemed the delivery not possible to hit, the batting team gets a free hit, u can't get out even if caught (like in baseball).

as there are only so little deliveries, most of the time batters 6 to 11 are not expected to bat long or to score much runs as they are in the team to either keep wicket or to bowl. Normally a team will play 4 bowlers and maybe 1 all rounder (a player whose skills in both batting and bowling are good enough)

needing 41 deliveries to score 72 is not excellent if we are talking abt the superstars of this format. If you are curious, Chris Gayle's record in T20 is by far the most impressive. He blasted a score of 175 not out off 66 deliveries. Of which he reached 100 by 30. What \*IS\* excellent is that this was happening at the death. Captains always save the bowler who restrict the scoring to the last. The format has been around for a while now and captains have had some of the ""meta"" sorted out. If the bowler is accurate and can bowl at the stumps the angle makes scoring much more difficult due to lack of room to expand the shot. Reckless swinging can result in missing the ball and getting clean bowled.

Cricket is a wonderful game :). that's the thing, he isn't being racist. It's just factual.. the game always had the ""label"" of being an south Asian game here in the region. I personally feel these slugfest suit our.... tastes. It is just that the game is not as appealing as a spectator sport",826.0,15,1,1
46,Need help in making relocation decision,dkwvx4,2019-10-21 07:26:56,"Hi guys. I am from India. I got a job at a respected place in Singapore. they are offering me 7500 sgd per month, plus year end variable that's 2 month's salary on average.

The help I seek from you guys is, is that salary good enough for me, my wife, and my pet dog to be in Singapore, renting a 1/2bhk furnished flat? Is that a decent salary to be in Singapore?",0,0.28,26.0,"Wah ceca also get big money. Amdk not satki anymore.. How old are you?. Bring dogs in could have some process and quarantine, do check it up first.. as long as you can get healthcare for the whole family sure. Conservatively:
Rent: 2.5k
Food and Transport: 1.5k
Utilities and other expenses:1k
So left with 2 to 2.5k before tax.

May I ask what industry you're in?. Yes. Salary of 7500 sgd a month? That's a lot 

Renting a 1/2bhk furnished flat?. No it's terrible. You'll have to beg for scraps.. How is that compared to what you are currently earning?. $2000/mth can easily get you a 2 bedroom HDB apartment. $5,500 balance to feed 2 pax may be a bit tight but you won't starve nor live in luxury.. 36. I do get it for myself and my spouse. Education. Obviously IT. It's Indian terminology for renting a 1/2 bedroom + hall + kitchen flat. Ya. Might have to eat jiam tao roti for all 3 meals.

Wtf are u eating. Depending on what field you‚Äôre in, that may or may not be a decent salary given your age/experience. However, it will be enough for you to live in Singapore but you‚Äôd be looking at rent of around $3-3.5k per month for a 1 or 2-bedroom unit in a condo in a relatively central area. There are other options, such as HDB, but you need to check if your dog is allowed as there are different rules. Check out a website called PropertyGuru to get an idea of rent. 

Having a pet in Singapore is expensive, so you‚Äôll need to factor that in as well and unless you keep your living costs low, you may find that you‚Äôd only be saving a small amount of money every month given that it‚Äôs 7.5k for your wife, dog, and yourself.. Wow. Way to jump the gun on that one.. I‚Äôm sure you can save more than $2500/mth. 

Getting your pet dog in will be quite cumbersome. 

You had better let the landlord know you have a pet.. $2.25k/pax/mth much leh.... Thanks a lot for the detail. My dog is a pomeranian-golden cross, and I have checked the prohibited dogs list in Singapore, where I couldn't find mention of such a dog. However, i will definitely be very clear about that while I look for a place.

You said having a pet in sg is expensive. How much, on average, are we talking about?. Thanks. I'll definitely do that.. I don‚Äôt know as I don‚Äôt have a pet but based on what I‚Äôve heard from friends, it can be expensive. You should start by doing some research.. Dog tax please? It sounds adorable",481.0,6,72,1
47,Singapore Has Just Been Ranked as World's Best City For Street Food,dkwu41,2019-10-21 07:21:34,notexthere,110,0.91,83.0,"Everyone in SEA will be triggered. [Found the source, and their methodology](, which is:

> The 50 cities were selected after reviewing numerous ‚Äúbest street food cities‚Äù lists and included those cities that appeared more than once. To get a figure for the number of street food vendors in each city CEOWORLD magazine analysed street food data in Google Maps. CEOWORLD magazine used Numbeo to find out the current price of an inexpensive meal in each city. Data from UNICEF was used to rank the cities by food hygiene. **The Street Food City Index 2019 ranks the cities on 4 parameters: number of street food vendors, affordability, number of street food experiences, and food hygiene.**. Lots of debate over the term 'street food' over here, not too surprised.

The modern Singaporean (read: up to 4, 5 decades old counts) no longer considers our day-to-day fare as street-food, because we have grown used to seeing hawker centres and food court as their own establishments. This isn't the case for foreigners who are used to brick and mortar style of restaurants, diners, cafes, etc. 

The common definition for street food would be 'food not eaten in an actual eating setting', but for Singaporeans (and Malaysians, Hong Kongers, etc) who are already used to the idea of hawker centres/communal stall areas we think 'street food' to mean 'food bought off roadside stalls'. Of course, to many people (or at least, the ones that consider this list to be true) that is only a subset of street food. 

Pretty amusing, because the Singaporean food scene has outgrew that street food label for decades now. Reasons why we made it up that far on the list, aside from the definition of street food, is probably because

* food is ez to find, small city means that good food is easily found and reviewed on social media. Meanwhile even in popular tourist destinations like Bangkok, only a select few 'stalls' are popular enough to have proper following. But in Singapore, you get newspaper articles, crop-outs of web reviews, etc pasted on most stalls that are worth a damn. And even the stalls without such glamz can also serve good food.

* relatively cheap, especially for tourists (assuming they are not getting ripped off at Lau Pa Sat for $8 hokkien mee lol).

* Hygiene due to actually not being on the street sides. Massive difference compared to Vietnam where it's common to eat on tables that reaches lower than your knee. This is probably one of the biggest reasons why Singaporeans don't consider our local food to be street food, because we are so used to eating them with proper table and seating.. Taiwan : Am I a joke to you?. the ranking is based on number, affordability and hygiene and searched through google maps, and not how nice the food actually is. so ya, if u take kopitiams as street food, den we are the best no surprises there.. >Worlds Most Sanitized Cities for White Tourists and Business Travelers to Have Street Food and Pretend to Experience a Life-Changing Cultural Experience

That top 20 list.. Taiwan's street food is much better than Singapore's. TIL hawker centers serve street food. Laugh in Vietnamese. M'sian [kpkb]( liao.. we have the safest,cleanest and some say tastiest hawker fare in the world, but street food please go to M'sia, Thailand, Vietnam, et al.. Huh we have street food???. til wee nam kee and yakun is street food. sg so rich, street got aircon wor. Street food? What street food? Oh, those permanent carts in air conditioned malls can pass off as street food one, ah?

Oh. Okay lo.. my neighbourhood is quantity over quality, 3 day old cai png everywhere. wow ...

kaya toast as street food

just wow.... Other Cities Include Bangkok,Tokyo Honolulu and Durban. Here we go again.. Penang: Am I a joke to you?. I honestly feel embarrassed for them, cos its quite obvious their editors and writers know nothing about street food if they think Singapore is the best.. Should be Thailand though.. Number 3 is Hong Kong? How does Hong Kong have great street food? Do cha can tings count as Street food now?. Just like what the Mat from Malaysia will say ""BUTO AH!!!"". Based on hygiene, yes. But taste wise, our neighbour up north so much better IMO. Taiwan‚Äôs street food is the best for me.. [deleted]. Street food are food on the streets ? Chicken rice counted meh ?. Dubai is ranked 11th while Malaysia doesn't even crack Top 50. Street food at Dubai, think about that.. We have street food? Even without the hygiene criteria, Singapore should not be so high up in the list. I wonder if the judges know the meaning of street food.. Err.. No. No way.. including Singaporeans. Our food scene is good but it's not a street food scene. The examples they named are laughable. The guy who came up with that list is trying to start a war here to split ASEAN. Peace amongst worlds! üëΩ. especially the cucks at r/malaysia lol. Did they evaluate by how clean the streets are and how you can eat off it?

Or did they just visit a Pasar Malam and decided we won?!. food hygiene probably knocked Bangkok and a few other cities off the top.. In Google Maps wtf. Who finds street food on Google Maps.. That answers it. Singapore is beaten by many other countries in only one category. For example, in terms of taste or food experience as they call it, maybe Bangkok is like 90, or Malaysia 80 while Singapore is 60. But hygiene, the others languish around 20 while sg would be close to perfect. And then there are two other less important parameters. So that explains how sg comes out on top, but the taste and experience as a whole, not as much.. They added in the ninja vans, cart ice cream sellers, Pasar malams I guess?! Not forgetting the void deck otah and epok people.... the parameters didn‚Äôt include actually having the food on the street?. Recently just finish watching ""Ugly Delicious"" on Netflix. Dave talk a lot about how reviews are totally bias because people don't just critic base on food but also the ambiance. There's even in some episodes he asked the owners that the food is good but how does it cater to white people. I feel like after watching the series I can understand why they pick Singapore to be number 1. Almost similar to your reasoning.. Well to some people as long as it's not sold in a restaurant but on the streets or markets then it's street food. Back when I was a kid, wait don't even think I can call myself a kid at that age, more like a toddler coz I was like 2 maybe 3 years old when that happen

The hawker centre stalls of today all sold their food on the streets. I know this coz my family were street hawkers until they were forced to move into Hawker Centre. Yes I am old

So while our definition of Street Food is different vs other Southeast Asian nations, its still Street Food

Also reason why Malaysian taking offence to SG trying to get our Hawker Culture into UNESCO is really stupid. Our local hawker culture is pretty unique and quite different from Malaysian Street Food culture. Their definition of street food seems different from what we'd expect in Singapore.

I've worked in Sydney and can't even think of any street food that's known there.. Is pasar malam considered street food?. Here I was pondering if my definition of street food was backward and myopic.

Edit: reading my comment again, may seem like I'm taking a jab at the above poster. Actually just sharing the same sentiments.. The funny thing is that most here seem to be critical of the methodology used to determine the ranking.. Luckily my neighborhood is the opposite. Got 4 Michelin bib and a few Michelin Plate stalls within 15min walk from my place. Username checks out. Maybe the kopitiams by the roadside also can be considered.. There are a couple of explanations. For one thing, they might put the 4 parameters as equal,  but when it comes to food, taste should have higher weightage.

Hygiene parameter will always favour sg. So we look at the others. Affordability, they might consider purchasing power, so sg is pretty strong there. Then come accessibility. This one is arguable now. Perhaps sg scored high here because they count hawker centres and kopitiam which are available almost everywhere. While other countries, for example Malaysia, some of their best loklok are carts that isnt exactly registered, so these kind of food places might be omitted.. There's one thing that SG street food has got going for it, though - it's probably safer than a lot of other places' street food. :/. You see. No one care how good you are till you know how to sell it. Singapore is the best in selling itself.. I'll say it. Our food scene sucks. When you get hired hands to cook your noodles stall at a ntuc foodfare, and they use a timer to cook your noodles.

No.

Even your basic kopitiam or food court needs good food.

Can we compare to Bangkok? No. We should lose. Any random corner shop I walk into will have better standards than sg.. Malaysian subreddit cares less about us than you think. Yep. And probably affordability if we compare our earning power against other SEA countries.. to be fair, they are at #2, probably because they made up for it at every other category.

But apparently Singapore is high enough in 'number of street food experiences' to be #1. Talk about subjectivity.. Curious how Singapore ""street food"" is synonymous with food hygiene, but big SG caterers are trying to ice everyone who cares to order from them.. I love me some plastic bottle goreng pisang. Very crunchy.. Only in Singapore because they are all registered businesses. 

Anywhere else in Asia, unless the store is so popular, you will never find it on Google Maps because it‚Äôs probably illegal, doesn‚Äôt have an address and is set up literally on a random corner.. Hahaha, I've been trying to rationalise their criteria's, but this explains it all. In singapore, everything is about hype. Open a new stall, get influencers and people to review them on Google. Sell carrot cakes, but this time rename it to carrot cubes and put bacon, create social media awareness and there you'll find Google reviews. 

The real Malaysian orang asli seafood restaurant can't even be found on the map. I doubt many good ones in other countries can either.. Actually I think the Malaysians are angry because their food generally tastes nicer.

Sure it's also more unhealthy and less hygienic.. That applies only to the first generation of hawkers, very few which are still in operation. Anyway it was a dig at how they classify street food, not at your post.. Lol, want to make hawker culture a Singapore heritage, but when the word street food come up, it's ours too!!. To me, yes. My definition of street food is a makeshift stall that can have either a permanent or temporary location.. To me street food is food you are meant to eat standing up/walking about. So yes.. Safe. Sanitised. Secure. Soulless.

Practically the Singaporean mantra lol.. This... Like Gardens by the Bay. Huge overpromise.. What's wrong with using a timer?. What's wrong with using a timer if it gets the job done and done well?. oh really? I've chanced upon their sub a couple of times and they appear to have an unhealthy obsession with us.. Probably because all of the criteria's are considered equal. If the best of taste is 100, Singapore probably will get ~60 points. That's not that far off, losing just by 30+ points. But when it comes to hygiene, sg will probably best the others by 60-70 points giving them the lead they need.. A lot of Thai street food is on Google Maps. The problem is it moves around or closes and then you go looking and can't find anything to eat.. No need to be angry tho. The fact of the matter is, many Singaporeans go into Malaysia for their street food, but I have never seen Malaysians come into Singapore just to eat hawker food.. Selfish as well. Nothing. Unfortunately what you get here is not food that is done well. Just food that is done *consistently*.. it's a convenient national directive to use each other as scapegoats whenever it fits la, c'mon. i love M'sia and its peoples ok!  When you go there you enjoy cheap and tasty food, friendly folk and a relaxed yet familiar atmosphere thats nostalgic and warm. Then you come back here and thank whatever imaginary friend you believe in that you dont have to commute there daily.. Because 3:1? Not all msians have the spending power.. I'm not angry?. The two are not mutually exclusive. Food can be done well AND consistently.. But the food prices aren't 3:1 are they? Dollar to dollar, Malaysian food is alot more expensive, whilst still cheaper, it definitely isn't 3:1.

How about this. Have you ever heard a Malaysian go into Singapore and say, damnnn, I MUST have that bak kut teh at Changi...it's one a kind.. It's not the case here though.. Not really 3:1 but for e.g. a wanton mee I had in JB costs RM6. Can you find $2 wanton mee here? You get my point. The FX favours Singaporeans.",2257.0,12,1,1
48,Falling cohort size prompts NTU to review funding for programmes,dkwq30,2019-10-21 07:09:44,notexthere,27,0.89,18.0,"? It‚Äôs not like there are a shortage of students who apply to NTU but get rejected. Sounds more like an excuse to cut funding.. Lan jiao la. So many eyebrows were raised by the staff this school year because the intake was so huge; there were noticeably more students everywhere. Just look at the lunchtime crowds in ntu. Gongjiaoway... >Undergraduate enrolment at NTU has been relatively stable over the past decade, ranging from 23,481 in the 2010/11 academic year to a high of 24,312 in the 2016/17 academic year, before tapering off to 23,891 in the latest intake.

It's ridiculous that they are cutting funding due to this. MOE decides the intake for every course. This, the ""falling cohort size"" isn't due to the declining birth rate. It's probably due to MOE reducing the intake in anticipation of economic slowdown. Or perhaps too many professors/lecturers left NTU recently so they had to reduce the intake.. Oh well the humanities and social sciences always gets the finger when it comes to funding. lol please, we all know that they fucked up building their new building *The Arc* and overspent, so fundings for other things are decreasing and they increase costs on the students via fees. Last i heard in Aug, some people haven‚Äôt even been paid by NTU since April.. Why is a lot of the focus on that one school. The choice to cut that school shows NTU‚Äôs priorities.. > # Falling cohort size prompts NTU to review funding for programmes 

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî A shrinking cohort size due to declining birth rates ‚Äî which has already hit secondary schools and junior colleges here ‚Äî has prompted the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to review and make changes to how it allocates its financial resources.¬†

> TODAY has learnt that some modules and overseas programmes at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) ‚Äî which is under the umbrella of the university‚Äôs College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (CoHASS) ‚Äî have been scaled back, with the message of fiscal discipline and prudence being emphasised at a recent regular town hall with CoHASS faculty members.¬†

> CoHASS consists of WKWSCI, the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM), the School of Social Sciences (SSS), and the School of Humanities (SoH).¬†

> Some faculty members from WKWSCI, SSS and SoH also told TODAY that funding for them to attend conferences has been cut, and they have been encouraged to use their own research grants to attend conferences.¬†

> However, unlike the undergraduates from WKWSCI, students from ADM, SSS and SoH interviewed by TODAY said none of their programmes or modules have been affected.¬†

> Responding to TODAY‚Äôs queries, an NTU spokesman stressed that the university‚Äôs financial position is sound. Nevertheless, changes were ‚Äúmade in financial allocations to optimise resources, so as to ensure the changing needs of students and other university stakeholders continue to be met‚Äù.¬†¬†

> ‚ÄúA falling cohort size in the coming years due to declining birth rates, which impacts all universities in Singapore, also means fewer students to spread out fixed costs. The University therefore needs to be strategic and prudent in its allocation of resources to ensure financial sustainability.‚Äù the spokesman said.¬†¬†

> The spokesman noted that the university‚Äôs leadership ‚Äúregularly has town hall sessions to share with the faculty and staff the University‚Äôs new developments, future directions and major initiatives‚Äù . He added that fiscal discipline and accountability ‚Äúare emphasised at all levels‚Äù, given that the university receives a significant amount of public funding.¬†

> Undergraduate enrolment at NTU has been relatively stable over the past decade, ranging from 23,481 in the 2010/11 academic year to a high of 24,312 in the 2016/17 academic year, before tapering off to 23,891 in the latest intake.

> However, the trend of declining enrolment has hit lower educational institutes ‚Äî 14 primary schools, 22 secondary schools and eight junior colleges have undergone merging exercises since 2016, with the Ministry of Education (MOE) citing dwindling birth rates and shrinking cohort sizes as the main reasons behind the moves.¬†

> An MOE spokesperson said the ministry provides operating grants to publicly-funded Autonomous Universities (AUs), including NTU, to meet their operational needs. ‚ÄúThe grant is provided on a per student basis. The AUs have the autonomy to decide on the internal allocation of the operating grants provided by MOE,‚Äù the ministry spokesperson added.¬†

> Speaking to TODAY, four CoHASS professors said that during the college‚Äôs town hall earlier this year, they were told by their dean that the university is watching its finances in the coming years. All of them spoke to TODAY on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media on this issue.¬†

> When contacted, CoHASS dean Joseph Liow told TODAY that he had spoken to the faculty members about ‚Äúfinancial issues and part of the strategy of the university is to be more disciplined in the use of resources‚Äù.¬†

> He added: ‚ÄúSingapore is facing demographic challenges and the pool of students is getting smaller. Enrolment is a major source of revenue, so we need to calculate this as well.‚Äù

> These financial issues have had an impact on faculty. One faculty member said that previously, her department was able to hire at least five part-time tutors but now it can only hire two. ""It means a lot of pressure on full-time faculty,"" she said.

> The NTU spokesman nevertheless said the number of employees remains stable and it ‚Äúcontinues to exercise prudence in hiring‚Äù.¬†

> ‚ÄúThe university continues to hire staff and faculty at a pace that ensures organisational renewal and responsiveness to strategic areas of need, so that our workforce is equipped with the skills required to sustain and support the growth of a world-class university,‚Äù the spokesman added.'¬†

> Among the modules and programmes at WKWSCI which students and faculty members say have been affected are:¬†

> The Engage Communication Conference which had been held in the past three years to give students insights into the media industry. According to student organisers, there will be no such conference this year.¬†

> A practicum module offered by WKWSCI, which involves students producing the 25-year-old campus newspaper The Nanyang Chronicle. The module was no longer offered this semester, after the newspaper stopped its print run amid plans to go fully digital.¬†¬†

> The Overseas Film Festival Practicum module which is not offered this semester. Checks on the university‚Äôs website showed that it was offered in the corresponding semester in 2017 and 2018.¬†¬†

> When asked about the affected modules and programmes, the NTU spokesman stressed that none of the programmes were cancelled. They have ‚Äúeither been redesigned to adapt to a changing media landscape, or expanded to cater to more groups of people‚Äù, said the spokesman.

> Asked to elaborate, the spokesman said that for example, the school now offers eight overseas learning programmes ‚Äî instead of just four previously ‚Äî and it is ‚Äúalternating these programmes annually so that it can continue to serve the same number of students as before, while providing meaningful experiential learning opportunities to cater to a broader range of student interests‚Äù.

> TODAY understands that there were no formal announcements or emails notifying students about the changes to the affected modules and programmes. Students would find out on their own when applying for their modules during the start of the semester or referring to the course list during registration.¬†

> Nevertheless, a notice was put up earlier this month on the Nanyang Chronicle website stating that it will launch an online version in August next year in response to ‚Äúa new media landscape and how audiences consume news‚Äù.¬†

> In the meantime, it will publish ‚Äúa few articles‚Äù written by first-year students from the Basic Media Writing course and edited by a faculty member.

> Several WKWSCI students who worked on The Nanyang Chronicle last semester said that towards the end of the semester in May, the lecturer-in-charge told them that the campus newspaper could go fully digital because of budget issues.¬†

> When contacted by TODAY, the lecturer, who has since left NTU, declined comment.¬†

> Ms Nicole Fong, 22, a third-year student from WKWSCI, were among those who lamented about the loss of hands-on experience which would have been provided by a stint with The Nanyang Chronicle, for example. She added that the university could also have better communicated to the students about the changes to the affected modules and programmes.

> The NTU spokesman reiterated that it is ‚Äúcommon for organisations, including universities like NTU, to regularly review their programmes and make changes to ensure that they remain relevant‚Äù.¬†

> The changes in financial allocations ‚Äúwill enable the University to continue offering quality programmes and an optimal environment for education and research‚Äù, the spokesman added.¬†

> In the meantime, the university ‚Äúcontinues to invest in initiatives to improve organisational capabilities‚Äù to keep abreast of skills and technology required for Industry 4.0. ‚ÄúFor example, a new leadership programme was launched last week. These moves will enable NTU to be responsive to changes in the global landscape,‚Äù the spokesman said.

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( Shrinking cohort size? Definitely not the computer science course. humanities students are the untouchables of ntu. Yeah, totally agreed, if anything, they need to shrink the A-Level cohort instead of university intake. If they're not academically strong enough to meet the university cut-off then they should be guided into poly or other institutions beforehand.

There's also no shortage of foreign students willing to study here. If they need revenue, they could easily take a leaf out of Australia's book and accept more of them.. We limit the top 3 university to top 20% of the cohort. There's no point lowering the bar and accepting random Tom dick and Harry.. the new timber NBS building as well (Academic Building South) that is being built over the old Innovation Centre at SS :-). Accepting more foreign students would be a PR problem for NTU, especially when higher-ups told undergrads that foreign intake is being decreased.. As a poly grad, it was quite sad seeing that some local unis establish higher academic requirements for Polytechnics than A-level grads. That, to me, doesn‚Äôt make sense. It became so common for people to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think A-level is suitable for me but it is easier to get into uni so just do it‚Äù.

But anyway, after I left Singapore to study overseas, I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt study locally. If only people realise that university rankings are based on research output, not academic quality.. idk why NBS needs a new building lol expanding SPMS would have made more sense, can put more machines etc but then again they got no money lol. If it was a private organisation then it might be a problem, but it's NTU. They can just accept all the foreigners anyway, and sit tight while the PR shitshow runs its course. Locals are not going to refrain from applying.. Yeah, I totally agree with you, I had to study uni overseas because I did too badly in my As, and I feel like it was a blessing in disguise. Not just in terms of academics, but also in terms of being in a different country and getting exposed to the culture there.

And I know people who managed to get 3.2 or 3.4 GPAs in poly but have to go to SIM because the NUS/NTU cutoff is stupidly high.. *looks at the population white paper, CECA and other long-lived foreigner complaints* perhaps. I suppose if NTU didn't care about perception of foreign students, they wouldn't be letting prospective students and their parents know that foreign intake is shrinking.",1926.0,10,1,1

> Ngu was engaged by a client in 2016 to source for a home in the price range of S$900,000.

> In March 2017, Ngu and his client viewed a condominium unit in the eastern part of Singapore priced at S$1.04 million. After the viewing, Ngu told the seller's agent that his client was keen on the property and asked about the commission payable to him.

> The seller's agent informed Ngu that his client was willing to sell the property at S$1.02 million, and to pay Ngu a commission of 1 per cent, which was about S$10,000.

> But Ngu said he wanted a commission of 2.5 to 3 per cent, and did not tell his client about the seller's offer. Instead, he told his client the property was valued at S$1.18 million on average and suggested an offer of S$1.06 million.

> However, his client's own checks with a bank showed that the estimated value of the property was S$950,000 to S$1 million.

> Without his client's instructions, Ngu told the seller's agent that his client was willing to purchase the property at S$1.04 million, with a commission of 4 per cent to be paid by the seller and shared between both agents. Ngu asked for 3 per cent commission for himself, which was about S$30,000.

> Ngu advised his client against buying the condominium unit, citing the high price, despite the actual reason being his failure to negotiate for himself a 3 per cent commission, CEA said.

> CLIENT SUFFERED LOSS OF S$20,000 TO S$30,000

> CEA said Ngu's ""wrongful conduct"" caused his client to suffer a loss of between S$20,000 and S$30,000 in the transaction.

> Ngu pleaded guilty to three charges under the CEA Code of Ethics and Professional Client Care ‚Äì failing to convey the seller‚Äôs offer of S$1.02 million to his client; failing to declare in writing his conflict of interest in getting a co-broke commission; and failing to convey to his client the seller's counter-offer of S$1.01 million, with his commission to be paid by his client.

> Five other charges were taken into consideration.

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( i dealt with him b4 omg.. Can we contact the seller/buyer directly? Is property agent a must?. I thought the norm is 1% to 2% commission paid by seller to be shared by both sides' agents. Asking for 3% is overkill.. Even after his suspension ended his career prob over lol. First thing that came to my mind when the title wrote 'unprofessional unethical conduct' was that he tried to pull something  out of pornhub.. Buyer and seller must communicate (exchange contacts with one another). Don't let the middleman do ghost. 

Always the middleman want to close the deal ASAP they don't give a FUCK about your situation if any.

note: middleman = agent. This is what you call a stupid agent, should be grateful can even make the sale, lying for that extra 10000 cost him his whole career. This is one of the industries that SHOULD be disrupted with technology advancement/Digitization. Info is still not very accurate and hope HDB sell/buy portal can start triggering the industry transition.. IPassion only got fined 15k for pasting fake safety mark stickers on its chargers? Does not make sense.. use block chain to do the bidding.. Up you go!. Yes

(Source: bought from property agents). And that is intended from the perspective of a seller. However, there is often no goal congruence between buyers and their agents.. Not easy to fool buyers now because all the past transaction data for your block is available online. Maybe if your reno damn swee you can justify selling at higher price.. Ok anot?. You can, but if you signed an agreement with them beforehand they can still legally claim commission from you if you do try to bypass them.. Yes you can.. He was probably trying to see if someone were dumb enough to pay him 3%.. Nothing wrong if they want to close the deal asap.

But in this case, the agent was trying something funny which resulted in the deal falling apart.. Yes. This. There are alr applications for this purpose. Middleman services like property agents are going to be redundant soon, in the absence of any reactive regulatory protection.

Rn, we need property agents mainly cos of the many paperwork involved, some of which have statutory requirements to be effective. But Blockchain and smart contracts have the potential to do away with these concerns. Buyers and sellers can deal with each other in a more seamless manner. When that day comes, I reckon property and insurance agents will be in danger of obsolescence.. rental only, wasnt great. got into a disputr with landlord. on hindsight might be due to him.

Props to these volunteers, personally I don't think I'll be able to do that!. Imagine for $50k you not only have to stay in there but also catch and eat one of the roaches.. Hoarding is usually a symptom for mental illness. So treating the mental illness itself should be the solution you're looking for. Roaches really stink when you burn them.

Dead one anyhow cincai fry and add some oyster sauce, I'll do it. in the new DSM hoarding is likely to be listed as a mental disorder in its own right. **joe mama**. I will run and dive into the nearest swimming pool.. There was one time I forgot to tape the chute during fumigation....

51,Student Exchange in Shanghai,dkwj0m,2019-10-21 06:47:59,"The thing is I got an offer to study in Shanghai University of Finance and Economic for a semester and I have to decide soon if I want to accept it. This wasnt really my first choice as I was looking to go to Europe for exchange hence am abit hesitant.

I will be there from Jan to May 2021.

Im looking for advice on whether I should accept it and how it's like living/studying in China. Anyone spent some time there before? Would greatly appreciate any tips

My lessons will be taught in English so language barrier wise wouldnt be too bad",1,0.5,18.0,"A lot of things in Shanghai are actually, for lack of a better word, Singaporeanised. Breadtalk exists there for one thing, and there are actually foodcourts that serve ""Singaporean"" food. You should be spoilt for choice in terms of food. Just be careful in the more touristy areas, as the prices can be exorbitant, even more expensive than Singapore.

Infrastructure wise, it is not bad. Just be careful about lugging large suitcases around, as a lot of their subways don't have escalators to the surfaces (this was about 3-4 years ago, things might have changed).

If accommodation is provided, living expenses shouldn't be too expensive, as rental is quite high in Shanghai (if you want to be comfortable). You can bring expenses further down even more if you are willing to self-cook at home. Eating out at Cafes and such in Shanghai can add to the bills significantly.

Besides the requisite selfie location at the Shanghai skyline (at night), you can also check out some of their more exotic locations like the [Shanghai InterContinental Wonderland]( It's a bonkers wonder of construction.

On the tech side, there are two things you will want to prepare for in advance. Data and VPN. If you have a phone that has two slots for SIMcards, it will be much easier. Get a China Simcard for local calls and data. You will need VPN to access Google, GoogleMaps, GMail, YouTube, Reddit, etc... I personally use ExpressVPN, but so long as it is reliable, any VPN will do.. Go for it!!! Any overseas exchange is a good exchange!. You'll have fun and your misconceptions about China will mostly be dispelled.

I've lived here for close to 6 years and feel that there's lots that you can learn as a student living here for 6 months.. do get a reliable vpn service on ur phone and laptop. fb, whatsapp, reddit etc are blocked. also just in case vpn service down, ask your family members and close friends to get wechat accounts as a back-up to reach out to you. 

also high speed rails are quite convenient. making weekend trips to other major cities around can be easy and affordable.  Places like Suzhou, Nanjing are nice to visit and trains to those two cities from Shanghai would take about 30mins and 75mins respectively.. Shanghai is a great city. We do try to travel and go out of our comfort zone to experience something different. Either way, do well and enjoy your stay. There'll always be good takeaways no matter where the wind blows. Experience is the best teacher in life.. Expensive.... Accommodation isnt provided so I was thinking of gathering a couple of friends and renting an apartment for a semester. Another possible way is probably school dorms but Im leaning towards an apartment

I understand that China uses WePay alot. Do you have any idea if I can use WEPay there without a China bank account.. Thats nice! Hopefully my misconceptions are not true. Yeap will probably explore different cities in China and hopefully get to climb the Great Wall. Yea going exchange is about getting out of my comfort zone. Just currently unsure if studying in China is my thing. You'll need a Chinese bank account (should be able to set up one with your passport as your ID) and a Chinese phone number (from your SIMcard).. ADD\] You'll need to inform the bank teller that you intend to use the account for online use.. It's called WeChat Pay, and no you need a Chinese bank account IN CHINA, overseas Chinese bank account doesn't count.. There are reasons behind why people prefer this over than and stuff. Maybe it's a good idea to list down first why studying in China isn't on top of your list and what makes Europe your thing.

If the reasons outweigh your priorities as an exchange student then you have to think about it. Otherwise, better be clear on what we really want. After all, this might (or might not be) a blessing in disguise.. Will I be able to do this in Singapore or can I only do this when I reach China?. Ah that makes sense! Will think about it the next few days. Thanks!. 
You can only apply for China bank in China.
Your university you're going to will probably have a bank located in the university and will help with the process of opening an account. 
If not you could always just open a bank account at any China bank once u reach. 
My friend tried linking her ICBC she opened in SG but was unsuccessful. U can though deposit money into ICBC and withdraw it in China without any further bank processing fees..

Screaming ""AHTC"" is the new Chewbacca defense for arguing against opposition logic points.. Pritam is awesome. Love the guy. I think everyone knows that opposition held wards have lower priority when it comes to upgrading works and the like. LKY himself justified this practice years ago during the 2011 election when he insinuated that opp voters will live and repent. Also, Mah Bow Tan during the 2001 election said this about Lift Upgrading Programmes:"" *That is why... the Government has given priority to those who have actively supported these programmes* "" and "" *It's only fair that we give those constituencies that have given us support, higher priority..* ""

It took them 8 years in 2009 to finally push Opp wards like Hougang and Potong Pasir for lift upgrades.

Anecdotally, it is an open secret that opp wards have lower priority for revitalisation works. As much as this guy can explain, that is how everyone feels. I am just disappointed that he didn't take this chance to prove Pritam wrong by releasing some stats to show that upgrading works are no longer politicised. Instead, he launched a predicted and irrelevant remark about the AHTC saga. Like wtf? Completely dishonourable.. even a fool can see something is up when something like a wheelchair ramp takes 7 YEARS to build.

it's not the bloody Causeway ffs why need 7 years?!. I wonder how Potong Pasir residents felt after they became PAP and the area suddenly transfromed from 10 years behind other estates to becoming much more modernised. I mean... it used to have no NTUC for crying out loud.

[8 years ago]( So after losing the general elections, PAP candidates may move on to... another governing body in the same GRC? 

That's nonsense. Then have elections for what?. Will this be reported on ST or CNA online?. > # PAP grassroots adviser says no ‚Äòdouble standards‚Äô, Workers‚Äô Party chief Pritam Singh rebuts him in 3 hours

> The People‚Äôs Action Party‚Äôs (PAP) grassroots adviser for the Eunos ward wrote a lengthy reply on Saturday, Oct. 19, responding to Workers‚Äô Party chief Pritam Singh.

> Advertisement

> This was after Pritam wrote on Oct. 15 where he publicly questioned if a barrier-free access ramp in his Eunos estate took a relatively long time of seven years to complete because it was mooted by the opposition party.

> The PAP grassroots adviser, Chua Eng Leong, denied that this was the case, calling what Pritam wrote as ‚Äúunsubstantiated comments‚Äù, and criticised him for making ‚Äúpolitically divisive and factually inaccurate comments‚Äù.

> Chua was part of the losing PAP team that ran in Aljunied GRC against WP during the 2015 General Election.

> Pritam did not mention Chua by name in his initial post.

> Advertisement

> Chua rejects Pritam‚Äôs insinuations

> Chua said that Pritam‚Äôs allegation of a deliberate delay in the completion of the ramp was ‚Äúunjustifiable‚Äù.

> This was so as a proposal for the project was similarly mooted by Eunos Citizens‚Äô Consultative Committee (CCC).

> PAP candidates who lose in the general election become part of the CCC so as to remain as a key decision-maker in the constituency.

> Referring to the ramp, Chua wrote: ‚ÄúConsidering this was proposed by Eunos CCC, why would Eunos CCC delay the project?‚Äù

> The Eunos CCC and the People‚Äôs Association ‚Äúwould ensure the seamless completion of the project once the necessary approvals have been granted‚Äù, Chua further explained.

> Funding for the ramp, Chua elaborated, was secured in September 2016.

> Construction for the ramp started in December 2018.

> Advertisement

> The People‚Äôs Association on Tuesday handed over the ramp at Block 108 Bedok Reservoir Road to the WP-run AHTC.

> Seeking to explain why the ramp took so long to be completed, Chua said the contractors in charge of the projects had asked for ‚Äúextensions of time‚Äù.

> This response by Chua appeared to be addressing the question by Pritam about why a ramp took years to complete, instead of just months, when the project was first mooted way back in 2012.

> Chua said his response necessary

> Chua wrote that he had ‚Äúchosen to respond only so as to maintain a level of accountability to our residents and my fellow Singaporeans‚Äù.

> He also suggested that Pritam was leveraging the situation for political ends.

> ‚ÄúIt is politically mischievous to suggest that proposals by MPs are commonly ignored,‚Äù Chua wrote.

> ‚ÄúIn fact, Mr Singh had acknowledged in 2015 that 17 of AHTC‚Äôs proposed projects were accepted. Every proposal, whether from MPs or from the CCCs, must be scrutinised and prioritised carefully, with accountability in how we justify and award such contracts.‚Äù

> Chua said that ‚Äúregardless of whether it is the People‚Äôs Association, the CCCs or the opposition MPs‚Äù, fellow Singaporeans‚Äô interests will be served.

> Advertisement

> Referred to ongoing AHTC court case

> Chua also took a dig at Pritam in his post by referring to the High Court findings on the AHTC case.

> Calling the issue a ‚Äúred herring‚Äù, Chua pointed out the need for accountability by those found to be in breach of their fiduciary duties.

> Pritam Singh responded promptly

> Within three hours of Chua‚Äôs reply, Pritam responded via another Facebook post.

> He said he was ‚Äúdelighted to see the CCC finally engage this issue, albeit only after things have to go public‚Äù, especially after ‚Äúrepeated emails, requests for answers have gone unanswered and ignored, over many years‚Äù.

> Pritam also called this issue ‚Äúa systemic problem‚Äù, and not a personal one targeted at grassroots advisers.

> He wrote: ‚ÄúAs far as possible, I have sought to avoid naming the relevant Grassroots Advisers in person because this is not a personal issue.‚Äù

> Responding to Chua‚Äôs reply, in greater detail for some specific points, Pritam questioned if the ‚Äúseven-year wait for a proposal to come to fruition‚Äù is the norm in PAP wards.

> Highlighting an omission in Chua‚Äôs reply, which appeared to contain information that was previously not revealed before, Pritam wrote: ‚ÄúIf funding was already secured in 2016‚Ä¶ I cannot find a substantive reason for the delay in Mr Chua‚Äôs long post.‚Äù

> Pritam emphasised the curious issue of securing funding by further highlighting that the Ministry of National Development has been disbursing some S$40 million annually for estates to be spruced up.

> Advertisement

> Disclosure of financial numbers

> The opposition party chief also called for greater disclosure of numbers, even as he agrees with Chua that every proposal submitted to the Community Improvement Project Committee (CIPC) ‚Äúmust be scrutinised and prioritised‚Äù.

> Pritam called on Chua to ‚Äúshare some numbers so the public can understand‚Äù how much funds were allocated to the Aljunied CCCs after the WP took over the running of Aljunied GRC, in comparison with the average for CCCs in all other constituencies.

> ‚ÄúIf the difference is stark, maybe the Aljunied CCCs would raise their hands and acknowledge the elephant in the room?‚Äù he said.

> He added: ‚ÄúMr Chua contends that the (ramp) is a red herring. He is wrong. It is a metaphor ‚Äî a very powerful metaphor for the double standards when it comes to CIPC funding in opposition wards.‚Äù

> Pritam responds to reference to AHTC court case

> In response to Chua bringing up the AHTC court case, Pritam said he ‚Äúfully expected some reference in any reply to my original post to the ongoing court case‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúAs the matter remains before the courts, I am sure the public can understand why I will not be commenting on it,‚Äù Pritam said about the trial that is moving on to a second stage where the court will assess the quantum of compensation that the town councils are entitled to from the defendants.

> Pritam ended his response with a proposal.

> He mooted the idea for the Aljunied and Hougang CCCs, as well as the elected opposition MPs in the ward to ‚Äúsit down together to develop a protocol on how CIPC proposals should be handled in opposition wards so as to ensure equity in disbursement of taxpayer dollars and efficient execution of CIPC projects‚Äù.

> He said: ‚ÄúI will be happy to be a part of the solution.‚Äù

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( All Mothership did was to take their posts and change parts of it to reported speech, and the rest remains in quotes. Idiotic if PAP thinks they can pull this stunt. Even more idiotic if they think they can deny it and not incur anger.. Everything is politicised. The PA and TCs are staffed by PAP members or people loyal to the PAP. This was intended to keep a stranglehold on the political landscape so that even if the PAP do not form the government, they can still obstruct the hell out of their opponents. Then they point out how poorly managed the opposition wards are and then use it to get elected again. 

An opposition government will find out they won't be able to get anything done. Things like building a ramp will take a decade and their wards will see their infrastructure decline and lag behind the more frequently upgraded PAP wards.. He got the aura of a mp even when he isnt one the fat one. cockroach looking to score points with its master to be a promotion candidate. That‚Äôs why he can open his mouth without any fear of consequences or reprisal.. Yeah. The guy must be a fool if he did not expect Pritam to be prepared for any mention of AHTC. When the facts are not in your favour... kinda reminds me of that tv programme when CSJ implored Lawrence whathisname to not sling mud and focus on the issues at hand. Then Lawrence proceeds to fling the poo.. I'll just leave this here: 

# The political economy of public housing upgrading programs

*This paper provides new evidence on how the incumbent parties use public service provision as a political tool, and assesses the economic consequences of the political business cycle in Singapore.* 

[\_The\_political\_economy\_of\_public\_housing\_upgrading\_programs]( No singpost is crazy. As bad as singpost is.. Now it has 2 NTUCs within like 200m of one another!!!. This is old news really. Even [PM Lee admitted as much 8 years ago](

>	Paraphrasing the question posed, PM Lee said that what Mr Seah meant is why the opposition wards are not treated at least as good, or maybe even better than the PAP wards.

>	PM Lee added, ‚Äú**And the answer is that there has to be a distinction. Because the PAP wards supported the Government and the policies which delivered these good things.**‚Äù

>	""Between the people who voted and supported the programme and the government, and the people who didn't, I think **if we went and put yours before the PAP constituencies, it would be an injustice**,"" PM Lee told the 1,200 students at the forum.

Thought it was bullshit 8 years ago, still think it‚Äôs bullshit now. The government of Singapore should be working to benefit ALL Singaporeans, not just the people who voted for them.. Yeah n some idiot dared to rob the sing post there  what audacity. For fun lor, hasnt the presidental election shown you just how they could just move goal post until they win?. Magic 8 ball says no. Well it‚Äôs always better than not covering it at all.. Well it's highly unlikely people will be subscribed to updates from Pritam on FB (I'm not lol) so this kind of reporting is fine.. Isn't that the point of reporting news?. They‚Äôve been pulling it, defending it, with people accepting it.. My reaction every time during election that PAP say they don't want gutter politics then they pull this shit. Paul Lampard need to pull strings for his family members, all that points will benefit him in the long run.. lol the imagery is hilarious. By that logic taxation should work differently in PAP wards and non-PAP wards.. Inb4 u/Zukiff's justifications about said practice. Five dollar says they will mention Chua's reply and ignore's Pritam.. >Five dollar says they will mention Chua's reply and ignore's Pritam.

Ok I'll take you up on the bet.

If I'm rich, Dominos. Pepperonis and Spizza are more expensive but leagues above pizza hut and domino's. Pizza Hut‚Äôs stuffed crust always gets me weak.

Unpopular opinion: Pineapple goes onto my pizza.. Dominos for their personal pan offer and 11pm closing time.

Ceasars for their $7.99 full-sized pizza. 

Pezzo is actually quite tasty but compared to the first 2, pricey.... Little caesars. So greasy, so cheap. Dominoes. i like domino's classified chicken thin crust. Canadian's pizza. Cheap but good. How about Rite pizza guys? They do thin crust and the normal doughy ones. The pizzas are really tasty. This is coming from someone who has had his fair share of Canadian pizzas.. The pizza situation in Singapore is pathetic.. Dominoes - bundle deals are good. Alt Pizza if they deliver to you.. Dominos and Sarpino, they aren't stingy with their pizza sauce and their base isn't that thick.. Domino's Pizza. Pepperoni. Its awesome.

Blue label has 2 stores now so its a chain.. Default: Dominos. It‚Äôs the best, piping hot pizza you can get on a budget. 

There‚Äôs a Pizza Express near me. Expensive yet the pizza always arrives cold, no idea why.

Hoping to try Zazz Pizza soon. (Not a chain though). I like pezzo. Pezzo. Definitely one of the better pizza chains out there, although it is pricier. They have the best crust imo.

On a lower price level, I'd have to say Sarpino's.. Try Cibo Italiano in River Valley, wood fired style pizza and not too expensive.. Sarpinos!. Dominos when there is a promo or coupons. As a Canadian who loves pizza, I was horrified when I first ordered Canadian Pizza. 
Now after a long time living here I understand that I will never get pizza like back home unless I bake it myself.

Domino's is acceptable, as is Sarpinos.

I miss Pizza73 wings and pizza.. (Canadian chain)

Trivia for you. Did you know Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada.. Canadian Pizza!!

2
FOR
1!!


Canadian Pizza!!

2
FOR
1!!. I used to say Rocky's Pizza, but they seem to be out of business now.

Sarpino's is a decent option as well, or Pizza Hut if you're more into the crust.. I miss Milano tho, anyway is pizza express a chain?
They are becoming my favorite. Funny thing, i tried to order pizza in the morning and pizza hut didn't allow delivery at that time. But dominoes came to the rescue. 

My vote has to go to dominoes here.
Side note: I like their lava cake. That's all.. Dominos. 2 for 22 and 3 for 33..is pretty good. Order online and you get some nice free stuff next time ) but dont delay tho..the free stuffs expires quite quick ) plus they give their late coupons (like 65% of the time).

Heard Pizza Hut bringing back their Unlimited Pizza. So that might be worth checking out... Used to work at Domino's, classified chicken is the best pizza for money due to its damn delicious sauce.(the sauce is cheesy garlic I think). Not a pizza chain but Collin's pizza is legit mans. Spizza. Join their mailing list. Every so often they offer about $40 for 2 pizzas, which is good for \~4 average eaters.. Pizza Hut cos of cheese crust yesshhhhhh. Pizza Hut or sometimes cold storage frozen pizza. unpopular opinion but it's pizza hut for me! also love their spicy drumlets haha. Whatever happened to Milano's Pizza at Holland Village? Used to go there a long time ago and their pizzas were delicious.. [deleted]. You should try taking away the onions and replacing it with extra cheese. Bomb. This.

Also, Dominos if I have coupons leftover from them.. Isn't the dominoes 2 for 22 cheaper than 241 in canadian?. Dominos with coupon can be pretty cheap. $7 for a regular pizza which is better than mcdonalds.. Peperonis ftw.. we could've been friends.... Now you're just somebody that I used to know.. Care to share on the 11pm closing time deal? Cant seem to find it on their promo page. Holy crap, thanks for sharing.. Agreed. Highly, highly recommend Zazz! Believe they even do delivery (I've never tried that service though, so I can only vouch for the quality of the food when you eat-in). Damn thicc dough/crust thou. That's an interesting fact, on that note it's a shame that we don't have the other iconic Canadian dish in Singapore. Poutine, there's probably an opening for somebody who wants to bring it to our market. My grandma used to get rocky's whenever my parents were out. they used to have a store 10 min walk away from my house but now they're gone :C. Sheng shiong sells their frozen drumlets! Some NTUCs too.. Always expecting low quality pizza eyy. Sorry mate this ain‚Äôt Friendster.. Oops sorry it‚Äôs not a deal. They just open late enough to still order when I‚Äôm out late.. Awesome. Will have to make a trip there, their FB photos always look so tempting.. That's the best part!. There are some places that do sell Poutine. None do it well.
Actually a few years ago a friend of mine who has a poutine chain in Canada asked me to open one here. I crunched the numbers, and to do it right would have been to expensive.. Yeah, they used to have a place at Sunset Way off of Clementi, then they moved to the Pasarbella at Turf City (?).  That whole place turned into a ghost town real quick, though, and I guess they just cut their losses.. ooh never knew! haha thankss. What would be the main expense in doing so ?. Seem like most of the ingredients and labour would be cheaper here than in Canada.. where?. Cheese curds are not readily available, and would need to be imported, or made on-site. The potatoes are way more $ here as you need the North American variety, not local potatoes to do proper fries. And then of course rent, even for a small little stall.

Then if you want to do gourmet poutine costs dramatically increase. And I am not sure how many locals will be willing to pay $12-20 for a plate of fries.. Cook & Brew probably had the best now that Triple O's have pulled out of Singapore. But it is expensive.
The Beast has some pretty good ones with a Southern twist, also pricey.

TAP Craft beer has some very basic ones, they don't excite me much, but ok for a snack with beer.

Canopy in Bishan Park may have them, they used to be on the menu, but I haven't been there in a couple years. The head chef was Canadian. They were made to appeal to locals though, and I never really liked them.. Oh, those calculations make sense, a shame I guess. I imagine Canada faces the same problems with authentic Asian food though",1130.0,3,13,1
55,Anyone regretted not studying hard enough?,dkvcyy,2019-10-21 04:42:51,"Why have not studied hard enough in the past? Is it because you mixed with the wrong company like matreps, video game addiction or you are just plain lazy?

How are you coming to terms with your live now? Also, have you ever felt that you have let your parents down?",239,0.94,134.0,"Am a poly dropout here. Didn't study as hard as I should. Trying to enter poly next year. Do I regret? Initially hell yea, but I told myself if I were to keep dwelling in the past, I will never move forward. What I am trying to do in live in the present and look towards the future!. A small tip.

The best time to study was long ago.

The next best time is now.

Instead of regretting what you could have done before. Start doing what you should have done now. Your future self will thank you.. Definitely regret alot, as a secondary school 3 drop out trying to get back into studying is really hard. Most school require you to either get a completed O level or you need to be at least 30year old and 10years of working experience. I am 26 now with anxiety issues, blank out after army to treat my GAD & SAD. Missing out 2+ years of work experience and private institute still wants you to do full time O's level instead of letting me appeal for bridging or foundation despite having 7+ year of experience since age 15. The struggles only gotten harder when you realise you're not any younger. And everywhere require you a certificate.. No, I studied too hard and vomited. Triggered long term migraine and depression. So I can say I did study to the point of body failure. Got straight A in A level but so what, had to dropout in uni coz of my health. Studying is overrated, learning high income skills, that's far more vital.. I regret not working hard enough in poly to secure myself a place in one of the govt unis. I played video games in class, skipped class towards the end of my third year of poly  and generally didn't bother with some of the mods. Its biting me now and I still feel the regret.

I'm not doing badly by any means but sometimes I wonder if my career would be any different if I at least managed to sneak into one of NTU/SMU/NUS.. I studied hard enough (topped my class every time) and nothing good happened.

People who had failed in their school classes (my current and ex colleagues) are earning more than me.

**Everything depends on how good you can sell yourself.**. I regret studying too hard.. and not spending time pursuing other interest.... there will always be regrets in our lives because everyone has the same 24 hours. Whatever you didn't do, means that there are a whole lot of possibilities that will never happen because you didn't do that very thing.

i noticed a comment here saying how they regret studying so hard because they feel isolated from the lack of friendships now, so the real question is what do you really value in your life? Making your parents proud? living a fulfilling life (and by extension what is your idea of a fulfilling life)? etc.

there was an askreddit thread quite recently about the late Anthony Bourdain, i highly recommend having a read:


if you studied hard, or you didn't study hard, we're all not that different; there will always be a part of us that wants the easy way out (whether it be studying, or getting fit, or progressing in our careers), we gotta train ourselves to go against those instant gratification inclinations so that at the end of the day, we can go to bed without much anxiety instead of ""fk i should have done that thing instead of ____"".

whoever is letting their regrets prevent them from living their lives, i hope you can find peace within yourself so that you can let go of the past and start working towards your future.. Currently 31 Years Old with an ""N"" Level Cert, thinking back I do have some regrets.

When i was in sec 1 I had the chance to get promoted to Normal Acad, but I turned down the chance because I wanted to stay with my friends.

After I got my ""N"" Levels, I enrolled for Chemical Processing in ITE and during my time, it was considered a very good course, but I dropped out of ITE because of the same stupid reason last time, i wasn't in the same class as my gang of friends.

After Dropping out from ITE, I went out to work and eventually due to my parents I went for the next intake of ITE again and enrolled for Mechatronics.

Stayed in Mechatronics for 7 months and I hated the course and everything in it, I dropped out again.

After that I was enlisted in Army, two years gone by very fast and i was enjoying it, but near ORD i was dreading as i realized i only have an N level cert.

After NS, i met my now Wife, jumped around different industry to find a job to see what i feel would suit me, eventually I stayed at my current Job in F&B for 10 years now. Currently i have two kids, Son turning 3 & Daughter Turning 1 end of this month.

I can only say this for those of us that didn't study hard.

Don't dwell in the past and just look forward to what you can do, the perception of success is different for everyone, do not let social norms take control of it and if possible just upgrade yourself, you are never too old to start learning. Yes. NT->ITE>Poly>Uni
i‚Äôm 26 and i‚Äôm still in uni :/. ITE, rebel, clubber, worked in retail (was blogging at the same time) someone saw my blog and asked me to worked for him as a reporter in oil & gas (Platts, Argus, Bloomberg and Reuters were my competitors), market wasn't doing well, quickly leaped to Apple, currently a manger at an aviation firm. let your past be your past. shape your future.. I regretted not finding a girlfriend and studying hard together.. I regret studying and not living. Straight A student with scholarship. Bonded for like a few more years. I'm stuck in a cubicle job with a toxic work culture and absolutely horrendous work life balance. Friends of mine who messed around with studies, graduate with horrible GPA are doing much better and don't question life the way I do. Every day I ask myself what the hell I studied for, if this is the life I wanted.. I cannot speak for everyone but I think no matter how well an individual does, he/she will still question whether they could‚Äôve done better. 

For me it could not not studying enough for a certain subject which leads to me not entering a particular course, but you move on and continue working hard with what you have.. Hi, millennial trash here. 

Ever since i was a child, my parents used different methods to push me to study harder for my own good. I came from a not so bad background. I had tuitions, nice teachers in school, etc. I got into the express stream in secondary school, but from there i was addicted to games and i got super lazy. I wont blame the games- my parents warned me. I refused to listen. I went into Higher Nitec (ITE), then enlisted into the army. 

It was hell in army that woke me up. The first night of my BMT in tekong, i called my parents. I told them it was shit inside here, and i miss them even though it has only been half a day.  

Fast forward 2 years later, im furthering my studies in a private school. I do hope it is not too late for me still. 

TLDR: dont blame your surroundings and listen to your elders or you WILL regret it.. Sometimes I regret not putting in enough effort into the things I did in life, like I'm doing really well right now for a Singaporean but I still regret not putting in enough effort at some key moments. But I think mine is more a problem of overcomparison than anything. Some of my friends are really ultra smart and did really well in school but you'll be surprised to hear that they regret not studying hard enough sometimes. I kinda learnt to not dwell too much on the past coz there's always something you wish you could change, but you can't. So like live in the moment kinda thing. I never regret because regret and worry means you suffer twice.. Instead of trying to study hard just for the sake of it. Understand that life is a long term learning process. Always be learning new things on your own and keeping relevant. All the knowledge is online for free now. Learn how to Google. 

Also women don't give a shit which prestigious school you went to. Don't believe your parents' lies of study hard, get a good job, you'll end up with a nice girl BS. You'll just end up on social media for videoing girls in the shower.. Success in life can be defined in various ways and having a good education is just one factor, though a very important one.

A lot also depends on your own expectations of yourself. The important thing is not to beat yourself up too much on things you can't change but move forward today.  

A good life isn't financial success or acclaim from your peers or parents.... Honestly since I am for internship, studying‚Äôs not everything. It‚Äôs the ability to pick up and process orders fast. What you study does not mean you will apply it. I‚Äôve asked the full timers and the most u do apply is 50% of what you‚Äôve learnt. Having bad grades doesn‚Äôt mean anything as well as you willing to learn that is fine. I‚Äôm having a mediocre gpa for poly. I am somehow regretting not studying hard for the past 2 years because now I kinda wana go to a local university. Oh wells , we can only learn from our past and move on. :). Who doesn‚Äôt have regrets? I think it‚Äôs okay to regret a lot of things. You can think you‚Äôre going to change and fail and repeat the cycle many times. You should just put in your best effort, even if you continue failing after that. When you look back, don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúI should have done better‚Äù. Think ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt do my best, but I can start today‚Äù. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important, even if you continue failing even after trying your best. Effort is less noticeable, but ALWAYS more admirable than results to me.. I am a B student all my life. From young, my goal was to enter local university and get a degree. As a year 4 undergraduate now, I think I kinda achieved my goal already. 

Guess my regret now is that I didn't set a higher or a more long term goal for myself. Then again, I feel that I have very broad but shallow interests in things in life so I don't really have a burning passion for anything and it's hard to have any form of long term objectives in life.. No.. Throw your mobile phone away, smash your desktop, cut off all connection to the internet, and your grades will skyrocket. 

Being here on Reddit is symptomatic of time spent unproductively. Get a study plan, a timetable, find friends who mug a lot, get your A's or 4.0 GPA, go to a good course and a scholarship or some shit and worry about enjoying life once you get out of the tutorial village with overleveled weapons (degree) and armour (scholarship). Farm, farm, farm till you buy your items and hit your powerspike.. didn't exactly study until i started failing subjects in sec3 and received news that there was a possibility i could get retained.. so sec3 was my wake up call. i put in my best efforts after that for O's, poly and then private uni so i don't really regret anything, even though i feel that my results are still considered average among my peers.

have a stable full-time job now so i'm not complaining. not earning big bucks at all but i like the simplicity? at least i'm not so stressed up like some of my peers who are earning way more. i did feel i have let my parents down though but it's something totally unrelated to studies/academics. Yes i do. I am extremely mediocre.

8 out of my 10 friends make way more money than i do and i cant help but wonder how differently my life would be if i studied hard and went to a local uni.

I know my self worth shouldnt be based on how much money i earn but i really cant help but feel this way at times.. Your past self does not owe you anything 

Nor you owe your past self anything. 

Goals and priorities were different then, you did what you done due to them. 

Likewise it is unwise to hold back now by the goals and priorities then.

You can build toward your ideal future but you can't expect your future self to buy into it as well.. Not so much studying, but regret not putting time into other areas or skills, such as learning how to network or doing other things that can be put on my portfolio.. Video game addiction and maybe just lazy.

For sure regret not studying harder, I definitely could've done more and been in a better position.

Anyway, I am generally ok and no i don't feel I let my parents down, just myself.. Sure, fucked around in JC, bombed my As; still did well enough on my SATs to get into an overseas uni, NUS and SMU. Fucked around even harder and dropped out of uni.

Got my shit together, went back to school and near topped my course. Got a bunch of certs, picked up programming, aced my GMAT and got into a top college; now I'm in data science. Wish I'd actually worked harder on my math because it always comes back to bite me

I've almost caught up with my peers but it'd have been so much easier to just study hard in the first place. Used to be a PHD(Poly halfway dropout). was very depressed but went NS, picked myself up, matured and now I'm where i need to be. DOesnt't matter if you made mistakes, you can remedy them.. Definitely regretted not studying hard. Not gonna blame it on anyone or anything as it's all on me. I grew up in a poor and unhealthy family background and my childhood was pretty unpleasant, I didn't have access to technology or whatsoever so that partially contributed to my addiction to video games back when I was younger when I was suddenly introduced to it.

Back then, my guardians were very strict and as was in rebellious stage, I did alot of stupid stuffs and made a ton of mistakes along the way. There are nights that I would think about everything that happened in my life and wonder what could've been different if I just tried harder to deal with my problems back then instead of constantly running or diverting away from it. A few years back I was in a pretty dark place and I really hated my entire existence. I find myself a failure and letdown and was constantly negative. 

Fast forward to now I'm doing better, not quite there yet but am still trying to improve. The struggle is constant but I remind myself daily that I have to tough it out for my future and my dad in hopes that one day I'll make it and we'll have a better life. If there's one thing that I could advise the younger generation, it'll be to study hard, we live in a country that's not linient to people that doesn't have a certificate. It's a sad truth.. For me, it‚Äôs not really the studying but gaining more understanding of the topics I was studying and remembering the knowledge acquired.

I spent a lot of time just memorizing to regurgitate during exams. Feels like I never really grasped the concepts well. 

Forgotten a lot of what I‚Äôm supposed to know. :/. Straight As for O Levels. Played too much, got distracted and didn't study hard enough.. Became straight Cs for A levels. 

Do I regret?  Many years down, watching friends becoming doctors, lawyers and buying condos.. Of course there is that sense of regret. But I got on with a private accounting degree, became a chartered accountant, and have a decent job now. 

Point is - don't look back and don't blame anyone/anything else. Think of how to better improve yourself!. So I retained a year in secondary school for being too hooked to video games and the Internet in general, and generally having a lousy rebellious period. 

Couldn't handle a break up near A levels and got triple C. Couldn't make it in AU despite my best efforts. 

Went to SIM-UOL. 

Finished a masters in SMU. 

So do I regret? Kinda. Many folks tell me I have unfulfilled potential which kinda sucks. 

But i would not be as driven if it was just a straight path and a bed of roses.

Edit: and I am trying to get into a PhD programme now because I want to teach.. I'm sure those perverts who didnt get let off easily regretted it....... I‚Äôm 22, was a normal tech student, went to ITE (NITEC) and missed to enter poly by 0.2 GPA, had to get to HIGHER NITEC to get into poly, now I‚Äôm 2nd year in a reputable poly and in a course than I want. Do I regret? Yes and No. Yes because I could have finished my education earlier, and lift the burden for my parents. No because I would not have met so many awesome friends. Some consider me a success story, other consider me a failure. It‚Äôs all about perspective. It was not easy doing engineering maths with only N level NT maths. But the struggle was worth it IMO. 

Don‚Äôt look back, it‚Äôs not worth your time.. Insufficient information pre-internet era and lack educational guidance post O levels.

Did decently with an L1R5 of 16 in O levels but totally no idea what to do after that. Turned to my parents and teachers/councilors and they can't give a straight answer as well. Went to JC, hated it, dropped out and went to Poly. In Poly studied Business Administration and got a diploma as recommended by my parents and its basically useless for me. Ended up working in IT sector and learning to code now.

You internet kids are way luckier than people like me. You'd get to post question on Reddit and get hundreds of people's opinion on which direction to chose, libraries worth of information with a tap on your phone which are up to date and basically work off a larger database of knowledge instead of relying on trial and error.. Yeah... But what to do, look forward and not back.. I blame super famicon : ). all of the above, but the only way I've come to terms with myself by not blaming anyone else, not to lose anymore time and face forward.. Literally thought about this last night. 3rd year in poly and am regretting not studying harder and am afraid of not being able to enter uni and having a rough time finding a job in the future.. Nope our pm said ite does not stand for it's the end. Yes, totally. Was addicted to Dota ever since 5.33 or some shit. 


Am 1 to 2 years slower academically as compared to someone my age. 


I decided to play catch up by studying part time while doing full time job. My schedule is super tight and regretted not getting a good enough result when I was younger and now I'm ""paying"" for it.. Yes I let my whole family down. I was pretty much a disappointment to be exact. But I don't regret it although my parents tell me to work in a office or something.

I thought hard about where would I be if I didn't let fear and anxiety get to me. But I was proud of me just making a living and studying about people's personalities and life ‚ù§Ô∏è. It's never too late to start again. Especially when you go out to work and realise you don't like working in jobs related to what you studied.. Always.. Definitely felt that I could have prepared better for some exams but the reason I didn't was cause of anxiety and I don't think I could have changed much of that :(. Not really. I didn't have good grades in pri and sec school. Studied really hard in ITE from Nitec to higher Nitec so I can get to poly and get a diploma. Managed to get in and continued studying but couldn't get good grades once I'm in poly. To think that my maximum effort is everyone's else average effort or no effort is depressing.

Now my GPA is too low to enter uni and it's not even nowhere near the average GPA which is 3, hell I'm not even near 2. Nowadays I don't bother being so competitive by comparing stuff and achievements and set things at my own pace.. didn't study hard enough, barely made into uni. now i'm struggling with uni, (probably because im only in my first sem) but there's so many smart students. 

i'm always thinking of dropping out. (even worse because i did not do well for my midterms)

letting my parents down? of course, always. my parents think im addicted to gaming when in reality i try to have a balance of both (gaming helps me to reduce my stress)

sometimes i feel like studying hard, sometimes i ask myself why am i tryharding.. But didn't study hard enough, but somehow still make more money than most scholars in the company. I think having financial literacy, common sense and being street smart  is more important than good score in school.. I was from NA stream in sec sch. Got addicted into gaming around my N and O levels. Did well for N but got 20 pointer for O levels. Went to poly and still continued gaming. GPA tanked hard during my 2nd year and had to do or die during my 3rd year. Luckily i was able to secure a spot in a govt uni and now i am taking my degree after completed ns.. Maybe something to make ppl feel better. 

No matter how hard you study, you will always find even a bunch of smarter people above you. No matter hard you study, it‚Äôs like impossible to overtake then cause they are multiple steps ahead of you. And it‚Äôs just true lol.

So moral of story, find something that you excel in and work there. Then you can truly become the best.. Poly dropout. Yes and no. I was in a course I had no interest in because my O level results were not good enough

Went for early enlistment, took private Dip and Degree.

I'm earning >70% of my age group(>80% for all age group according to salary.com) not a lot but I think I'm doing well enough in life considering I took way longer vs my peers to get to where I am.  


Just dont give up.. I never regretted not studying hard enough, I absolutely hated studying but I felt like I did what I could and had to, no more no less. Yes, I was a video game addict in my teens (actually still am now) but who could honestly say they prefer studying over video gaming or whatever their hobbies are?

Well, I'm still here now. And yes, in the past I felt like I let my parents down, but that guilt doesn't do anything except infuse more negativity. I no longer feel that anymore.. I've been asked several times. My answer is always No. Because I don't believe in staying stuck at where I was. I know I'm not stupid, just lazy af. I always think to myself, I'd not be where I am now if I took a different route. But well, I might end up at a better place if I did. Who knows? 

Anyway, after completing my Nitec, I was given an admission to get into NYP (media design student with a decent portfolio) but chose not to as it wasn't what I'm keen in. Worked part time until I went into NS. Went into the workforce after ORD. 

Joined Appco for 2 years. I'd say I kind of regretted staying for so long even though it helped me in acquiring some life skills and thickened my skin. But well, ""things happen for a reason"" I thought to myself.

Worked other menial jobs, then landed in an MNC as an account manager (sales), quit because it's mundnae. Went back into SMEs and landed in several menial jobs again before landing into a well-paying training consultant job with an SME. Looking back, I had been job hopping quite a bit. 

Anyhoots, I decided to take up a private Diploma in marketing from Kaplan (not a promotion), due to flexibility and interest while working as a consultant at that point of time, I'm taking home a gross of $3k-8k a month as it's a sales job. Pretty decent if you ask me. 

Met my partner along the way while doing some freelance job, recruiting and training roadshow part-timers. Met the future MIL and then due to some pushing, ended up taking up a BA in International Marketing. It was tough but managed to pull through. 

I've just completed it a couple of months ago and waiting for my graduation in 2020. 

Looking back at these...did I regret? Nope, not at all. I'm happy where I am.

 Now I'm taking up insurance courses and browsing for a Diploma in organisational development.. I have always regretted not studying hard enough. I was always almost there. 

Almost passed all my subjects for O‚Äôs.
Almost got into my dream course, Vet Tech.
Almost had a 3-point GPA (a 3 pointer is high by my standards lol) 

Only good thing is I managed to wake up during my last sem in Poly and pulled my gpa up by a little. I wonder if I actually passed all my subjects in O‚Äôs, what would I be doing now?. I used to.

I wanted to get into a good autonomous school in express, just like many others. But I ended up getting a score slightly below 200. I could still go to express, just not in that school I wanted. 

Initially, I was so upset. I beat myself up for not studying hard enough. In the end, I did get into that school, just in Normal Academic. I eventually made it into poly where I am now through PFP (poly foundation programme).

Bad results, while they may seem like it, aren't ever the end of the world.. I regret many things.

Not working hard enough is one of it. Biggest bloody waste of time. So much time wasted, so much stuff I could have done instead. Ah well.. I didn't fit the system. Or the system didn't fit me. Sometimes I wonder if I would be more successful if I was born in Australia.. Didn't study in secondary school, got mediocre grades. Principal told me he could write me a recommendation letter to go to a good JC, take a very specific route towards architecture, but I refused it, took a course in poly I thought was easy.

I'm quite happy with my current job, but the money my peers from back then are making... much much better. Not sure what I was thinking back then ah.. As someone who managed a large regional office in Singapore I had a really hard time hiring people and it was **not** because of education or book smarts.

Most of the locals I interviewed just couldn't think out of the box or be creative with problems.

Not saying that you shouldn't focus on studying and getting a good education, but there's something to be said about real world work experience too.. For sec school, definitely. First half was way too absorbed/engrossed in playing Sims 3 (LOLOL) and didn‚Äôt put in the effort I should have. Went into hyperdrive for sec 3 and 4 and got L1R5 raw 12.

By the time I entered JC, I was way too burned out and couldn‚Äôt really keep up. To be fair, my tutors couldn‚Äôt really teach either so I had problems understanding, and approaching other tutors wasn‚Äôt an option since they were far more popular and had almost zero consultation slots that I wasn‚Äôt in class for. I almost dropped out and went to poly, but I didn‚Äôt know what I could do with myself with a diploma and (despite the bad grades) still wanted to shoot for medicine, which back then went exactly an option in poly. At the time, I believe it was 1 or 2 people who were accepted into med from poly. The burn out caused me chronic, debilitating migraines which ate up JC 2 for me when combined with back issues. Did terrible for A levels, wondered what to do with my life. Did a year of accounting at a local uni but absolutely hated it (no flair for math).

Took a gap year to figure out what I wanna do with myself, volunteered at hospitals as well. Went for an alternative path in Australia to enter med, and by then the burnout ceased so I was able to do very well and get in. Currently finishing up first year med and in SWOTVAC (study week) for exams next week, and doing pretty well. I don‚Äôt think 12 year old me would‚Äôve anticipated this considering how dumb I‚Äôve felt all my life and how my JC Chem head basically said I‚Äôll never amount to anything and that I should drop out and go to poly while I still can.

I regret not studying consistently in sec school, but at the same time I regret not taking enough breaks after sec 4 just because I was paranoid about the transition to JC and kept refreshing O level content during the holiday break and never gave my mind a chance to rest and pushed it into exhaustion.. just plain lazy. I just cruised and never cultivated a good work ethic... now I realize I'm not close to achieving my full potential but it's hard to make up for lost time. I regret but I'm still too lazy to work harder.. No. I dont regret because life isnt a race. Yes, I was a video game addict in my youth and one can dwell on the 'wasted' time playing CS, dota, Starcraft, etc but I think the time you enjoy wasting, isnt wasted time at all. 

Everyone runs their own race in life at their own pace. So what if you are just starting a degree at 30 because of 'wasted' time during your 20s? Or havent quite figured it out what you wanna do in life at 50? Just chill, take it easy..... i dont regret not studying hard enough; what i regret is not learning about how money really works (i.e. finances, accounting, taxes, investing), and taking on reasonable, calculated risks earlier in life (i.e. investing, business, cultivating skillsets).

doing everything i can learn and do with the abovementioned. 

no, in fact, they're holding me back because they still hold on to outdated values of success.. I didn‚Äôt study hard in my poly days cos I‚Äôve no interest in it but continued cos I didn‚Äôt want to drop out or join another course. Tho I did regret not appealing to get a better course at that time. However during NS I‚Äôve been thinking a lot on whether should I continue engineering or move to another course, and during that time I found interest in computer science, especially coding and cyber security. So I made the jump and took on a private degree in computer science and I studied hard for it, and my parents are actually proud that I made that choice. i cant unify gravity with the standard model, fml. [deleted]. Best response here. Poly dropout here as well. That's a VERY good mindset to have. Too many people are burdened by their past, and their present and future are compromised as a result. Keep it up!. Same boat as you. All the best for your poly application next year! I'll be trying to get in as well.. It‚Äôs nice to hear that I‚Äôm not going through this alone :). Same boat as you pal just finished serving my NS applied for poly this year and heading back to poly next year. yeah no point of regretting, doesn't get you anywhre. this philosophy might help to get yourself back on track:

hope is not a strategy

luck is not a factor

fear is not an option. So what are you now ? Earning big bucks ?. That's a big tip, and a very important one. You regret when you're not where you want to be, so instead of dwelling on how you got here, ask yourself how you're going to get where you want.

Then, in the words of muh boy Shia, 'DO IT'.. hope you‚Äôre feeling better, hang in there!. What are those high income skills sia, I also wanna learn. whoa shag.. Hang in there and I hope you are doing better. I kept throwing up during my uni exams also and I already had anxiety so that was not a fun combination.. currently in the same boat but im year 2 sem 2 right now with horrible gpa that wont be good even if i secured 4.0s for my next 2 sems. So lost and confused about what to do right now haha.. the only difference is if you want to work in sg civil service, cos i think those are the places that look closely at whether your degree is from those unis (plus whether it's FCHonours or something).

Other than the above, I can't think of any tangible advantage to studying at those unis. There are likely other ways to sell yourself and get your foot into the job/company you want.. This is true. From my classmates that have high or low grades, all the ones who have higher income now are the ones that are more sociable. Social recluse or quiet types are struggling and one of them have yet to find a permanent job 1 and 1/2 year after ORD.. Don't need to frame it as a mutually exclusive thing tho! If you do both (ie study hard and top your class AND are charismatic/have good people skills) I'd say that's a winning combo.. Hi my name is Imran. This. It pretty much ruined my social life. I regret not spending enough time with my friends. Now I feel left out and alone.. Exactly, there's no point regretting, every other action you take, whereever it seems negative to you, or to your society,  or hell, if it is seems good to you, or society, will mean you will be missing on some kind of opportunity anyways.. Respect! For making it so far and for continuing to strive.. Hey fellow ITE to Uni buddy. But I just dropped out of uni recently. It was just too hard for me. Glad to see another survivor still pushing! All the best!. Heya fellow NT climber. Good luck in uni! I tried to get to uni but my GPA is too low and I no longer have any interest in the course I was in for a private uni. Good to see another one fighting the good fight! All the best in uni and afterwards!. Im in the same boat at you. Heya fellow NT student. I went to took O levels twice after N levels before poly and now Uni. Currently year 3, one more year to go. How about you?. Graduated from ITE, tried getting into mass comms in tp but got rejected twice :( 

Really wished I'm in your route, jiayou!!. sounds more like luck was on your side... Not too late... you could find one now. ""Stop Comparing Your Behind-The-Scenes With Everyone's Highlight Reel"". You sound depressed. You ok bro? Wanna go siam diu later?. I can't regret my life, I'm the best model example of a student with straight Cs who made straight A overnight.

My biggest regret is getting tied down, and can't pursue medical profession.. Because teachers and parents told us that we can make more money if we get straight As instead of straight As gives us more career options.. leave your job and find another place/field. While you are young (< 35 or 38), you can find new stuff.. What kind of job?. Typical scholar ivory tower. Why take the bond then?. positive army story, upvote!

(with additional points for self-deprecating humour). at least you‚Äôre not the last in your friend group, which i am. First time I am hearing someone describe a poly as 'reputable'. You can say SP or NP. I am on this very same train right now.. interesting. what's your company selling?. [deleted]. Palpatine: Dewit. I heard Imran is teaching them. I don't know what advice to give you since I never really compensated my falling behind in poly. But what is your diploma about? From what I know if you build your portfolio, you can still actually try for local unis. I have a friend that didn't even have a 3.4 GPA but entered local uni because of his portfolio. But that was years ago. Idk if things have changed.

All the best though!. I was in the same boat too. I don‚Äôt know what course you‚Äôre in but you should have an internship coming up right? Do well there and it might open doors for you. Who knows, if you love it there you can even secure a future job (after NS if you‚Äôre a guy). All the best :). Oof year 3 sem 2 here, 2.29 gpa, I feel you.. I have no intention to have a civil service career but I see my fellow peers in SIM private unis taking months to find a semi-decent full time job, while govt uni grads of the same major and same industry get bombarded with job offers with much better pay and benefits. 

After 3-4 years of work experience, I think degrees will matter less but when everyone is on the same level playing field with no experience, those with branded degrees do get an advantage.

There is a difference in where your degree comes from, lets not kid ourselves. Our job market is super competitive.. > Other than the above, I can't think of any tangible advantage to studying at those unis. There are likely other ways to sell yourself and get your foot into the job/company you want.

That's not true. Maybe if you only intend to work at Tan Ah Kow Pte Ltd, yeah then your degree doesn't matter. Big conglomerates with fantastic career progression like P&G, Shell, Visa etc hire straight from local unis. You'll never catch them holding recruitment sessions at SIM.. It's never too late to start. Last year I searched online for DnD groups because I was feeling lonely and ended up going to play at a game shop every week. Then I moved overseas and had to rebuild a social network from scratch. It wasn't easy, but I've found that if you take the initiative to reach out to people, they are usually receptive.. There is no such thing as luck.. It is illegal for me now :(. everybody inside siam diu also straight As.

A wah A wah A wah. He also posted about a month ago that he was studying in UWA in Perth.... Alright. Nice. Good luck to you boy! I hope you will succeed one day. Don‚Äôt think too much. Everything will be fine in the end.. im in marine engineering, and its actually the lack of boats that im worried about.
i opted in for a sailing intern but didnt get in presumably bcs of shit gpa. Have no heart to do shore based job in the future so theres that. rn im just hoping i'd get an average looking gpa so atleast it wouldnt be hard to find jobs later on.. Spot on. Also whilst things even out in 4-5 years generally, those from the local unis have a higher starting base salarywise and I find that it's still difficult catch up. well you can roll the genetic lottery and live your whole life with a silver spoon so there's that. depends...if you're religious I guess...?, maybe you can attribute luck to a higher power shaping your life instead.. Wait üò≥ how did that happen. Thats true. Their higher salary snowballs as well so I bet they end up earning much more than private uni grads on average. False. In lottery there are winners and losers. There is no luck.. Not religious at all.. Yup. Not uncommon to hear of at least 30% or more for starting pay. And then it just snowballs from there. I get so annoyed when my NTU/NUS friends complain about a 3k starting salary when all I could find after grad was 2.6k-2.7k",6889.0,6,50,1
56,What is the future of Singapore/Hawker Cuisine ?,dkvcnt,2019-10-21 04:42:01,"I know there has been much talk about not just our local identity and love based around our local food scene, but it's something that had been talked about how it may be a 'dying trade'

Do you feel that our local food is threatened? I know some people are interested in preserving it, but no doubt, hawker business isn't easy. Couple that with people wanting to adapt it into more unique dishes, some people are skeptical (it's like Italians and their fierce pride for Italian food)

Personally I have no issue with 'modernizing' Singapore food. Singapore food had never been 'original', it was our ancestors would adapted their home flavours to this foreign land. So long as food taste good and its worth the price, I honestly can't give a damn.

And I wouldn't mind foreigners taking over local food stores, if they're willing to preserve the dishes passed down by their hawker masters too. It's hypocritical when we we don't want to continue but Kpkb when we see PRC people cooking our food as though only we are allowed to cook our own food. 

But I really don't like the franchising of food courts under big companies, and I hope they aren't able to just own hawker centers outrightly (I don't think it's likely)

The cashless systems for hawkers really need refining though, if they can roll out a nationwide nfc payment for hawkers, it'll be a big plus for plenty of Singaporeans and tourists alike.",19,0.88,29.0,"Think its gonna be either Food Republic -esque foodcourt chains or tjose franchises like Boon Tong Kee/Song Fa bak kut teh/Crave etc. 

My theory is that for a nation to have a culture of cheap and good street food, there must be a perennial underclass of people poor enough to put in the long hours in shitty condotions for low pay in this trade. As a nation gets richer and if there isnt amyone who are willing to do such ""dirty"" jobs (foreigners or otherwise) such food is gonna disappear and we gonna become like Europe with either self made picnic sadwiches or 40 euro meals at resturants.. There needs to be more support from the government in supporting hawkers, in the form of subsidies and cheaper rentals. Being a hawker is tough, with long hours, little reavenue and all the troubles of managing your own business. It is not seen as glamorous, especially in a country that prioritises material wealth over culture. Therein, there has to be allowances given to hawkers who dare to explore such a career option. 

The evolution of hawker culture has to happen as well. What is the central tenet of hawker culture? Cheap, delicious, comfort foods. Now, if hawker culture were to continue, is there options to bring other food cultures into this setting? That is what Singapore hawkers have to grapple with. A living, evolving culture is important for the culture to be able perpertuate itself. 

Ultimately, it is likely for Singapore's hawker culture to go towards a more standardised affair, with hawker chains and PRC cooks, centralised kitchens to cut down cost. Variances will eventually be cut out as the older generation retires, becoming more and more uniform. Soon, if nothing is done, it will become a facade of what it is, a ""hawker"" culture without heart.. Eat more hawker food instead of gg to big franchised food courts.

Be prepared to pay more. Don‚Äôt run away cos the $3 chicken rice is now $4. Singaporean mentality but that is how our hawker starts to die out. Slog so hard, earn peanuts.. So long as Singaporeans insist on third world prices the hawker culture will continue to decline. If it's genuinely part of our heritage then be prepared to pay for it either through higher prices or some sort of public subsidy to hawkers *and* learn to cook.. The future of our hawker culture seems to be an over emphasis on the promoting of young hawkers. I'm honestly a little sick of seeing these videos about these young people going to be a hawker and being celebrated for it. I've tried food from some of these stores after seeing the hype, and they're honestly just not that good. Most of it is marketing, and featuring one young person who decided to become a hawker, celebrating his/her life. They often say things like they want people to know that young people can also become hawkers yada yada, but I'm not sure when anyone said that young people can't be hawkers.

I've also tried food from youngish hawkers who don't self promote or go on social media. Often, those are much better than the ones who have to take off their clothes to sell carrot cake, for instance.. Personal opinion: the pressure to keep things cheap is what's killing the hawker scene. We all need to pay more, if we really want to keep it alive. It's amazing that, for a  global cosmopolitan developed country, food in Singapore is surprisingly cheap, but it simply can't be sustained. 

Already the older hawkers aren't keen to pass on their business to their children because they feel the work, the hours and the stress are not worth it. Any measures to optimize their business are getting a lot of resistance. Joining a franchise (and getting to the use the support and resources of a bigger company) is roundly criticized by the population as ""selling out"" or ""diluting quality"". Hiring foreigners willing to work for lesser pay is also a target of outrage for reasons ranging from ""they terk err jerbs"" to ""aiyah these PRC cannot cook properly"". The hawker folks are trying to hire people they can afford, and the sad reality is that they can't afford the average Singaporean.

Either the government should lend a crutch (or three) to the industry at large to keep prices reasonable, or the hawkers should collectively raise prices to levels that allow them to keep the boat afloat.. Robo Uncle 2000.. majority of it will be franchised swill like kopitiam and food republic, the next generation of independent hawkers will be new citizens starting up new businesses bring their local food here. Singapore Hawkers, successful ones, must have a chance to grow. Say a good hawker wants to grow to have his own setup (ie own store), can he do so? 

How can a chicken rice hawker move from one stall, to a restaurant like boon tong kee? 

How can the western food hawker, move from that, to something like collins?

If there is a path to a comfortable, successful living, then the hawker trade will not die. Because the young hawker can see a path up, to provide better standards, services etc. 

But I see hurdles

1. High rent of own premises - high cost of failure

2. Labor constraints. 

So, these things stop the hawkers from ever trying to be like BTK or Jumbo. Like the Liao Fan Soya Chicken got a boost because of the michelin star, so he now has a franchise. If previously J was a worthless son who never wanted to inherit that business, I will change my mind already, because sucess, ie Money, matters.

Look at how Keisuke Ramen now has more than 10 stores. Can you get the Singaporean hawkers to somehow become like that?. The future is for hawker food to be sold on the streets since it's now a street food. 
128 circle is guilty.

*Propaganda checks out*. Unsustainable. Il give it another 20 years before it dies out. omg hawker centres are fucking gross.. have u seen how they wash the utensils? they literally dump it into soap water rinse it and then let it dry.. never understood why people want to eat in such gross conditions..  but its ok if you takeaway or they give out plastic utensils... go malaysia eat better la, the food taste nicer somemore. you think hawker life can survive in a hyper efficient country meh?

edit: typical sgeans downvoting me because of my first sentence. Everything we must be better than everyone right?. Need to evolve or die off. Hawker food is rubbish in nutrition. Sure some are damn delicious but these days people have more health awareness. They aren't gonna eat char kway teow or laksa everyday.. Sian, PRC cooks have a different in standard as compared to the old uncles and aunties. I find PRC cooking way more salty.. My pet peeve is its always some young banker/insurance agent/engineer/wealth manager quitting and suddenly food becomes their calling. Its often featured by media for articles on food, but how often do you see the opposite, a hawker deciding that banking is their true calling?   


I have no issue with them switching careers, and if they enjoy it while being financially sustainable, good for them. But it goes into the broader issue that F&B is a fucking tough business. It might give people the impression 'wa I also wanna do' without understanding that you have to do most of the work yourself.. I agree to an extent. But any business these days with no social media presence will inevitably lose out. Hawker stalls are no different.. Everybody want food to be cheap. But cost of supplies, rents, electricity, levies all keep increasing. Yet many fools still have the mentality that hawker increase price because they are ""greedy"".

> Hiring foreigners willing to work for lesser pay

This is one thing that many many Singaporeans misunderstand. Hiring foreign workers requires local quota. You cannot anyhow hire foreignors without local quota. Also you need to pay high levies for the foreign workers. The total cost to hire one foreign worker can cost up to 2k which you might as well hire a local. But no local is willing to commit to working in a hawker as an employee and turnover is extremely high.

> selling out

This is the nost hypocritical thing I hear from many critics. Many of these hypocrites will also be joining the long lines at Hai Di Lao, a china business.. Â∞è„ÄÇÂ¶π„ÄÇ‰Ω†„ÄÇË¶Å„ÄÇÂêÉ„ÄÇÊàë„ÄÇÁöÑ„ÄÇËôæ„ÄÇÈù¢„ÄÇÂêó„ÄÇ. As long as license to selling on street is cheaper than rent, it can actually be a viable solution.. what a child.. You will be suprised how ""clean"" and ""hygienic"" you so called high-end restaurent is.. Yet I always see long queue at mala xiangguo. Their price easily triple that of other hawkers.

Hawker food ex cannot, china food ex no problem.  Some people is really üôÑ. True, the flavors are a lot more China-Chinese. Kinda ironic, it is like our hawker culture is reversing back to when our ancestors are in Fujian or some shit XD. Exactly. FnB is a tough business to maintain due to high supply, operations, and manpower cost. High gross, high expenditure, low profit margin. 

I see many young startups go into FnB industry bcos of the ""everybody needs to eat therefore it is a lucrative business"" mentality. Many business operate a few months before closing down.

Also FnB is under the service sector therefore it is subjected to the ever increasing stricter local quota to hire foreign workers. Let's face it, very very few Singaporeans will want to work fulltime in FnB. Many FnB business have to rely on foreign workers and the ever increasing stricter rules means increasing manpower shortage issues. The problem is MOM consider FnB a similar service like retail, which is very a misguided view. Unless MOM seperate FnB into its own sector like Construction or Shipping, this manpower issue will kill more FnB businesses, especially lower income hawkers.. Of course, you're right. Although the overemphasis on irrelevant factors like online presence or age of the hawker hardly do anything to change the one fundamental aspect of why we go somewhere to eat: the taste. I believe that while Singaporeans are extremely picky about their food, we are also very forgiving. Give us good food, and we are willing to suffer through the consequences of getting that food. Just look at the long, snaking queues for really popular stores. Many of these hawker stores are often located in heartlands, in places that are not air-conditioned. I think that fact alone should already tell you that Singaporeans care more about the taste of the food more than often irrelevant factors like what I've stated above.

Really good food often do not require deliberate social marketing efforts. Word-of-mouth is enough. The social media presence (if required) should come after, not before establishing the quality of the food.

What I feel is that the newer generation of hawkers have it backwards. But that's just my opinion. I'll stick to my comfort food over hyped hawker food any day.. carry on with your dirt and garbage then. Yes. The good social media presence should only be the cherry on top, rather than allowing the food to be overhyped.

I‚Äôve been frequenting AMK these days for my meals because the ‚Äúold school‚Äù hawkers still exist there and they can be located deep into the heartlands. Its slightly inconvenient but hey the food is good.",1917.0,8,244,1
57,How do you improve your speaking skills?,dkuzcf,2019-10-21 04:05:37,"Thinking of either joining Toastmasters or Asiaworks. Any other suggestions?

When I speak, I tend to 'uh' and become nervy, in part due to my quiet nature",19,0.86,14.0,"I am not good at public speaking myself but my caution to you is to [be wary of Asiaworks]( Personally, I improve by giving speeches and talking to new people a lot (clients, but still). Don't know about Asiaworks, though the link that u/mamajumba gave was enough to steer me away from them. 

I've seen Toastmasters at work (one is linked to the volunteer organisation I serve at), and for the most part, their members speak well, share well. So I'm highly inclined to endorse them. 

However, if you like to cut out the ""uh"" ""ummm"" ""like"" "" actually"" ""basically"", I would just suggest to speak slower, perhaps record yourself on camera to find your filler words, and start working on cutting them out. My journey to cut them out has been a long one. I first noticed a lot of filler words when I was younger, on an exchange. Foreigners would say I (we singaporeans) speak too fast, and I would keep practicing my speech until it was slow enough for an international audience. That automatically gave me a lot more time to think, and cut out a lot of filler words.

Feel free to replace the filler words with pauses / silences. You'll probably look smarter / wiser at that. =D 

All the best!. I am unclear what's your definition of speaking well.

To some, being able to speak with a 'slang' even if the speaker has yet to leave the boundaries of Singapore is equated to speaking well. 

Being able to enunciate birTHday instead of birFFFday is enough. 

Catch yourself using too many fillers? Just practice impromptu speeches more. Give yourself a motion and make a 6-8 minute speech. How does a tree grow or something silly like why the sky so high. Practice makes all the difference. 

Nervous energy and shaky hands? Just more practice. It doesn't really go away. Mine transitioned from nervousness to adrenaline, different cause same result! Use forceful gestures and don't let your hands hover. Hold your hands together and pull them against yourself if you feel uncomfortable letting your arms dangle. Learn a repertoire and have one less misery to worry about.

If you're still in an institution of learning, join the debate club instead.. I've been for 2 toastmasters meetings as a guest. They do train people to stop using fillers. So it seems like a good place for practice.. If you‚Äôre talking about improving your English, read more books/listen to podcasts

If you‚Äôre talking about speaking more eloquently, practise and do not be afraid to make mistakes; acknowledge them and improve.. Stop speaking singlish. It may be endearing in the sg context but it confuses and irritates people from abroad.. I‚Äôm an introvert who had to learn to speak and communicate well for my job. Pronunciation is key. We often mispronounce words without realizing how badly we sound. We also speak fast and take short cuts without enunciating properly. For eg, it‚Äôs colleague, not ker-league. Anything with ‚Äúth-‚Äú gets lost in the local accent, it‚Äôs hard to tell the difference between three and tree. It took me a while to undo these bad habits. But it can be done. 

You can check with British Council to see if they offer professional public speaking and elocution lessons (We had a trainer from there during my school days) These days, I have a thesaurus app on my phone and iPad and still double check the audio pronunciation to ensure accuracy. With frequent practice comes confidence. Good luck!. Try meetups. There are a few public speaking/presentation groups there. 

A branding consultant gave me some pretty good advice on public speaking when I had to do a presentation - I was advised to keep rehearsing until I could speak without looking at my slides. And I had to really believe in what I presented, in order to have a naturally enthusiastic tone.

I also went for networking sessions, observed the more confident conversationalists and picked up some tips from them. Basically fake it till you make it!. I also wanna join toast masters! I think it really aids you to speak better.. Practice makes perfect. I used to be super scared of public speaking, cos I am shy and soft spoken by nature. But I guess u cant really avoid presentations in school, and also in church there were ample opportunities for me to speak in front of a room full of people. So I just grit my teeth and do it lor. After a while I got used to it and the nerves wore off. Especially in poly where presentations are common. U just gotta keep practicing. 

One thing I find that helps a lot is to speak from the heart. If I understand what I am saying, it's easier to speak naturally. Better than trying to memorise lines cos u have to do double thinking: think what u need to say, and then think how to say it, cos u need to recall ur lines. But if I speak from the heart, I am very clear on what I want to say and I can focus on how to convey it best. I also apply this to job interviews. None of my speeches/interviews are ever scripted or even planned, I just wing it but if I speak from the heart I know I will do well. Hope this helps

ETA: if u wanna avoid using fillers like ""errmm"" and ""uhh"" and stuff like that, then just...dont say it. A short pause is better than a filler.. Keep two ping pong balls in your mouth at all times (one inside each cheek). They'll help you to articulate your words more clearly. After one year, you can remove them.. I read through it, I will not consider it then. Can put OP's balls in your mouth too since u like to talk cock. wtf lol",976.0,7,26,1
58,Job Portal Concept [Idea Feedback/Possible Implementation if viable]- For those tired of ineffective/non responsive job portals,dkuz2a,2019-10-21 04:04:47,"Good day to everyone, I have an idea I am entertaining which came to mind recently and I would like to put it out there, however, considering the fact that my target audience would initially be solely locals, I would like to get some feedback on it before actually embarking on said project.

Job searching as of today has its own problems and if things were to continue as-is, I believe we will reach a level of saturation with regards to the amount of applicants. This combined with the lack of a standardised system, will ultimately result in lower employment in areas which may actually have a good number of decent applicants.

There is no limit to who my target group is; meaning anyone from part time to full time to managerial roles are covered. (management/c suite roles will definitely require a different hiring approach but that has been taken into consideration and will definitely be given more in depth planning prior to implementation, probably late stage)

*Problems faced by:*

**Applicants**

* Lack of response from job posters/employers (waiting time of more than 1 week on average for most job portals)
* Spam from recruitment agencies (resulting in unclear job scopes that might change during the actual interview/ dissappointment due to unmet salary expectations)
* Unclear/unrealistic job description (e.g 3 years experience, ability to do build, clean and maintain a house -> Entry Level Job)
* No information on company
* Unsure of standards/reliability of company that you are applying for.
* Unable/difficult to track who has gotten back to you/not or when you previously applied for a company (some websites already do this but not all)

**Employers**

* Applicants have to be vetted (manual processes like resume/ basic questions)
* Lack of compatibility with workplace environment \*
* Unmet expectations due to the current standards of job ads (they expect way more because we don't adhere to actual advertised salary counts, we use it more like a baseline for comparison) \*

^(\* previously worked on another solution that I would be able to resolve these issues with)

I am currently drafting an idea to create a portal that would resolve these issues to a major extent, for starters, requiring both employers and applicants to reply to applications within a predefined time frame as well as setting a scoring system that accounts for companies/applicants who are applying/hiring with accordance to good practices.

Please feel free to leave suggestions if you feel there are areas which i missed (definitely have as I haven't done any surveys or anything of the sort thus far). But the main point of this post is to find out; if I built such a site and managed to convince employers/hiring mangements to post jobs, would you use it to find a job? Or do you think that existing sites already serve the purpose?

Open to suggestions/opinions!",11,0.86,12.0,"Another problem faced by applicants is possible racial discrimination during vetting. So a solution is to give all applicant users of the protal a unique ID no and to hide the applicant name, race etc from employers during vetting.. As someone who has built and operated a job portal before, pm me if you have any questions. I'm not going to offer up anything because I feel that it's better if you think of it yourself and not get influenced by other ideas.. But the employer will ultimately meet you first before deciding on the hire right? If they really want to discriminate, they will just do so when they find out. It's just wasting more time for the applicant.. Something I hadn't considered, will be a good implementation i believe! Thanks for the suggestion!. Language proficiency would almost immediately reveal the applicant‚Äôs race.. Will keep your offer in mind, thank you!. Then hide that aspect for jobs that doesn't need proficiency in languages apart from English. To address the concerns both of you have brought up (of which are valid no doubt), I intend to implement a scoring/rating system for employers as well, which is affected by such actions. Rejecting an applicant will require explanations from their end, I will personally look through the explanations for the first few months during the initial phase. Once that is complete it will then be automated using ML.

Proper explanations will result in no change in scoring, avoiding applicants due to unnecessary reasons will result in a score drop. Either ways the goal here is to change the way things are currently done, so this will be mentioned to them prior to getting them on board.

I believe the solution is not to try and quietly prevent them from discriminating but to mention it up front, if they are dead set on not hiring someone will specific qualities which logically have little to no impact on the actual job being done, I would rather they hire on other existing portals. There's no need for me to recreate that problem on this portal.. That can do too. Or make the jobs that require a additional language proficiency a different library of jobs from the normal English-based jobs.. Only certain jobs need non English proficiency, like tour guides. Well there‚Äôs also things like dealing with overseas market, eg company has factories or customers in China and requires you to be able to converse in business chinese etc.. Yea but most jobs only require English proficiency.",419.0,16,462,1
59,Why do people think Singapore is boring?,dkur1r,2019-10-21 03:44:06,"This is the common reason among my friends why they want to move out of Singapore or go overseas to study. They like to say Singapore has nothing to do, there are no interesting people and there are no interesting places to go to. 

Not being overly sentimental, but I think Singapore is fine the way it is. In fact, I love it. There are beautiful sights to catch - sunsets, skylines, nature parks etc. Have you ever tried taking a stroll in the CBD at night? It‚Äôs a very surreal experience to wander on empty streets surrounded by towering frames of glass and steel that are gently illuminated by the orange neon. I don‚Äôt think anyone can get that experience in other countries without being overwhelmed by crowded tourist traps or bright piercing lights that are a real cacophony.

And who says there aren‚Äôt interesting places to go? If one is adventurous enough to explore the more rural roads, you can find those small nuggets that are the SAF‚Äôs bases, like school of ammo in Rifle Range or ST Kinetics building in the middle of the jungle right outside the central catchment area. Gombak used to have a trekking path that cuts into MINDEF‚Äôs small hill (but sadly it closed cuz of erosion).

Also, the geography of the island. Ohhh the geography. The diamond shape is such beautiful geography. One moment you are in bukit batok, the next you are in Clementi after walking about 45 minutes. Walk further and you reach the sea. Walk along the coast and you reach Downtown. It‚Äôs homely with all the neighbourhoods nicely and conveniently situated next to each other. In any other country, there would be no limits to the urban area and sometimes, there is just a town sitting in the middle of vast hinterlands. Singapore is just like a video game map, something out of GTA.

Idk, or am I actually a siaolang?",839,0.92,382.0,"Part of the group that thinks SG is boring, but mainly because my interest lies more in grand nature, like Switzerland's Alps. Singapore just completely lose out to nature found in other countries. Besides that, living anywhere for decades of your life can make it boring.. A 45 min walk in SG is vastly different from a 45 min trek in say NZ. Just the weather in SG will make the walk insufferable. Moreover, if you walk around the heartlands, the sights are more or less the same. BTOs after BTOs.. Singapore is a pretty nice city. It is not perfect though. Its cultural life is somewhat limited in comparison to major Western cities of the same size (lower variety of independent movies, very few musical attractions) and it does not have a spectator sports culture. On the positive side, Singapore is a culinary paradise.. Spent most of my life in Melbourne. Moved to SG 5 years ago. I‚Äôm 37. 

Living and working here in the first few years was great. Since everything is new. 

But 5 years and counting. It‚Äôs getting a little claustrophobic and boring. 

Two reasons for me:

1) no variety in weather
2) can‚Äôt really ‚Äúroad trip‚Äù. End up in JB. haha

Singapore is an amazing city. There is plenty to do and when work is crazy busy, you don‚Äôt have much time to road trip. 

I do find myself bored at times. I can‚Äôt reasonably afford a car either. So even if I wanted to, I couldn‚Äôt get away for a bit. 

The plus side is that SG feels like the middle of the world. So going overseas is definitely easier than being in Melbourne. 

I miss the outdoors. The winter.. A few reasons.


Outside of the CBD the architecture of the endless  HDB blocks is kind of grim and repetitive. I understand it is totally functional and some of the best public housing in the world - it just doesn't look amazing 

Also, apart from a few areas like Kampong Gelam and Chinatown and the street life here is sorely lacking. Even in those areas stalls are heavily regulated. There is a lack of spontenuity on the streets here. The law is so restrictive.

Outside of the centre it's just malls, boring double laned roads with no shop fronts and apartment blocks. Compared to other Asian cities it isnt fast paced and exciting. 

Also the nightlife is boring in my opinion. Overpriced drinks. Outside the centre the bars don't have character and they shut early, forcing you to go to the city center. 

On a positive note Duxton Hill may be the best place for bars in my opinion. I love the atmosphere there. But again that isn't anywhere near where I live meaning I either need to get the MRT at 12 or fork out for a taxi.. As the saying goes, [familiarity breeds contempt]( We know the good **AND** bad of Singapore. Until you actually go out there, you won't really know the truth behind the idealistic views of other countries or their stereotypes.

Now with that said, it is entirely possible that a person will still love another country more than Singapore simply because it matches their personality far better and that is okay. Immigration is a thing after all, and just means that we have things to improve on. Only a fool would say that Singapore is a perfect country.

On the other hand, culture shock is still a thing, just like the traumatised Japanese who visit Paris and need [psychological counselling]( No country, Singapore included, will openly advertise their bad points to the global audience. In most cases, the best way to appreciate Singapore more is to leave her shores for a while and travel overseas on a free and easy basis. **NO TOURS!** Tours give you a distorted and sanitised experience. Free and easy is the way to go, because you get to experience their infrastructure on a first-hand basis, and you get to meet locals who are not directly part of the tourism industry.

\*Disclaimer: Tours may be necessary in certain areas where violence is rampant for your own personal protection. As a rule of thumb, if the hotels have armed guards, Tour Groups may be better. Do your research first.\*

From overseas experience, you will see where Singapore shines in comparison, and where she fails. Staying in Singapore only will give you a very distorted view of where Singapore stands in comparison to the world.. Grass is always green elsewhere. I moved away from my hometown of Amsterdam because it's crazy boring there. I enjoy it here. But for you it might be the other way round. That's part of being a human with curiosity I think. I'm one of those who are contemplating permanent relocation in a few years. Don't get me wrong, I'm Singaporean through and through, and I'm patriotic and appreciate my roots, but I don't think the Singaporean lifestyle is for me after living 6 months abroad.

Singapore is a city, and it's a great city, it's safe, it's clean, pretty much has anything what one can ask for. However it is overpopulated and small, it gives off a very claustrophobic sense. The variety of activities as someone else put it, is pretty ""sterile"". We're aren't exactly the most creative or outgoing or initiative bunch, in my opinion. 

With all these factors considered, my time spent last year in a Swiss town had a lot of positive effects on my mental health. Walking 20 mins to/fro work where I get to look at nature helped me relax before a work day. The seasonal weather was also an excellent respite from the crazy weather patterns of Singapore. The work and social culture is also slower paced and in my opinion, more enjoyable to me and better for my personal mental health.

Of course, no country if perfect, and whatever cities or towns I'm contemplating to move to, perhaps, in the future would have its flaws as well, so it's more of a making a decision on which is a better investment or choice for myself.. That‚Äôs why so many people have hobbies they like to do. 

But crowds

Also high costs 

Then we back to square one

I don‚Äôt wanna pay $20+ to go bouldering in a tiny space and there‚Äôs like 50 people there

It‚Äôs just abit sad that we have to pay a higher price to ‚Äúescape‚Äù from the monotony of life in SG. 

Wish I go just drive and go hiking like people do in California or New Zealand but nope it‚Äôs just a million Uniqlos and a million more tourists. My experience in Singapore as a European is that it's a sterile city. Sure it's beautiful but it's just a lot of the same things, and there is low variety in a lot of things. The Botanical gardens are ok, but they're not natural, and at the end of the day Singapore is just one big city. Also music, film and just living variety in general is very low, and people are quite similar in thinking and their way of behaving.. People have different interests and pursue different lifestyles. Many of which can't be adequately accommodated in Singapore. Quite frankly, a lot of the supposedly interesting perks of Singapore you mentioned sound really underwhelming to me.

Singapore is essentially just a high density, overgrown city packed onto a tiny island. It's the 5th country that I've worked in now and while I'm generally content with life here, I certainly wouldn't want to live here long term or raise my kids here.

I'd like my dog and kids to have a yard and a pool to play in. That's practically a pipe dream in Singapore with the prices of bungalows here. My tiny condo already costs $7,300/month. I don't even want to look at prices of landed properties with the amenities I want.

Shit, there's actually a lot more but I don't want to end up with a long critique of Singapore. 

tldr would be, there's a reason why tourists come to Singapore just for food and shopping and are recommended to stay just a few days as that's all it'll take.. The life in Singapore is highly controlled and static. Many cities, larger and smaller than Singapore, are much more vibrant - there are community initiatives sprouting up, grassroots action, local pop-up markets where locals sell their own crafts or homegrown food, mini festivals. In Singapore, event of any sort tends to have a 'government stamp' across it. These tend to be highly budgeted and organised - printed banners, stallholders with considerable budget etc. So they tend to be more economic and commercial in nature - after all, they have to appeal to the broader segment in order to make their rent.   


By contrast, other cities that are not so strictly controlled tend to:

* Feature more creative work
* Feature causes close to the community's heart (e.g. adopt a dog)
* Be by the community for the community (e.g. organic homegrown produce, homemade pastries, small artisan work)
* Affordable or free (Karaoke for old folks at void decks charge $2 per pop. Mid-autumn Festival entry costs kids money too. I'm not sure about other festivals - seems like the town councils hardly organise them. You'd have to go to the mall to celebrate anything.)

There's very little sense of human relationships and appreciation. That's what ties a person to a place. 

It's like being in a house - it's huge, it offers food and sleep. It has air conditioning. But your family doesn't talk much to you. In the end, if it boils down to mere transactions, how much of a bond can you develop with this house?. One of the best things about summers in most of US and Europe is that the weather doesn't get \_too\_ hot. And even if it does, the air tends to be dry, so you don't feel sticky and gross.

I love doing all the outdoors stuff--hiking, cycling, picnics, festivals, whatever--but it can be genuinely miserable here to spend extended periods outdoors. I don't even fault Singaporeans for being ""basic"" and choosing to hide inside shopping malls and living rooms. The heat and humidity can be so exhausting.. Cut through it all, you will find Singapore living revolves around the same things; searching for good food, shopping, clubbing, movies, etc. I want to find a quiet space surrounded by nature and no one, I cant do that in Singapore. There is always someone around. The air in Singapore smells awful, you only realise that the air in Singapore always has a smell to it when you leave this island and go overseas where there is a country side for you to wake up and smell what fresh air is. 

It is a concrete prison, regardless how glitzy everything is, it is still a prison nonetheless. Perhaps you enjoy a stroll in the CBD at night, but I prefer a stroll in the woods with no one, just the sound of nature with me and fresh air.. I hate to say it, but Singapore is a relatively small country that is driven very much by money. In a very capitalistic country like Singapore, I assume money dictates on whether you can enjoy this or that hobby. Of course, any hobby will cost money even outside of Singapore. However, Singapore requires quite more than it might cost somewhere else. Also, because the working culture quite intense here, it won't be easy to find time to become attached to a hobby. However, it is a great country for some foreigners to come and work to save money as it has a lower tax than most countries. 

But humans are always complaining, so as someone else stated on the comments here, a place is only as boring as the person saying it's boring. It's all about perspectives I guess.. I think the experiences in terms of locals vs. expats will be different as will age groups. Most people on reddit are young.

I'll speak from perspective of an older (38) expat who has lived in 7 countries.

Yes, Singapore is very, very boring. The best thing expats will say about Singapore is that you can travel easily i.e. get the hell out of there on the weekend. Here is my, what will be perceived to be very negative, list of why Singapore is ""boring"" not ""bad"". Again these things aren't exclusive to Singapore but when taken as a whole... things add up:

* One season
* Lack of nature. MacRitchie doesn't count, sorry folks, even HK has much more nature, hiking trails, etc. than Singapore. In fact, HK might be one of the best urban areas in the world for this.
* Cuisine and cuisine experience still doesn't stack up with other big cities. Not even close.
* Too sterile and clean. You can be clean without being sterile, look at Japan, Korea, etc.
* Lack of world events. No big sporting events. I am a huge F1 fan, and the GP is organized quite well, but that's about it... and as far as races go it's one of the most boring on the calendar (it's essentially a parade from a racing perspective). There's also a general lack of infrastructure to support great events. Kallang Stadium is subpar on the world stage.
* The city lacks an ""edge"" or a ""soul"" as some westerners would call it. This probably brings Singapore a lot of tangible benefits as well. But we are discussing fun vs. boring. It's boring.

So this doesn't mean Singapore is bad, but if I were a 20-25 year old looking for my first experience abroad, Singapore would be at the very bottom of my list. Probably the same between 25-30. Now, over 30 is different because your priorities change. Seeking new experiences dies down a bit, and you focus more on close friends/relationships, family, career, etc and Singapore is a great place for these things.. Yeah, until the novelty wears off. Call me a bore but I have done plenty of urban exploring until it felt ‚Äúoverly used‚Äù when I do visit the same place twice with no direction, week after week.

EDIT: Sodium vapor lamps are slowly being replaced with LEDs.. It's because they haven't visited Singapore's wonderful shopping centres and casinos.. I feel it's not about the sights and sounds, but about the things to do.

I like having steak, ribs, and BBQ. These things are expensive in Singapore. If I had a choice, I'd have meat (steak, chicken chop, pork chop, etc) almost every day. I can't do that in Singapore.

The hobbies I want to do, like woodworking, building things, experimenting on stuff like on TKOR are very difficult to do. The laws are very prohibitive, and I don't have the space to do them.

Singapore also doesn't have seasons. I would like to experience things like Winter and Autumn. 

Also, maybe it's just me, and I hope not to offend anyone, but the people are quite boring as well. Everyone thinks the same way, and want to do the same things (travelling, shopping, looking for ""bargains"", etc).

I don't hate Singapore, but I do find that it's very restrictive.. No natural landscapes to explore, hike or in general to find adventures in. No seasons to vary our dressing and daily habits. Overly sanitized nightlife that ends too early. Over-managed and soulless shopping districts with shops that close too early. 

It‚Äôs a great place to raise a family but there‚Äôs no doubt that it pales in comparison to many other cities out there.. Well for me, I‚Äôm intrigued by gothic western architectures and natural landscapes that SG lacks. Most of our sights are sadly... manmade infrastructures. And I‚Äôm a person who loves to explore different cultures, so the opportunity to study and work overseas excites me. Of course it‚Äôs difficult and stuff la... but I don‚Äôt want to just stay in my comfort zone.. Please don't 'wander' into SAF bases/camps/military zones for explorational purposes, you'll end up with complimentary tour of one of our many neighbourhood police stations. It's nice, don't get me wrong, but we don't have something to offer for people who want something different.

Can't be helped because of our geographical area.

For me, I enjoy hiking mountains and rock climbing. The only options in SG are either Bukit timah Hill or rock climbing gyms.

There's something about being in awed by the size of a 1km high mountain, and climbing all the way up, and looking down below.

Oh and when the night sky is dark, and the milky way reveals itself.

It's all up to personal preferences.

And because of our size, there's no real feeling of escapism. Even the most loyal Singaporean friends I have get bored too, but also because unlike other countries, where you go 'fuck I'm tired of X city let me drive to the countryside without leaving the country' its just not possible.

The closest is probably the St John island, anywhere else in SG still reminds you that you're on SG. You can't drive 10km out and go to some national park, the only option really is Malaysia.. It's true that Singapore is lacking in some areas, like nature reserves and scenic places, but that's down to our small size and highly urban environment. Even then it's not completely void, as OP has given some excellent examples. Our small size definitely hampers the amount of activities and the variety of them.

However, to say it's completely boring is also not true. Last weekend I spent time at the National Museum on two different exhibitions, and the week before had a great time at GameStart's board games section. It was no Origin but I still had fun. Last year I attended a living room concert, and let me tell you, listening to a talented singer without amplification is a very moving experience, one that everyone should try to experience if possible.

The thing is that, I had to have exposure for all of the above and grow interest in them  over the course of my life time. The two exhibitions I saw were related to photography and history, and gaming in all forms has been a huge part of my life growing up. Finding out about the local music scene was through a couple of people as acquaintances I met over the course of work.

I think the main issue is that Singaporeans can be very boring themselves. If you have no interests or hobbies beyond watching TV and going shopping, then the above things I mentioned would've sounded boring to you. ""National Museum interesting meh?"", I can hear the complaints already. ""GameStart so small, can compare meh?""

The other thing is that many Singaporeans like their experiences ready-made and packaged for them. Sorry to say, but many of the big events you hear about in other countries grew from small grassroots affairs. If you want something to happen, you have to do your part as well.

The final thing is that I think, like I mentioned in the daily thread, is that we generally like a sense of curiosity and discovery. If we just expect to sit and wait for things to happen, nothing is going to happen. Go out and discover new things, both within and without. Without growth life will be very boring.. It's fine... But you are still trapped in the small city. You cant compare urban exploring to being able to drive to the countryside, being able to go camping next to beautiful streams without dying of sweat and mosquitos.. My two cents as foreigner who lived in Russia, Poland, Germany and US and also visited a decent amount of countries:

tl/dr: it‚Äôs even more boring in most other cities, you just don‚Äôt realize it.

- Even the most exciting city in the world will feel boring if you live there your whole life.

- Singapore, based on my experience, has plenty of things to do compared to most cities out there, big or small. And it seems like there‚Äôs always something new happening or getting built.

- I miss nature getaways but flights are cheap and quick, so nothing prevents you from going to the nearby countries. People see European mountains and for whatever reason assume that they‚Äôre easily accessible to anyone within minutes. You still have to find transportation, gather some people to save on gas and/or hotels, find time, etc. It‚Äôs not like every European lives next to a mountain, quite the opposite actually. Nature ‚Äúwithin your country borders‚Äù means absolute shit if your country is thousands of kilometers wide.

- Sterile? Lmao, have you stayed in literally any European city for more than a few days? Because that goes stale REALLY quick.

- Some people mention movies? It‚Äôs all the same screenings everywhere wtf? At least Singapore has a decent selection of asian films to offer, while everywhere else it is mostly Hollywood and maybe a couple of local flicks.

- the only major thing that is missing here is concert and festival culture. That is huge and can‚Äôt be replaced by anything.. For those of us who like busy street life, SG can feel a bit boring. On weekends, most of the life seems to be in the malls. The idea of walking around an empty CBD is not my idea of fun. I love it M-F 9-6pm, then it feels like I'm in a big city. Otherwise, it's a ghost town.

Of course, there are neighborhoods that maintain a good buzz day and night, but they aren't close enough together to create a large walkable zone -- think Chinatown, Arab Street, and Little India. The sun intensity and humidity makes walking between them oftentimes not worth the effort. They are also disconnected by urban zoning and physical geography -- Fort Canning Hill, the Padang/civic district, and the undeveloped state of the Weld Road-Arab Street corridor create relatively dead zones (socially speaking). Outside these neighborhoods there are pockets of life, like Jalan Besar, Joo Chiat/Marine Parade, Tiong Bahru, but they are small and again disconnected for those who enjoy cities by foot.. Singapore is interesting for the first few days or weeks. After the novelty wears off, you would realise it's claustrophobic and very man-made. A typical weekends for Singaporean is basically mall hopping, movie, gym and food hunting. If you like outdoor sports, you probably cycle around botanical garden, hike along Bukit Timah or enjoy the sand and sea at Sentosa Island. There's only so much places you can visit in Singapore before you get bored. And the places you can visit really pale compared to our neighbours.. I feel like the lack of seasons here is what makes Singapore boring. Like it's always the same old hot humid city.. Mount Faber, Sentosa, jurong hill, cbd, Marina Bay, Chinatown, woodlands waterfront, ecp, Changi coastal, sengkang waterfront, punggol beach, boon keng area, little India, bugis, sultan mosque, Macritchie, bukit timah hill, chestnut, rifle range, woodcutters trail, Clarke quay, old Tampines trail, airport, Various estates, kallang airport, west coast park, Labrador park, hort park, southern ridges, botanic garden to orchard road, orchard road to botanic gardens, fort canning park, pinnacle duxton.

Gone a dozen times, no. It's boring. I don't have any means of ever making it out of Singapore. So I just stay home these days. Good that you have your sense of romanticism intact.. I've lived in OZ (Brisbane and Melbourne) for a good 3-4 years.I can see why is the favoured destination of migration for most Singaporeans. It is slow, houses are bigger, cars are cheaper etc

but.. what grinds my gear is:

1. How expensive the internet is. I am a tech geek by trade and by hobby. It is darn bloody hard to find a place like Sim Lim Square where I can trawl through the shops for the latest offerings.
2. Shops closes too early. Yea, I am a pure breed city boy.
3. The night life is not bad but not great. 
4. Sorry but I do find Australia fkn boring. Even my OZ classmates laments that.

I personally think, it is good to go out to see the world first and find where your roots are.Mine is stuck deep in Singapore. I think you a bit kee siao liao.

One ex-Melbourne fella was saying can't road trip. No winters, monotone weather. True on all points.

Someone else said sterile, also true. You get lost in the uniformity that is the Singaporean shopping centre, everywhere got the same shops, same layout.

Other than food or shopping, there is nothing to do. Our nature parks are only that big, your perceived plus point of 'GTA-like' ends up being my point of annoyance. There is very little space to just wander about.

I'm blabbering and incoherent. But I hope you get it.. Because the weather is hot and it NEVER changes. Would be great if SG had Cameron/Genting highlands weather. 

But other than that, I agree with everything else you said.. I think that is because Singapore aims to be a one stop shop for everything. 

For example in terms of food. Japan definitely has better Japanese food and Penang definitely have better Chaw kuay tiao. But try to find good ckt in Japan or a good Japanese restaurant in Penang? Singapore on the other hand is able to serve up relatively good stuff for almost all cuisines

This is the same for almost everything. We can't say we have the best arts scene but we are doing... Relatively ok. In terms of nature stuff... We have some but definitely not the top in the world. 

This means that while we try to make everyone happy we are not particularly exciting in any one area and thus nobody is pleased. However i find that Singapore is a fantastic place to live in due to the variety and if I want to find excitement Singapore is the best airline hub in the region with direct flights everywhere.. It's nice if you're into urban exploration (I do enjoy it often on my folding bike) but it's very time and weather dependent. I spend a lot of time doing these alone, but occasionally I crave activities to do with friends/partner/family, but they either find it too physically uncomfortable (humidity, heat, wet weather etc) or not very stimulating (preferring more interactive and engaging activities). If you actively sought fresh ideas for interactive and engaging activities, after the 20th one or so, you'd run out of one or more of three things: ideas, money, or patience for crowds and long queues.

Of course, most of us find something we get hooked onto, which is great and a different story altogether.. Some of my favorite things to do is chartering boats to go to ulu Singaporean islands to fish and camp.. I think it is okay in general.

Just abit homogenous. Kind of lack the surprises when one explore it. This is also related to very strict implementation of government policies which make things organized and uniformed.

Still, it is a small City state so it is awesome for its size.. Making up excuses to leave North Korea. Beheading time. Is not about being boring is about it being less exciting than so many other cities around, Singapore is like a 7 in all categories but it does rarely knock it out of the park in any. 

You can have plenty of fun in Singapore but if you travel you always are amazed by how suddenly you find so much of one item in another city and how sterile and boring Singapore seems in comparison.

Singapore is less than the sum of its part in a strange way. 

At the same time, I am glad to call Singapore my home will recomend it to many people and  I love to explore it and find new ways to enjoy it just being realistic, Arts, nature, sports will never be as big as in other places.. Singapore is actually so rich in biodiversity. I understand why some people don't really like nature that much, but a daytrip to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and a keen eye yields wonders. In just one day I spotted 4 snake species, multiple species of birds(kingfishers, beeeaters, fantails, and more!) And so many more interesting plant and animal species. Personally, I like looking for cool plants and animals and I feel that Singapore's native flora and fauna more than sufficiently quenches my interests in nature.

However, I do agree that our parks and green spaces are getting more crowded day by day. I like right next to the nature reserve and sometimes see throngs of people with headlamps at the base of Bukit timah hill. Can be quite offputting sometimes, especially because alot of animals prefer quiet mornings, and are thus less likely to show themselves when crowds form.

Just speaking from personal experience, everyone has varying interests. I think people tend to overlook Singapore's rich biodiversity sometimes too.

TL;DR Singapore is pretty decent for nature lovers imo. One, maybe it's ""a greener pasture on the other side"" mindset? Big dreams, lack of fulfilment.

Two, for me, once you understand what runs a society, it gets bored, predictable, you can guess every actions and reactions. 

Three, generally according to research, people gets bored once the environment stabilised or when they stop interacting with the environment or people. They don't find meaningful goals or long lasting relationships.

Fyi, foreigner who live and work above 6 months, find Singapore is pretty much easy mode for a lot of things. Maybe too easy or logically setup is by itself wrong? lol

In design theory, it's almost like the city cries for a detournement, in lame man term alternative culture/living.. I don't think the country itself is boring. Coming from less developed country, I can think of a lot of ways to have fun just as long as I have people to do it with.

However, from my experience, Singaporeans either have their schedules full or are rarely willing to step out of their cliques and comfort zone. It really feels that they just punch-in and punch-out of work then go home.

My unqualified opinion is that Singaporeans could use a bit of spontaneity.. > They like to say Singapore has nothing to do, there are no interesting people and there are no interesting places to go to. 

There is always interesting things to do and places to go in Singapore, it's just whether they are willing to search for it.

As for interesting people, ehh doesn't it say more to their social skills?. Aren't those SAF places mentioned protected places i.e. you aren't supposed to go there?. I'm part of the people who thinks Singapore is boring. I've gone on quite a lot of adventures in Singapore like visiting almost all the Nature Park, Museums, cycle at night to MBS, ECP etc. I love hiking generally. Singapore is small. One day there'll be places running out to visit. I think that going overseas or even moving overseas is actually great because you get to experience different cultures, food, people etc rather than staying in Singapore your entire life without experiencing what the world has to offer.. Well, the inside of my cubicle‚Äôs pretty boring. Far too little nature. And far too much of what little is there is fenced off for military use. I wish they would move the shooting ranges and other installations there off the central reservoir area and onto Tekong or up northwest so the whole middle of the island could be open to the public with the east-west hiking trail from Upper Thomson Road could again connect to Bukit Timah.. Different folks, different strokes.. NGL I thought OP was just trolling us by writing a dramatised version of a 24km road march. everythings small and over commercialised. Singapore is pretty boring imo. We are a conservative nation that lack of creativity. Just look at the architectures alone, all the HDB blocks look the same, all the neighbourhood look somewhat uninspiring and similar, even all the kopitiam are templated. There is a joke that if I put you somewhere randomly in the void deck and tell you that you are at Jurong right now, you will believe it because all the void deck look the same. 

Singapore is a rather young and small country that lack of cultural exposure. My colleague from oversea said there's nothing much they can do as a tourist here, therefore many of them just stay for a short period of time.. I used to have that way of thinking before going overseas to study. 

Spending almost 2 decades on an island - it‚Äôs going to feel boring. And there‚Äôs way more attractions and places to go n see overseas. So ofc I wanted to go out and see more, like a bird leaving the nest. 

But when I‚Äôm overseas I kind of feel the opposite now. I live in a suburban area outside of the city at the moment. I lived in suburban Singapore faraway from the cbd area. Comparatively speaking, it‚Äôs really boring where I am. There‚Äôs way more things to do or see within 100m of my place in sg vs where I am currently. Here, I have to go all the way to the city for anything remotely as exciting. 

And while there‚Äôs variety in the weather, it becomes an annoyance after a while. Having to consider what to wear due to the weather forecast everyday - it‚Äôs become a chore. 

Attractions? They‚Äôre that. Attractions. Things you go to once or twice and get bored on the third time seeing it because that magic of seeing something amazing for the first time is gone. Unless the activity you do there differs la but it‚Äôll still eventually get boring looking at the same mountains and canyons. 

Basically I think Singapore is still boring, but not that boring. There‚Äôs actually a lot of events going on that most of us aren‚Äôt aware of, or don‚Äôt bother going. Even without events, there‚Äôs just activity going on all the time. If you wanna eat out at 2am, there‚Äôs places for you to go besides fast food places. And everything‚Äôs insanely convenient. 

When I talk to locals who want to go to Singapore for their holidays, it‚Äôs always fascinating to see how they view our boring little island. To them SG is this jammed packed island of attractions (even though they only went to MBS/Sentosa area lol). Even those that came back from Singapore on holiday - after spending a whole week somemore somehow - would still say it was fun and there was a lot of things to do. Also overwhelming food variety because why not. 

Anyway tl;dr the grass is always greener on the other side lol.. I'm one of those who thinks Singapore is boring, but when I try to explore, I'm amazed by what I have not yet found.

I'm nostalgic for those places in Singapore that's not yet developed, or those that are seemingly frozen in time. Places like Kampung Lor Buangkok, Sungei Buloh, I have found those interesting enough compared to the shopping centres.

But places like these are different:

Bukit Brown, 
Murai Farmway, 
Springleaf Park Connector, 
Mandai Track 17 - Upper Seletar Reservoir, 
Ulu Sembawang Park Connector (former Jalan Ulu Sembawang), 
Sungei Tengah region, and the 
Masjid Pertempatan Melayu Singapura at Sembawang (near the former Kampung Wak Hassan) 

I feel like these places have largely retained a certain sense of old Singapore pre-Independence, definitely not boring to me personally, though I must admit the air can be musty but tropical rainforests do have that heavy, moist air that rises with heat.

I agree that Singapore does not have distinct warm and cool seasons, but we're in the tropics, so that is one thing we must learn to adapt to.

Singapore is unique, and although the recent redevelopments has erased a great deal of the old landscape, I'm still glad that some pockets remain, and hopefully remain untouched as much as possible.. I personally like grand nature scenery. I also like the take photographs. Singapore is a good city to take city shots but there are only so many you can take. If you want green fields, with snow mountains, waterfalls and rivers, you're outta luck. Maybe being born here makes us deprived for natural scenery.

And I personally hate the heat and humidity. Like others have mentioned, try walking for more than 30 mins outdoors and you'll probably end up desiring to rush to the nearest aircon shopping centre. The heat and humidity just kills whatever outdoor enthusiasm you have. And most of the time, you'd just wish you stayed at home. Which brings up the next problem. Every shopping centre now seems to be just copy and pasted. Same shops everywhere. The old, unique ones like Sim Lim Square are dying off. Plus I am not the shopping person. 

The food here though is unparalleled, maybe only by other Asian countries. But I wouldn't trade our good food for any other country's.. I don't think Singapore is boring in itself, but after spending 8 months abroad in uni i realized that what i find most stifling about Singapore is how all of life here seems to revolve around the family. It can definitely be explained using the state's reproductive politics (see teo you yenn's neoliberal morality in singapore) but the simplest factor has to do with how small the island is and you really have to put in the effort to be your own, independent person with space to explore and express yourself without being reminded every second that your life only matters if you plan to settle down and get married and have kids by the time you're 32.. I moved to the US 4 years ago for graduate school, and I now live in San Francisco (I'm 29).

Boredom really varies from person to person - someone may find enjoying the night views at CBD and the sights around singapore, while others may not. I've walked around the Marina Barrage at night, strolled down City Hall to Raffles place, caught the sunsets at many different places in Singapore. There's really a lot of beauty in Singapore. And sure there's many secret hidden spots to see in Singapore like you said.

But what else? What is there to DO in Singapore? Perhaps you can go to the Wavehouse to ""surf"", but how does that compare to surfing real waves in other countries? Perhaps you can hit the beautiful bars in Clarke Quay, but then there's many times more dynamic and exotic bars in San Francisco. You can hike around Bukit Timah and Macritchie, but there's also thousands of beautiful trails near San Francisco, with much more variation on sights and geography and difficulty. A 4 hour drive and I can spend the weekend skiing in the mountains, which I do every two weeks, but I can't in Singapore. 

I do love Singapore, but I do find it boring because there's few things to do, and so little variations on the things that I could do in Singapore. Every shopping mall is basically the same as every other, just skinned a little differently (Thanks CapitaMall), every bar feels the same, with similar music or similar offerings. I believe it's due to how Singaporeans are fairly averse to trying new and untested territory, and it shows in how most things look very cookie cutter. Sure, there are a few exceptions, but they are few and far between.

Another thing is just that there's only so much you can see and do in Singapore in the many years there (25 for me) before you get bored of them all. I've only been in San Francisco for 4 years, but maybe in 10 I'll be bored of this place too, and find a new home elsewhere. It's amazing how much Singapore can cram into its tiny island, but at the end of the day, there's only that many things you can squeeze into this tiny island.

Singapore is just like a video game map, something out of GTA, where every block you walk, it looks the same as the one before.. Yes, you're a siaolang.. You just do not get the WTF moments in Singapore. It is nice but even the drunks tend to be polite and well behaved for some reason. I lived there for 7 years and never felt that something surprising was going to happen. Nice but a little crazy makes a city.. I think its referring to the general attitude and mindset of Singaporean people. Basically the kiasu, kiasi mentality. The Singapore society is very against risk taking, everyone wants to do the test and proven way to get the best result. Nobody wants to stay from the proven path and try something new. At workplace, its just keeping your head down and not disturbing the flow. Everyone claims they love feedback but nobody really wants it. 

I remember my workplace, most people don't socialize after marriage. They just want to go home immediately. Nothing wrong with that but that's what boring is I guess.. There's an elephant in the room...  
(Source: 35. Born in Hong Kong (gweilo/heiren). Lived in London 25 years, NY until last year.)

Illegal drug use in London and to a lesser extent NY is prevalent. Especially in middle class/work culture. You smell weed in the air every single day walking through the Southbank (where I lived) in London. Overseas clients, colleagues and friends of mine do cocaine very regularly and will smoke weed if offered (for the record I've never even smoked a cigarette). It feels as if it is unpoliced. If you go to festivals across Europe - even tame ones like Sonar (which my company goes to every year on a team bonding/downtime thing) - drug use is out in the open.

Drink and drugs are a vehicle for all sorts of activity. Including sexual activity.

Singapore doesn't have that social lubricant, and so the likelihood of going out and something ""happening""  - taking something you shouldn't, sleeping with someone you shouldn't - is lower. For people seeking thrills, or who just want to be thrill adjacent, I bet Singapore feels boring.

As a happily married office monkey who doesn't seek out any alternative lifestyle or illegal activity, Singapore is a lot of fun to me. There are more of my kind of people here. Although I might prove the opposite point because maybe I am boring \^-\^. I think relative to other countries it boring af. If you have travelled alot what Singapore has to offer is next to nothing.

For instance, I am studying in the UK. A simple weekend or day trip can consist of exploring a whole different city with it's own landmarks, food and culture. Not to mention the whole of Europe is a simple hour or two away.

The weather in sg contributes to the negatives too. It's so damn hot 90% of the year. size matters. live so long in this small country bound to get boring. but its only fair if you compare it to other fellow city, and not whole country/continent. like australia would have to be compared to whole south east asia just for fairness in size. 

touching on interesting people. yes we are small, and our people rather homogenous. our history is immigrants, diverse but large emphasis on living together. for other country like japan, they have very rooted and old culture to explore. people living in this city can have culture very different from another city. so different, i think local tourist is a thing there haha. 

now back at sg... the best i can do with my friends is just say jurong people weird weird one. haha. we try to make things lively but ya, its all the same.. I'm a homebody so I'm totally satisfied with how Singapore is lol. Whenever I go overseas I appreciate how convenient Sg is eg. 5mins walk to 7-11 regardless of where you are. Most of the time I spent overseas were also just shopping and tourist attractions which Sg also technically has? I don't do any night life so no comments in that regard.. Idk man have you ever been to anywhere else? It's not like Singapore is the best or worst place on earth, but it's pretty average for a medium-sized world city, and most people living in cities in the world go out from time to time. It's kind of hard to be more than boring when your entire country encompasses one location. No change of scenery without a passport.. I tot you were a foreigner , until i read your last sentence. i dont mind singapore, it has everything i need to sustain my physical body comfortably while i live my life in the vr world. As someone relatively new to Singapore, I can safely say that there's not much to see. You can cover all the places to go to in less than a week.

After a while it becomes more about the company you have than the places to go to.. That sounds really boring tbh.

But I think it's just the size of our country. In other countries, day trips to far sides are really exciting and really feels like a new part of ""town"".. Car.

Things that Say to do needs a car. No car no talk! üöó. I don't agree that Singapore is boring, but I can totally understand why that want to venture overseas to broaden their horizons.. Aside from landscape and infrastructure, it‚Äôs the monotony and sameness of the people in Singapore. There are exceptions but pretty much everyone is busy trying to make ends meet, which usually means working in jobs or conditions they hate.

And people‚Äôs appearances... cookie cutter because mostly they have a strict dress code or simply following societal norms.

Lack of civic activities where people just get together to do stuff they like, without being part of some formal organization.. I like Singapore. However, it is considered boring because of its sterile and artificial nature. The Singapore you see is a curated experience which is very good in many ways but at the same time is devoid of authenticity. It's something abstract and not easy to put in words. This makes the place a bit boring.

However, if you are a local and you are willing to get your hands dirty, there are places you can experience authentic Singapore.. Singaporean here. Lived in NYC for 17 years (but visited Singapore every year since 2002) and have travelled to over 30 countries....

IMHO (and echoing the most upvoted responses), Singapore ‚Äúfeels‚Äù boring because it lacks a lot of soul-nourishing intangibles that make life ‚Äúfun‚Äù, like:

- Vistas of nature, e.g. mountains, flowing rivers, wildlife. Humans are programmed by evolution to love nature because it‚Äôs the wellspring for life. Different people from big cities to small African tribes react differently to man-made objects but everyone (regardless of religion, wealth, ethnicity, etc) reacts positively to beautiful vistas of nature, and we simply don‚Äôt have a lot of this in Singapore. 

- Seasons, e.g. snow, spring flowers, fall foliage. It‚Äôs almost a metaphor for life itself. Singapore‚Äôs hot and humid climate near the equator is considered ‚Äúoppressive‚Äù to human comfort. In fact, the vast majority of humans live in sub-tropical and temperate zones, and virtually all major cities (with more than 5m pop) are outside the equatorial zone. So, Singapore‚Äôs climate is unusual for a big city, and despite the abundance of parks and green space in Singapore, the climate deters the enjoyment of the outdoors.

- Static culture and social milieu. Singapore has a very strong culture for work and economic success because of the government‚Äôs social engineering. This is good for building wealth but the culture of play is neglected (or suppressed). There is a very strong sense that play should serve a bigger purpose other than enjoyment itself, and most Singaporeans I know prioritize work over play - this is actually the opposite of ‚Äúfun‚Äù cultures (eg US, Southern Europe, South America) where people work to play. Singaporeans also frequently feel judged (by peers, family and society) so there is a lot of self-restraint and self-consciousness. Orderly behavior is encouraged...

- Limited diversity. Yes, Singapore is multi-ethnic but our way of life is oddly homogeneous across ethnicities. Also, success in Singapore is narrowly defined and synonymous with economic success. In NYC (for contrast, but also true in other big cities), everyone celebrates many forms of success, eg sports, performing artists, fashion design, cookery, music, etc. The tacit agreement is everyone will pursue what they like and we can all enjoy the fruits of the diverse pursuits in museums, Broadway, film, fashion, restaurants, sports, etc. It feels ‚Äúfun‚Äù to experience other people‚Äôs dreams and ambitions because they are so different from your own!

TL;DR Singapore feels ‚Äúboring‚Äù because the climate (socioeconomic, equatorial, cultural) is highly homogenized. While we enjoy a very high standard of physical comforts, we‚Äôre short of the intangibles that make humans feel alive.. I used to think Singapore is boring. After all, I grew up in Singapore and I've seen so much of it, and I know all of Singapore's major flaws. After being in the midwest for over half a decade however, I can't even say that I think Singapore is boring with a straight face anymore.

Imagine being surrounded by corn for hundreds of kilometres out, and the nearest ""large"" city isn't something any urban East or SE Asian would call large. I love astronomy, and initially the easy access to dark skies was amazing, but now I'd very much rather be in Singapore. I'd still have easy access to Bintan or Kota Tinggi anyway. Even Chicago seemed a little boring after a while (ie. not worth the \~3 hour drive). The touristy attractions (navy pier, Shedd, etc.) feel like a poor man's version of comparable attractions in Singapore, and while the food culture is similarly diverse, it feels overly anglo-centric. Getting good Chinese, Korean, or Japanese food is not impossible but you definitely have to go out of your way. Even the pizza gets boring. The only thing I really love about Chicago is the Art Institute.

On top of that, in Singapore, you can hop on a plane and go to a completely different culture on a whim. You don't even have to be rich, a weekend in Thailand costs a few hundred; something any middle-class individual could splurge on once in a while. This sounds silly; after all, how is ease of travel a benefit of Singapore? The thing is, though, if you live in a larger country (US, China, India), are surrounded by larger countries (Korea, Japan), or just live far from all but a couple countries (Aus, NZ, or even worse, Hawaii), travel tends to be prohibitively expensive. If I wanted to get out of the US and go to a place that actually feels like a different culture, and I have a budget of under a thousand SGD, I have one choice: Mexico. Sure, the US is more diverse, but the difference between California and Indiana isn't even as big as Singapore and Thailand.

I can see how Singapore would be considered boring for people who just really fucking love mountains and snow, or who have lived in another country for less than a year and haven't gotten over the honeymoon phase yet. I loved the midwest for two whole years. (I mean my town, but I don't want to get too specific) I loved my first winter here; now the fact that it's almost November feels me with dread. I loved the small town charm; now I just wish there was a fucking supermarket within walking distance. It took a long time for the novelty to wear off, at least for me. It takes a while before you see the flaws of a new place and start longing for home. And now, everytime I go back to Singapore I discover how much I was missing out on before I left simply because I thought Singapore was boring and I couldn't be arsed to explore.. Singapore isnt boring. The fun parts just arent potrayed very easily, compared to other countries such as new zealand, where pictures of nature are much more alluring. 

But if boring means stable government, low corruption, safe and top quality healthcare and education, i dont see an issue.. SG has so many hidden gems, its just that people dont have time. We're such a small but busy country, with students who go to school/study for most of their life going to only sentosa or orchad during their holidays. Adults work from 9-5 everyday and take leave to go on a holiday because they don't know about the beauty of so many islands that sg has! We're put in a position where enjoying views is mostly done through watching travelogues on tv or social media, which rarely features our small small country, and thus make us feel that sg is inferior :'(

I encourage kids to be a lil more adventurous, and during this holiday, go out and explore the many modern and cultural beauties and sg holds, and bring them into the spotlight ! orchard and sentosa have been hogging it for too long). Cacophony is not the right word. Just say overwhelming.. Probably because Singapore is pretty monotone. 
There aren‚Äôt many differences between each community and architecture is pretty similar. 

But given the land and resource restraints, this is necessary.  People need affordable housing and even though fancy condos got interesting designs, the majority would prefer affordable housing instead.  The newer HDBs certainly have a different modern look, and Singapore will always rebuild itself.  It‚Äôs a city that has to change with the times to survive.  Not bad at all, despite qualms about loosing ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù places.  I do find Singapore really unique and it‚Äôs a place that you‚Äôll miss if you leave. 

But my favorite place to live in has to be Japan.  Mainly because they have trains! I have flight anxiety and if I want to leave Singapore I have to take a flight.  I would love living in Singapore so much more if Singapre was connected to the rest of SEA via trains instead.  :( 

My boyfriend interned in Japan for a bit, so I visited him there for some time.  We stayed in Osaka, our little 1LDK was right next to Umeda, it was super convenient location.  During the weekend we‚Äôd go to Kyoto. Kyoto is a totally different type of city.  I loved Kyoto‚Äôs landscape and architecture.  It‚Äôs a beautiful place with beautiful gardens and shrines.  Going back to Umeda is like going back to the modern world.  We also took the Shinkasen to Kobe, and took the train to Nara.  I loved Nara.  We also took the chance to visit Tokyo.  It was a different feel.  I actually prefer Osaka.  

That being said, each place is unique, and all were better than the months which I stayed in the US.  My BF went to US for internship too, so I visited too and that was an interesting experience.  We were in Philly, it was raining, and some random guy came up and tried to grab our umbrella! Never had that experience living in Asia, ever! I was seriously scared of being shot... or robbed.  We did not go out after dark... unlike in Singapore which we went out for midnight movies all the time and walk home from the theater.. aww your post actually made me so nostalgic! i feel like Singapore really is under appreciated. As someone who spent 4 years overseas, now that I'm back it just makes me treasure what is here even more. In the UK things would shut at 6 (ya no lie, lol) and even though obv there are nice parks/nature/events like xmas markets, really nothing compares to home. Maybe I'm just Singaporean till I die kind haha but a lot of these events/places depend on you to seek out yourself! So if you lazy or what then don't say that there is nothing to do bc there always is, only whether you wanna go or not. Just my 2 cents haha. I like cars. The end.. OP I'm currently in LA for a business trip and let me tell you it's urban planning makes KL look well planned. But something about it here. The vibe, the people, there's so much to do and everything is made here in America. 

No doubt Singapore has its upsides but the best restos are all imported from overseas, the best art exhibitions or music shows are imported from overseas, architecture is cool but let's be honest how long can you really stare at a building for? 

In all its efforts to import the best global shows, restaurants, food chains, shops etc something gets lost along the way and it comes off as a bit sterile and lost in translation. Compare this to our other neighbours like Bangkok or even Jakarta. Heck even KL where they don't necessarily have the best french restaurant or world class concerts or Broadway shows so the locals have to create their own shows, exhibits and build their own homegrown brands with local flavours (sometimes I'm in Singapore and I think I could be in Melbourne or any other city). This makes for a somewhat more organic, raw and less sterile vibe to a city thats more underground and not always govt sanctioned. 

KL doesn't market it's street food as well as Singapore (which imo better than sg food) but that creates a more interesting, less ""mainstream"" experience where food is hidden and not turned into tourist traps (sorry Newton) sometimes you don't have to be numba 1 to have a cool vibe in a city. 

Just my 2 sen.. Sorry I‚Äôm team boring. First, as many mentioned, Singapore has no nature to offer. Pretty much any country around are better in this aspect, not to mention ANZ or Europe. The weather and season has no change at all, a word ‚Äúhot‚Äù can describe it all. And it‚Äôs not suitable for outdoor activities.

CBD is gorgeous, that‚Äôs true. But there are plenty of cities can offer the same or better experience even only in Asia( Tokyo, Shanghai, HK, Seoul). 

Entertainment in Singapore is poor. Night life is expensive and very limited. The local television programs are just horrible to watch. Not allow to use Pornhub or other major adult website( I wonder why prostitution is allowed but not porn?). Local culture products are very low quality.

What‚Äôs the most popular activity in weekend for most people in Singapore? That‚Äôs right, let‚Äôs got to another new but similar shopping mall owned by Capital Land.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do like a lot about Singapore, but Singapore is just not a place for fun and colorful life.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend people to travel to Singapore. But for work and a stable family life, this is the place.. Because weed is illegal here. Basically all the really fun stuff are either banned or moneygated.. Don‚Äôt even. I‚Äôm trying to move to Singapore. I feel like I‚Äôll fit in with your community better than where I‚Äôm from. I met so many Singaporean friends in exchange and I realised that I can definitely pass off as Singaporean. You might think your country is boring but trust me you‚Äôre being envied by many.. Can I generalize it and say that those are probably the type of people who open up their walk-in closets and say that there's nothing to wear?. As one of the people who moved, I can tell you I certainly didn't move because Singapore is boring. In fact I miss being able to access so many things so easily. It was so easy to find something to do on the weekends. 
I left because I felt like an outsider in my own country. I miss it a lot but I have been much happier living away from home.. What you value in terms of attraction probably falls out the majority of people who say that SG is boring. What i'm getting a sense of is that people who say that have seen the very big attraction in other country with the culture and all that you can't find in SG. SG is small af so it's not a unreasonable statement to say that SG might be boring.. Idk I‚Äôm from California and just went to NUS for spring semester and I loved it....I miss Singapore so much and do truly want to move there some day. Such a great place, plus I honestly think CA is boring. Sure you can say there‚Äôs everything here....but I honestly have no interest in staying after I graduate.. Try living somewhere else long term. 

I can't imagine living in that tiny island forever.  

Sure, it's great you have everything you need taken care of. 

But you're living like a caged pet. like literally, HDBs are like cages in a tree.. Sadly we can't do anything about the size and the weather of Singapore.. It‚Äôs because all of us are living our daily lives here, and daily life, for the most part, is filled with not extremely interesting things like work, chores, obligations, kids, etc. that take up most of our time. 

Of course this rut is going to be a lot more boring to us than what we perceive of other countries - especially if we‚Äôre comparing Singapore to countries that we‚Äôve in holidayed in.. A place is only as boring as the person saying it's boring.

If a person isn't a boring person, then even the simple act of reading a book on a sunday or doing some outdoor runs at East Coast Park will be exciting.

If a person is a boring person him/herself, then you can bring/her to the surface of mars to explore and all you will get out of him/her is a mere 'Meh'.. yap be adventurous dun just stick to the shopping malls and cineplexes. I wish my country was as 'boring' as Singapore.. I usually don't take such people's comments so seriously. Complaining is a past time of Singaporeans and I posit that their complains are simply a projection of their unhappiness in their own lives. (sorry if anyone feels offended here)

That being said I do share these sentiments at times. Shopping malls are almost a must-have in every neighbourhood and we can always expect to find familiar brands in there (e.g. Uniqlo, Cotton On, Fairprice/Cold storage, Din Tai Fung/Koufu, some bubble tea shop etc etc.) and there is little to distinguish each mall from the other. Shophouses near the HDBs are filled with hairstylists, manicure/pedicure, tuition centres

That being said I think we can lower our expectations a little. It *is* a tactic for social media content creators to over-hype gimmicks and features in other countries.. I love Singapore. But I also find myself longing for overseas just because its been 30 odd years of me in this sunny island. I haven't even got to experience winter. 

But I am quite sure my heart is still here in Singapore.. Are you married? If no, then you'll won't understand if we say that the island is boring. *shrugs*. My take is that Singapore is awesome, but it does get boring rather quickly as the number of things to do is limited. Street food is limitless but it‚Äôs not the same for activites and discovering new bars and restaurants. After a year or two you quickly fall for a daily routine with similar Weekend activities.

I‚Äôve now been living in Dubai for 5 years, and have not done the same thing twice during weekends in over 5 years. Lifestyle is very different (good and bad), but I still feel that everyday is different and every week brings it‚Äôs new truckload of surprises, it‚Äôs much easier to get out of your comfort zone and experience new things.

Singapore however, in unmatched in terms of great lifestyle with amazing travel destinations close by, but the number of paid time off is much too low to truly take advantage of that. With 5 to 6 weeks off in Dubai, I find myself traveling around Singapore much more often than what I used to living there.. Nahhhh not a siaolang for sure! It's funny but the more I travel, the more I'm able to appreciate Singapore's beauty. The city skyline is one of those things that I feel was done right and I'm darn proud of it! Same with friends who left Singapore for studies/ work, they start appreciating the little conveniences like, being able to go out for supper at any hour, not seeing trash or smelling pee every single day on the way home, etc etc

If I ever leave, it's most likely for other reasons and not because this is a boring place. As for the people you described, could be a ""grass is greener on the other side"" kind of mindset? Every city has its up and downsides and I guess it really depends on what you value more.. People define the place. I think people in Singapore are quite shy and keep to themselves (at least in public) and it's hard to find people who are outspoken and open to sharing their ideas with you without first having established a long friendship. So for most part our social circles are drawn and defined in school, and it's hard to get excited meeting new people? But all relative la, I lived in the US.. It depends on what the person has experienced in his or her life of course. OP, where in the world have you traveled to or lived in?. I think many Singaporeans take the safety here for granted. When I go overseas, it is not uncommon for locals to advise against travelling alone after dark or to hold your bag/belongings tightly. You don't hear that in Singapore.. For me it‚Äôs cause there‚Äôs really not much going on other than mainstream culture. 

Go to the majority of clubs and bars and it‚Äôs all top 40s EDM, Hip Hop and radio rock cover bands. Although, I have found some local bands that I like such as CB Dogs and Bad Dod but those sort of far out experiences are just few and far between.

Also there‚Äôs not really much to see and places to go. Can‚Äôt really change this due to the size of Singapore. I feel there‚Äôs just not much room for expression and most of the people I‚Äôve met don‚Äôt want to really explore anything other than the norm. 

There‚Äôs nothing really wrong with this it‚Äôs just what made Singapore boring for me 

I will add that Singapore does have some fantastic art exhibits and I‚Äôve throughly enjoyed exploring some of them.. I‚Äôm in the camp of Singapore being really boring. Walking through the CBD at night can be quite pleasant but you have to try walking through a city like Seoul or Tokyo on a winters night the experience is unparalleled.. Nature. Theres no nature hinterland to escape to. People who live in cities elsewhere do that. Also, the fooking weather. And the fooking crowds everywhere.. At least the heat only lasts 3 months! And heat waves don‚Äôt go for the full 3 months. 

In Melbourne anyway!. whats cbd?. Walking through CBD gets stale quick. Heck, walking through any part of Singapore is a chore due to the temperature. 

However, it is thanks to this boredom that Singapore is safe/sanitised so I guess I'm grateful? I still would like to travel regularly if possible though.. Honestly as a student, I find Singapore pretty boring. My friends and I are not really interested in going for walks by the beach or finding some out of the way cafe that have 10$ bread. Places that are of interest like uss(though getting kinda bored), vr parks, movies or big malls like jewel are either too expensive, too far(I live in west) or age limits like vr parks. Sometimes movies have nothing of interest. Currently my favourite places to go will be badminton or bowling, cuz they're for everyone, reasonably priced and kinda convenient.. Those same people would like get bored no matter where they live.

I live in Australia and Singapore is one of the only other places I‚Äôve considered living in. It‚Äôs an amazing city where the benefits far outweigh the negatives. 

Plus if you get bored it‚Äôs so easy to travel somewhere nearby with so many direct flights to other great holiday destinations just a short stop away.. I think there's a decent range of cultural activities if you know where to look but probably less than other cities of equivalent size. A lot of activities can be gated by cost, including our culinary culture which is getting increasing commercialised. We have less of a rich tradition than countries with a longer span of existence. It can also be harder to meet interesting people since a majority of the population is just striving for economic goals. As for nature, it might be unfair to compare Singapore with cities in bigger countries where there is nature that's accessible without needing to cross borders. Overall I do find it not too boring to live in, but probably not in the top tier globally.. i like shopping, but everything in singapore is very generic. in tokyo, places like shimokitazawa (hope i spelled correctly) and of course harajuku have much more interesting stuff. i like thrifting as well, and singapore thrift stores suck. every country i‚Äôve went to (except really rural countries) have better thrift stores. if you wanna find something good here you need to shell out $50 for an overpriced vintage store, but even then they only have those few streetwear brands.

beaches aren‚Äôt that interesting. the waves are pathetic. (i will say that we aren‚Äôt at risk of tsunamis but in this area it‚Äôs just boring). cbd is nice but it gets old real quick. and as others mentioned, the weather makes it uncomfortable to hike and stuff.

although i do like sg, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs safe, peaceful and clean, not because it‚Äôs interesting.. Having things to do doesn‚Äôt make something interesting. 

You have almost unlimited activities to do on your computer, but you still want to do other things apart from your using your computer right? 

Same perspective if you consider singapore. No matter how many interesting activities we have, nothing can change the fact that our land size is tiny, and our arts and culture isn‚Äôt as rich and old. Just like how some people can spend the whole day indoors and some can‚Äôt, some people will be satisfied with Singapore while some won‚Äôt. No right or wrong.. Whenever u hear people say ""xxx place is boring"", it doesnt mean that xxx has nothing to do. It means that xxx has nothing of interest to that specific someone.

Singapore is known as a rich's man(woman) playground so you cannot say it has ""nothing to do"". Rather, it has many things to do but you just need a good amount of cash (which a normal person doesnt have readily available).

For eg, riding a super sports car, flying a helicopter, having a party on a yacht...all these are not ""boring"". So what i am saying is that it is all subjected to the person's interest and circumstances.. If I see a crocodile at Pandan Reservoir ,I'm hoping there aren't many people around. It's so damn small and leads to doing and seeings basically the same things over the years. Nice to live for 3-4 years imo. but not more than that.  Sure, I can travel to different parts every weekend and then after a few weeks or months I've basically explored 90% of the entire city/country. Singapore has good shopping and food, some decent sights, some other small cultural parts and that's about it. Nothing other bigger cities don't do just as good, if not better while also offering more, especially in other aspects like nature, ease of travel within the country to other cities, cultural options etc.  There are some options in SG, but so many things are controlled and behind a significant paywall. Different priorities. I've lived in almost 10 different countries and Singapore is probably around 5-6 for me in the big picture tbh

Certain people would love living in Singapore and enjoy the city every day, while others would kill to be anywhere else.

 My 0.02. I don't think Singapore is boring at all, coming from an Australian / Canadian/Hong Konger.

Your country is beautiful and clean. Though I have say, the people of Singapore is what make the place awesome, very kind and great sense of humour (the Singlish jokes).. When you live too long in a too peaceful nation you start earning for other things. I love to live here but not have my holidays here haha. The only thing I see as a downside outside the lack of nature destinations, even then, we still has many parks to stroll in. But overall, Singapore has many interesting places to explore. Maybe people are easily influenced by what other say and are quick to judge.

Also, I love walking around Singapore at night too. It‚Äôs peaceful but not too quiet that it feels creepy(?) It‚Äôs really relaxing, only that I don‚Äôt have time to do so very often. We could also easily walk around, having breakfast at one place and walking to another place for lunch.. I lived in Singapore for a year and I think the biggest thing for me was that after a few months you usually have seen most of the attractions.
And malls man malls. If we gotta go eat? Go to mall. Go grocery shopping go to a mall. Also, it‚Äôs  hot af everyday which makes being outside super tiring.. As the saying goes... The perceptions.. The grass is always greener elsewhere.. I am Chinese/Lao from Toronto and I absolutely adore Singapore.  I've only visited once last year with my wife.  It was both of our first trip, and was highly recommended by my director who worked for a few years in SG.  My wife has been back thrice now for short trips.  I think if you stay anywhere for long enough, it starts to lose it's charm.  I realize this is coming from a tourist, but I don't think Singapore is boring.    

I missed the food in Singapore so much that a few months after our first SG trip, my wife and I were in Osaka and trying to get to Bangkok.  We were flying using frequent flyer points, so we had a few options, including a direct business class flight to Bangkok on Thai Airways, we instead chose to fly with SIA on business that had a layover in Singapore, so we could stop by again, if only for a few hours.. Singapore feels very sterile. While great for safety, it makes the island feel boring.. It's not boring for its size.. For a lot of people it‚Äôs also the familiarity that makes Singapore boring. And Singapore being so small, it‚Äôs easy to become familiar with it very quickly. I guess that applies to any city ‚Äî a lot of people don‚Äôt want to live where they grew up. I do love Singapore, but having grown up here and also lived overseas, I crave for more overseas experiences over local ones.. Curious about your last reference to GTA. üòÑ As in the famous Grand Theft Auto game? Would love to hear how you think sg is as amazing as Gta üòÑ

Also, where are you from?. Walk everywhere, all you see are trees and HDB flats. Tell me how is that not boring?
Nonetheless, there's something to tranquil about walking around the streets. Singapore might be boring but there's many special things about it. I feel that we are too busy in general to have quality time. It's all relative of course, but after living in NYC Singapore was very boring for me. The good thing about Singapore is it offers lots of close, cheap destinations which is pretty awesome. Or at least it did when I lived there - not sure what the situation is now with budget airlines. They were getting more expensive towards the end of my stay in SG. Based on what u have said abour geography, the people here like really strange things, and i am no different. Also from the fact that you called singapore a gta map, I do understand that, but we have stricter laws than most countries. One petty reason I have.. is bc Singapore likes to demolish things. Pearl bank, Sentosa Merlion, abandoned buildings, you name it. I understand that it‚Äôs bc of space constraints but still. It‚Äôs like destroying a piece of culture whenever they do this.

I‚Äôm pretty interested in urban exploration and there‚Äôs a fairly small amount of places we can explore (without getting chased by the mata or getting swarmed by mosquitos in the woods) lol. Compared to Taiwan; they just leave their abandoned buildings out for everyone to explore, they aren‚Äôt cordoned off or anything. They‚Äôre just there, remaining as a part of their culture that they can look back on.. I always explain it this way:

Some cities are exciting through their mere existence.  Just by being in that city you are going to encounter interesting people and events.  There's a certain amount of chaos that is desirable and it keeps us on our toes in a way that makes things feel a bit more visceral.

Singapore is not one of those cities.

However, that is not to say that you can't find exciting, intriguing, and chaotic things going on in Singapore--you just have to put the effort into finding them.

That being said (and as others have already mentioned), one of the things that you really can't find readily in Singapore is grand landscapes.  Some people crave easy access to adventure.  Yes, you can find that pretty easily by hopping on a plane or a boat and heading to other nearby countries, but that is a lot more of an obstacle compared to hopping in your car and driving for a few hours.. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a siaolang and while I wouldn‚Äôt be so sentimental about it, I‚Äôm on the side that thinks Singapore is an interesting place to live.

Agree about the ‚Äúunknown‚Äù, ‚Äúunexplored‚Äù plces that are lurking beyond instagram, like parks that nobody goes to because it‚Äôs too hot. Or sunsets that are too inconvenient for busy Singaporeans to travel to. If you look hard enough to bother to check what‚Äôs behind the regular tourist attractions, you‚Äôll find places more fun than just hanging out in shopping malls. Although having lived overseas I‚Äôm always very glad for shopping malls because they offer free public spaces to sit around and enjoy aircon! 

I find people I meet in Singapore more interesting than they‚Äôre usually given credit for. Maybe because everything is said so matter-of-factly or because all we do is complain, it seems very sterile on a superficial level. But I like the repression and the passive aggressiveness because there are always underlying tensions or dynamics beneath daily communication (or miscomm). These tensions depend on the social configuration or on the context or space that the conversation is happening in. Then it‚Äôs up to my imagination to fill in the blanks and to observe people‚Äôs behaviour to see if they really do what they say, or say what they do. I think Singaporeans have a lot to hide, and I‚Äôm here for all the everyday microdrama, ready to help provoke or escalate if needed. 

That said, time away from Singapore is always good to gain fresh perspective. And probably also to save your sanity because Singapore is really way too small. What definitely makes it seem sterile is the convenience and size. Seems to me most people‚Äôs experiences fall into a very limited band, and so there‚Äôs no way of knowing what‚Äôs very fun or amazing or creative because we conversely don‚Äôt know the meaning of very lacking or very poor or suffering. In which case you need to be somewhere else for a bit to learn how to open your mind to other worldviews or maybe just embrace a wider range of emotion.. As an outsider who really enjoys Singapore I can only put myself in other people's shoes. And I can see why westerners might thinks its boring. It seems very over regulated and there is no real ""adventure"" since everything is so planned out. There it seems like Singapore has no ""wild"" side. I'm comparing it to other cities like London, Paris, Amsterdam or Hamburg. Which are old and long grown cities. They have sides from different periods of time. Which is also what makes them more diverse than Singapore.
Never less when I look at Singapore I see the future and a lot of concepts of housing, public transport and city planing that I find very interesting (in the best way). But I can understand that if you grew up there it all seems... Ordinary, which it totally isn't. You have to move out first to see what you got. My hypothesis is that those who actually move out of Singapore because its boring are missing it after a certain time, because they finally realise what they had.. Exhibit A: Snow. I just think everything you can do in singapore  you can do anywhere else, also singapore has no own culture yet. Millennials are trying to build the singaporean proud nation. Because everyone there immigrated from somewhere else or is a child of an immigrant. Yes there is so many cultures in one place and very very good food. But again that can be found in many other countries as well. Singapore has a lot to offer but is not in it's full potential. Also let's not get political but that's also something that needs to be fixed. i kind of empathize with the people portion of that statement. I realized that overseas, people and strangers are much more open and willing to start random conversations. But here in SG, if you are seated beside at the bar of a cafe (for eg.) If you were to suddenly strike a conversation, there is a certain ""closed-offness"" that they emit. They tend to come off abit weary and judgemental and become usually awkward. 

However overseas, it's pretty common to ""meet new people"" on a regular basis.

Then again, not saying that everyone is like that. But the majority are, and it's rare for random, open and chill conversations.. Many of the things you said, you'll only start to appreciate when you've stayed overseas for an extended time. Singapore is fine as a city but as a country, it's just way too small and stifling. I used to think traveling from Jurong to Paris Ris was a long journey until I went on exchange in Europe.. its just the weather and lack of nature. if we compare city to city, im pretty sure singapore will be one of the better choice.. Because they are boring. Because the grass is always greener on the other side. Singaporeans need to learn to appreciate the simpler things in life. Just try things, you'll never know that you love it until you tried it.. You can have plenty of fun in a vast array of things here.

The only things we truly lack is natural sceneries that you can get elsewhere, and a good work/life balance.  
Though you can work on the latter depending on the employer.

If I'm leaving, it would likely be due to the high cost of living. You can get a big house, a pool, and a car in some other countries with what you pay for for a HDB here.

Edit: Typo.. I think what they meant is their life. The only reason I can come up with is that SG is too tiny, which causes generally similar life styles among people no matter where you live. In comparison, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have much more various life styles, natural landscapes and rural sceneries. But being tiny is not that bad. It's just a personal preference.. I think the very fact that Singapore is boring is what makes is so amazing and is in fact one of its greatest strengths. I say this because many of my Swiss friends do not understand why so many foreigners to Switzerland get dumbfounded by its beauty. I guess this is because they're so used to it that they take it for granted and they get used to it. That's why I love how relatively bland Singapore is to other countries because by this I can have a greater appreciation of the beauty of mother nature in other countries.. This is simple! Some people like new experiences. It's boring because they've been here 10 20 years. They'll say the same if they stay the same period anywhere. I know because I am like that too.. Singaporean here, I think I'm probably a siaolang too. 

I find Singapore to be pretty damn awesome, and fun to live in. On the superficial front yes Singapore has a beautiful skyline, loads of tourist attractions and amazing food. But we are a city that is culturally and intellectually poor and I don't mean in terms of our multiculturism or our high education standards. 

I don't feel that we are a nation that promotes progressive thoughts as this is still largely a conservative nation. To put it bluntly most Singaporeans aren't ""woke"" compared to nations with hundreds of years of history and a strong alt left representation like the west. I know I sound like I'm over generalising but if you know what I'm referring to then you know lah. ;). Those who want to go overseas to study because ""Singapore is boring"" probably never lived outside Singapore for extended periods of time. Singapore is a densely populated country with lots of activities and events all year round. Unlike other countries which are larger than Singapore and probably less densely populated, any place of residence other than their cities is likely to be boring.   


Try studying in Tasmania, Australia for 4 years. Basically what some chaps did was to buy a boat / yacht and sail on weekends. Laze on the deck and pluck out oysters from the sea to eat. That's probably the most exciting thing there.   


Or say studying in Warwick... Never been there but I heard it can be quite boring. In the smaller towns there is really nothing much to do. Some did mention that the Christmas market or farmer's market is exciting, and that's because there is pretty much NOTHING for the locals to do until that once a month market. So obviously most in town will turn up to attend the farmer's market. The change of season is horrible is well. Winter sucks. Getting hungry at 3pm because the sky turns dark is horrible. Wearing shit tons of clothing and hiding under your blanket because your house has poor insulation and you want to save money on heating. Semi dying of hunger because you are hungry at night and realize you cannot just walk out to go to your favourite kopitiam to buy food. When there is a snow storm and there are layers of snow and you are hungry and needs to go Tesco or Sainsbury to buy your groceries and you have no choice but to trudge through the damn snow, buy all your food and haul them back like some refugee stocking up for war because you are not stepping out of your house in the next 2 weeks.   


For those who are studying overseas, they fly back to Singapore as much as they can in order to play because Singapore has their friends and there are frankly more places to eat, hangout and play. There are more ""house parties"" overseas because there are no proper clubs or bars in the 10 mile radius and you have no choice but to host your own little drinking session.. They probably don't go out enough. I find singapore just fine, not boring.

The only turn off in sg is financial imo. Other than tht singapore is nice. There is plenty to do here, its just one of the excuses they come up with to justify why they want to move.

But, let them go, they have set their hearts somewhere else and will never be truly happy.. Because people are comparing cities to countries.. It's either 1 of 3 things

1)Grass greener on the other side - They haven't actually live on the other side and make a lot of false assumption base of limited impression

&#x200B;

2)Size - As a city, we are really up there with most major cities around the world but apart we are too small to other things that bigger countries can offer. Nature being the most obvious, we simply do not have enough space for too much green. The other being more niche stuff where a country with a bigger population can support more niche industry, we simply do not have the numbers to be able to support more outlandish stuff

&#x200B;

3)Taking things for granted - U live here for too long and takes things for granted. I used to do that until I started traveling for work. Try staying in India for a freaking month and U will appreciate all things Singapore. Ok what. We got uniqlo dota and anime here. Why boring? Even got prostitutes and ktv. Fun.. Basically, going overseas to live or study IS a waste of time and money because you have to spend thousands on a normal flight, not to mention student loans or school fees for studying abroad and other stuff for settlement. Plus, it'll waste precious time if you are taking a few transit flights. Like if you were to ask me which university I'll rather go to, I'll just go to NUS or furthest the Universiti Kuala Lumpur, because it's like Malaysia.

Also don't forget if you did not buy return flight ticket, you have to pay again.. We just want to see more real nature.. Same reason why many woman attracted to foreigner, in the end size matter

Joke aside, there so much you can do in limited space before find it boring. More space, more thing to do, more culture to explore, more experience to find.. Boring people are boring any place they are.. more often than not it‚Äôs because the people they surround themselves with are boring.. I never understood how people can say Singapore is boring. There are so many places to eat, drink. All types of cuisine. So many parks to explore. Tons of cool neighborhoods to check out. Everything is easily accessible. It is safe, clean.
And if you want a change of pace, so many places you can fly to in 2 hours for a cheap getaway.. Cuz there is no freedom of speech (an American said so). People who say boring don't go out but stay at home scrolling at ""greener"" view. They also the people who complain travelling from Jurong to Pasir Ris is far.. Hahaha. Wanna move out and study overseas? I sure hope your friends are high SES or on scholarship because it ain‚Äôt cheap studying overseas. 

Maybe they can try out the student exchange program in the local AUs if they want the experience of a semester abroad. Otherwise for working and middle class HDB dwelling folks, financially, it just isn‚Äôt worth it.... Only boring people get bored. A city can't be boring per se. Your thread is a nonsense.. I feel its because sg doesn't have other seasons, like autumn etc while other countries have. It makes life more interesting.. Something I noticed about our parks are that they lack life, i.e. little animals. One thing I love about Australian Parks are the ducks inhabiting it, really makes the area more lovely and ""naturey"".. Singapore has something different flowering every two weeks all year round though.. Sadly, it's just not an easy thing to move overseas. Sacrifices have to be made, friends and family left behind, or maybe all you can get is an undesirable role (if any at all). So you're stuck here anyway.. On the other hand, SG absolutely kills its when it comes to the easy accessibility of wildlife to a city. We have coral reefs, rainforest and mangroves within half an hour from CBD. Otters, hornbills, pythons, monitor lizards stalk the city, while owls, civets, monkeys and wild boar roam the suburbs. We have > 50 species of snake to the UK's 3, sea turtles nest on East Coast Park, while even on the mainland sea stars are super common if you know where to look. There's a thriving community of wildlife photographers in SG, and people have been known to fly all the way here from Japan, Korea, and the West just for birdwatching.

EDIT: and the crocodiles, how could I forget the crocodiles. Go to Sungei Buloh at the right tide and you're basically guaranteed to see them.. >Besides that, living anywhere for decades of your life can make it boring.

Yes, that applies to me!. This is very true. When I was into nature and architecture photography years ago, Singapore lose out a lot in these categories compared to our neighbouring countries.. Second this, I mean singapore is like brand new top notch, everything is well planned and convinient. But in few days this goes convenience goes away, and after slogging 9 hours for entire week, you come to realization that there is no where to go off the road, most of the stuff looks artificial.. But all of SEA is accessible in 1-2 hour plane ride.

I live in Switzerland now, and anywhere you live becomes baseline after a few months and the grandeur fades in favor of more important things like living standards.

The mountains still take me 2 hours to reach.. I really don‚Äôt understand this argument. 
You can take a trip to any nearby nature rich country just as easily as you would go to mountains in Europe. 
The fact that it‚Äôs not inside the country is just a formality.. 70% voted for this 

/s. Yes. I love trekking. But not in this weather. Even the same forest have four different sceneries sure to the 4 seasons.. Don't even need to look far compare Singapore to Bangkok. To be fair, I don't think there's a perfect city anywhere. Otherwise it'd be overrun by everyone who wants to live in a perfect city. Then it's no longer perfect.. if you're looking for local music gigs & stuff, check out this app/insta page called gigfindr!

it's a platform where lots of local music organisers list their gigs, & u can browse thru them based on location

imo singapore doesn't lack musical attractions(there's ""underground"" gigs every weekend, but it's very scene-based & most people don't know about them), it just lacks a substantial audience (most gig organisers barely break even) & a proper platform that's widely known & accessible. but! i think that gigfindr might fill in that role of a platform so im feeling optimistic about that :). I think you are correct. The culinary side is good but it is not better than the major western cities but better than the average I think. Produce quality is low in singapore but the influences are great. >The winter

Totally man I‚Äôd head out early to just get to the high country for some snowy action or just head down to Geelong or even further out if I‚Äôm feeling like it. Heaps of things to do Otherwise I‚Äôd hang out with mates to get a kebab on a normal Friday night.  

But it has it‚Äôs novelty but I reckon it‚Äôll take long before it wears out.. Well, we do have Snowcity. /s. Moved from sg to Melbourne. Literally the only thing I dislike about Melbourne is the winters. Its so cold and biting you can't do anything. Even walking to your car is too cold. Plus the sun sets so early, its so depressing and gloomy. I'd rather have sg weather than winter any day. All other seasons are really g tho. Its the humidity in sg that makes it so bad, so a 40 degree day in Melbourne is still better than any day in sg. I love knocking off at 5, heading to the beach in 35 degree weather, having a soak, then a dinner and beer, and sun sets at 9pm. It's great.. Melbourne is fking awesome. I went a few months ago and can't wait for my next trip.. I hate the ass scorching summers in oz 
Especially in Brisbane 
My air conditioner blew up trying to cool my room. I was just about to say. ""I mean... have you been to Australia?"" üòÇ. > Also the nightlife is boring in my opinion. Overpriced drinks. Outside the centre the bars don't have character and they shut early, forcing you to go to the city center.

Can relate to this, hard to meet people when venues nightlife meetups are relegated to clubs and bars where drinks are expensive. Not a problem for high earners but average income earners(like me) will give pause.. Actually different HDB estates have their differences, if you take the time to explore and appreciate them. Different architectural and urban planning philosophies based on the time period. Malls and shops are getting homogenised though due to successful chains getting richer and better able to afford rental costs. For nightlife, if you go beyond alcohol, there are supper places that open late.. If you think hdb blocks are boring you should take a drive along the endless stretches of houses in the suburbs of outer Melbourne. At least there are kopitiams under hdbs.. >No country, Singapore included, will openly advertise their bad points to the global audience.

But we already know about the fines and canings.. I agree with this sentiment. I have lived in Switzerland for a year and half - it's indeed beautiful, the cooler seasons are lovely and there's always something happening somewhere during the weekends. But the working culture, simmering racial biasness, and the untold rules and restrictions are stuff that people don't see on the surface. I was so glad to get posted back, and appreciate my home much more than ever now.

The weird rules and regulations can get a whole story by itself already üòÇ.. Everytime i hear about your hometown, i imagined a small tightly knit community, enjoying their time exploring the places they had already been , and happily exercising around as their past time.

Edit: I was thinking of Hamsterdam. Switzerland is one of my dream place to live and work, if not for the language barrier... do you speak German? Or how did you get a work opportunity there?. It's very fun to read your answer : I'm Swiss and living I  Switzerland (around Lausanne), and actually have a work opportunity to go to Singapore for one year or two with my wife! We are wondering if we should go =) we lived there already for 6 months in 2015.. funnily enough, the singaporeans in california are not particularly outdoorsy. If I were to say something like this as a local pretty sure I would have been downvoted and to go ""have a life"" or ""find something to do"". Better let a foreigner state the truth from their perspective. Sg life is just stale af. There are those who try to stand out and be unique by taking up some weird and cool sports/hobby, but they end up being call show offs or nerds.. > Also music, film and just living variety in general is very low, and people are quite similar in thinking and their way of behaving.

Don't want to trivialize your experience here, but this is very indicative of living within a certain bubble, and not expanding your social circle. 

Foreigner here, and it took me years before my critique of Singapore as ""sterile"" turned out to be a fault of me staying within the expat bubble and looking through that lens. There is a lack of nature and countryside which makes a lot of people uncomfortable, but it's also unfair on our part to draw comparisons between Singapore and other bigger countries. Small country dynamics are extremely different from big country dynamics.

Once again, we're all entitled to our beliefs. But let's also think about what we really mean when we say ""sterile"" - is it the nature of the country and its culture, or is it case of not managing expectations?. >one big city

try Kranji Marshes, Sungei Buloh mangroves, Macritchie Nature Reserve, anywhere that isn't neatly curated like Botanic Gardens. There are still pythons, crocodiles, sambar deer and pangolins in Singapore, just a matter of luck.. >people are quite similar in thinking and their way of behaving

If you ask foreigners living in your home country, they will probably tell you the same. Our behaviour is programmed by the society, but it's much easier to see the patterns and think ""everyone is the same"" if you come from a different culture.. Exactly! If anyone has lived (not toured) in other parts of the world they‚Äôre better at judging, than any local who‚Äôs bound to find this view objectionable and dismissive. Like it or not but, the routine lifestyle here definitely drives one to chronic boredom.. have you not been to sungei buloh or bukit timah nature reserve? you‚Äôll be shocked at how raw and wild it is. it‚Äôs a full blown jungle. the botanical gardens are nice but it‚Äôs not a forest.. What sort of music and films do you want? There are several film and music festivals every year.  
And there are plenty of places to experience nature away from the botanical gardens. > tldr would be, there's a reason why tourists come to Singapore just for food and shopping and are recommended to stay just a few days as that's all it'll take.

This answers OP's question completely.. Just seems that everyone works and just goes home as they can‚Äôt stand to see their colleagues for another hour.

Worked in a few countries where it‚Äôs the norm to grab dinner and drinks with your colleagues.. The point about a lack of human relationships and appreciation struck a chord with me. I never really enjoyed (large) events here, and that's probably a reason why. Natsumatsuri is an exception (haven't been to the newer one at the national stadium though), probably because it was organized by the Japanese School rather than having the 'government stamp' that you speak of.  It felt a lot more organic.

I get the feeling that Singaporeans in general don't treasure a sense of community to their surroundings, or want to put in the effort to nurture it.. To connect this sense of life with the comment on how Singapore is sterile and clean while Japan is clean without having to be sterile:

In South Korea, I've seen a man on the street working on his brush calligraphy on his fan. This really connects an ancient art with the country's culture, bringing both the art form and culture to life. I think Singapore controls its busking laws so only buskers of a 'certain presentation' are permitted? (Pls correct me if I'm wrong) Anyhow, even if it's not street life, the permitted presentations of a Singaporean culture in Singapore are also archaic, tokenistic and driven top-down; they don't bear any meaning for us, and we become disengaged with our very own culture.

In South Korea, I've seen bold interpretations of their traditions and culture, and the place feels throbbing with life. Some examples:

\- The language-less performances mixing comedy and Korean cooking/taekwando/Korean modern and traditional music/breakdancing/drawing.

\- The modern interpretation of the hanbok, resulting in both tourists and locals running around Korean cities in hanbok, simulating scenes from Goryeo and beyond --- This is a very new innovation that has only emerged less than 10 years ago. When you wear a hanbok, you get free entry to the palace -- what a wonderful way for the hanbok makers to make a comeback, for local economy to thrive, and to differentiate Korea from other countries.

\- Local takewando groups doing performances just to share the art and to invite participants

Note these are just the completely apolitical places/activities. From these, you can see how the locals live, what they thrive on, the new occupations they can take up, the local economic activities, their history and culture.

On the other hand - take Kampong Glam for example - besides the rehashed narrative about it being the place for Malay, Bugis and Arab communities (and mind you, that narrative would neccessarily mean giving thanks to our coloniser Raffles) - so what about it? It's been the same substantially for the 40 years I've been alive. Eateries, clothing boutiques, some museum, a mosque. If you've been there once, there's really no reason to go back. (I did attend a small festival and haven't been there for a long time, so pls correct me if I'm wrong). Same for many places in Singapore. It's really hard for a person to spend 10 yrs, let alone their entire lives, in a place that remains stagnant in essence. I can visit London 10 times a year for 10 years - this is the kind of place that wouldn't be classified by their residents as 'boring' or 'sterile'.

In many countries I've been to, while there are pockets of expensive dining/shopping areas, there are streets that mix both fine dining/shopping with cheaper ones. I find the segregation much more acute in Singapore (e.g. Dempsey, Clarke Quay versus Kampong Glam, Chinatown ). The mix of crowds then becomes very homogeneous, and the experience is flat, dead.

The sense of what life can be, what Singapore can be, who Singaporeans can be is severely absent. Add to that, the people are constantly getting undermined (Singaporeans are ugly, they don't deserve nice things, their English is bad, their Chinese is bad, they are complainers) and that the boldest of our dreams is to have Jewel shopping mall, it really feels like Singapore is nothing but a hollow shell lacking meaning for its meaningless people. 

Maybe the issue is not that Singapore feels boring -- but that it feels empty.. can i borrow ur comment to answer all the aunties who tsk at me for wanting to study overseas. someone finally put it in words:""). I feel this. Everything‚Äôs kinda built to a theme. When I took my friend sight seeing, I noticed that everywhere looks harmonious, homogeneous, you can tell from the architecture that there is very little competing egos, because like you mentioned, creativity (not really bring encouraged) and ‚Äúgovernment stamp‚Äù. 

We‚Äôre coddled/nannied which can make a culture kinda clinical. Everything‚Äôs ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù. 
There‚Äôs much more ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù vibes in larger cities. 

It‚Äôs also harder to have fun when the whole nation is pretty much reigned in by the government. It‚Äôs like when you have a traditionally Asian parent who wants you home by 11pm every night. Doesn‚Äôt let you stay overnight at chalets. Doesn‚Äôt let you learn to skate because dangerous. Gets annoyed if you treat the house like a place to sleep. I mean it‚Äôs not like the stuff you want to do is illegal or cause harm, but still some parents are like that. So similarly I‚Äôm not saying to have fun in Singapore is necessarily to do things against the law, but the governance and surveillance and implicit management all go towards creating that nagging sense of oppression that you can‚Äôt do anything you‚Äôd find fun.. I didn't know I felt this way until you expressed it so succinctly in words.

Honestly, as a non-profit worker trying to build ties with the community to get them involved in our cause, it's hard to come up with something that will get others to come, thanks to government regulations.. I don't know man, I've tried living overseas in a suburb that has access to woods and everything for 4 months. The novelty wore off after awhile because it was so quiet and sometimes silence can make you feel very lonely. I never thought of myself as a city person until I took a road trip out to a major city and I never got so excited to see skyscrapers. It was a weird feeling, like you got out of the country and chose a quiet place to be away from the concrete buildings but there is a sense of comfort when you see one. Thankfully Singapore is pretty accessible to neighbouring countries like Malaysia, Indonesia that offers a lot more nature and land if you ever feel the need to escape the urban jungle.

Edit: grammar. > The air in Singapore smells awful 

for real meh? (dont count haze obviously) i always preferred singapore air, and feel proud of our air :( 

the nicest i have been to is japan, where the air feels better. but i always factor that to lower humidity. even in city like osaka or tokyo, their air dont smell good, near river/water bodies just stink bad. 

care to share where got the good fresh air you enjoyed?. As much as we call ourselves a garden city, only when I trekked in a national park, did I really really know how green is ‚Äúgreen‚Äù. 

Also, quiet is REALLY quiet in other countries. I did a homestay once in Australia at one of the smaller towns. And at night, you can hear the pin drop. It was so peaceful I sat there for hours on the porch. The Aussie family I was with probably thought I was some siao lang.. agree. one of my biggest fantasies is to own a huge field and just explore it everyday, or stroll the empty beaches and cliffsides. closest thing i can get to that here is sitting on dog shit filled grass near my block. not nice.. Seconded for events. 

Would like to add a sub-point for that. 

I‚Äôm quite a trance fan so I‚Äôve travelled quite extensively for trance festivals. 

In other countries, it really is a big party. Everyone welcomes each other and are genuinely looking to have a good time. 

Prices are decent. People generally look out for each other. 

In Singapore though, the minute you lay eyes on a girl, you‚Äôre immediately a pervert lol. Prices here are crazy as well. People generally want to stick to their friends who they went with.. Pretty true. It's why Singaporeans who can afford it travel so much.. we might be lacking in megafauna but i can assure you the CCNR and our other nature reserves are teeming with animals, and I don't mean monkeys squirrels and Calotes lizards. You just need to walk with someone who knows what they're doing.. Hey there, you raised some great points.

Question: how can a place be clean and not sterile? I don't really get that part. 

I would like to know how Singapore is clean and sterile while Japan is simply clean.

Thanks in advance!. A boar. i hate the new white led lamps, makes everywhere feel even more sterile and is too bright for night time as well, increases the light pollution we are exposed to imo. But yeah you might be right. Still, I explore with close friends so there is a lot of cock to talk ahaha. Don't talk to me about Singapore being boring until you visited the many wonders of Singapore such as:

&#x200B;

le *ch√¢teau de Capitaland* situated in the heart of the city. It was a monument to evolving technologies of Singapore, which unfortunately fell victim to abandonment in the early 20th century. Us locals affectionally called it Funan.  


Or how about the engineering marvel that is the *Capitaland a la Ion* that is built right in the heart of Orchard Road, boosting nearly 1mi square feet of tai tai therapy. Such a monument.

&#x200B;

Too comtemporary for your taste? How about the classic  *Cath√©drale Capitaland de la Tampines Mall*, where one can remember seeing the first ever Harry Potter movie after class, stone throw away from the pretigious Temasek Polytechnic where famed Singapore and Asian Idol, Hady Mirza read Mechatronics in the Engineering wing.. That‚Äôs all there is. Amen. I miss being able to eat good and affordable beef. Coming from LA where there is affordable and high quality AYCE KBBQ and affordable steaks from Costco, living in Singapore has been rough. The beef here doesn‚Äôt taste the same. People tell me it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs from a different type of cow. 

Singapore is small man. I‚Äôve been here a year and I feel like I‚Äôm getting cabin fever.  Everything it‚Äôs engineered by the govt and that makes it all feel forced and sterile. 

If I was rich it would be more fun because I could eat what I wanted and do whatever I wanted, and just fly to another country when it got old - but that is true wherever you live in the world!. Well, at least it's not boring.....the first time. No lah it‚Äôs just the entrance. The rest of the compound is fenced up anyways. >For me, I enjoy hiking mountains and rock climbing. The only options in SG are either Bukit timah Hill or rock climbing gyms.

I went to Bukit Timah hill for the first time in many years. That place is a clusterfuck now. Crowded as hell on the weekend. The carparks are all full and people everywhere. That's just an average weekend. I decided never to step foot in there again. I don't see the appeal of going to a nature reserve full of people.. Thank you for supporting the Singaporean board game industry üëçüèª. You know you're really grasping at straws when your highlights of Singapore are listening to someone sing in a living room üòÇ. >I miss nature getaways but flights are cheap and quick, so nothing prevents you from going to the nearby countries.

In regards to this point, then you're not exactly 'living' in the place if you're constantly escaping elsewhere isn't it?   


Alot of expats had told me Singapore is great for the flight connections and cheap flights to bali etc.. Great points.. Can confirm, I live in TB and can hear drunk men shouting at 2am.. >Australia fkn boring.

You are literally in the best place for car culture.

Buy a used commodore and make It the most dopest shit that the SG govt wouldnt allow. Welll we are not Storm from the Xmen so


Oooof. yeah ppl just think that bc we don't have tigers singapore has no nature, then you show them a Wagler's Pitviper and they go ""wtf that's from Singapore?"". I think money is also a limiting factor.. Outside the gate lol. Normally i just wave at the guy on guard duty and they are happy enough to smile. Did they shut the trail from treetop walk to bukit timah already? I did that maybe 1 year ago.... clearly you haven‚Äôt seen the video of the crazy auntie rushing in the mrt and getting caught in the doors. or you haven‚Äôt read the video of the auntie that smeared her shit all over the neighbour‚Äôs laundry.. Well i am a local and i did go back to lim chu kang to see the (almost gone) village my dad used to live in. His old primary school is still there iirc, but it is now part of the SAF‚Äôs FIBUA training ground. His farmhouse is probably gone but last time we went to see it it was still standing atop a hill surrounded by nature. Sadly, that place is also fenced up in Sungei Gedong.. You did your degree in UIUC or Purdue lol.

But yes, you've hit everything I felt about the midwest in one post. I swear to god I've never wanted to return home this bad.. yeah and we don't even have the option for a track day here. Or their Steam library with nothing to play lol. Hi there. Where did you move to and why? Care to explain a bit more? Cheers!. The average working-class person in another country has all these obligations too.

I dunno leh. I feel like people in other countries just prioritise more fun (for lack of a better word) things to do in their free time? There's a comment by someone else saying that ""everyone wants to do the tested and proven way, nobody wants to try something new, it's all about keeping your head down and not disturbing the flow."" and I feel that's pretty accurate.. >A place is only as boring as the person saying it's boring.

Eh. If you constantly need to make a place interesting then well... Says something about that place.. ""a place is only as boring as the person saying its boring"" is such a dumb statement. Using that logic, there are no boring places and that even prison is not boring. Its all about relatively. Singapore is not boring... But its potentially boring compared to typical uni destinations like the UK, when you can always drive out of cities to the countryside when you want some fresh air and beautiful scenery. Central business district. I am local haha. But i love computer games.

Not that Singapore is as amazing as the places depicted in GTA (which often highlight very dark themes of struggle and criminal behaviour). But in terms of gameplay, i find the map to be very nostalgic because of its small size. Once you‚Äôve played enough, you feel that the map is like home. In contrast, you have the map of minecraft, which has breathtaking views but really has nothing memorable about the physical locations itself (as it is procedurally generated).. not like we can type:


Hesoyam


And win at life right?. You can't compare a global city like Singapore to Tasmania or Warwick. This thread is talking more about livability and when you're a student you mainly choose a city based on the institution that's based there. 

Compare it to HK, Bangkok, London, Tokyo, New York or LA lah. I am going through what you described but I still find it infinitely more interesting than singapore. Experiencing seasons is one of the best things about living overseas. Il take suffering in a blizzard with friends over hot chocolate and baileys over suffering in perpetual heat in sg anyday. Need money lor. Me: ""Uniqlo Dota? There is a Uniqlo themed Dota???.....oh right, the phrase just lacks a comma. My bad"".. A lot of places in Europe offer free or very cheap education, much cheaper than in Singapore. Some like in Hungary even offer a very easy stipend of 1,000 Euros to help you. Granted it's not a lot, but it's Hungary, and basically the requirements for that aren't a lot. A lot of overseas universities have their students working for their professors part time as well. 

Studying overseas isn't always in the UK or US. Some places like these are more expensive to study in than in Singapore, whereas some places are free (Germany, Czech Republic) or way cheaper.. For sure. Fairs and events that follow the seasons just doesnt feel the same in singapore. For eg, a christmas market in london just feels more festive than a christmas market in singapore. Seasons give both retailers and shoppers a reason to celebrate/shop. We have the four seasons: salt, pepper, sugar and Kaya.. Or any variation in geography relative to other countries - its just not big enough. This it's basically like having 4 different countries in the same area every year! I quite like SG too but I wish it had 4 seasons. I want to move to Singapore because I'm sick of having four seasons. I dont think so because miami dosent have seasons either and many other places laying close to the tropic line where season are not a thing yet they are more interesting than Singapore. We have Wild Otters around, Squirrels, Monkeys if that are what you are talking about. Hell yeah, Wild deers and Wild boars at Mandai Area if are adventurous enough ;). We have tribes of quail in Bukit Batok Nature Reserve. Just gotta spend more time around is all.. I have to disagree....given our limited..we do have a lot....

aside from the wild boars and otters, there colugos, pangolins, mouse deers, sambar deers, macaques, banded langurs, crocodiles...lots of different raptors....a whole long list la...

i find that the it's because there are so many people in the parks, that you won't see them...

just gotta be quiet and patient.. I find our parks simply too 'manicured'   


Like I enjoyed the parks overseas more because they don't trim very plant neatly. Sometimes its nice when its all overgrown and shit.   


Kew gardens > Botanical gardens. Their glasshouse has all these overgrown palm trees.. sorry. noticed you mentioned small animals.....in this regard...ok la..i agree...can only think of squirrels and lizards. Got mynah and koel mah. Even coffee shops also have.. I didnt know the caning was done once every 2 weeks. Outsourced the one dealing the punishment i guess?. Yeah and racism is a issue too. diving in Singapore is actually dangerous. In any other place, 5m visibility is considered bad. In Singapore, 50cm visibility is considered excellent. Diving in sg is like diving in soup, so much pollution and sediment. The only other place nearly as bad is Penang, which is at least 1-5m visibility. I do not recommend diving to see the coral reefs in Singapore at all.. It wasn't an argument, and neither is your ""argument"" any more understandable. I simply stated my personal reason for thinking why SG is boring. Your reasoning can be literally applied to anybody who is bored in any country. Bored of living in a small town surrounded by forest? Well, take a trip to any big cities! Absolutely redundant statement.

IMO, being bored is a matter of perspective and our own preferences, there is no country that is able to make every single citizen feel excited all the time.. You could compare it to KL, hell. KL isn't really my favorite place to be, but it's got more affordable things to do than Singapore and lots of daytrip options.. Case in point: Singapore.. I'm quite biased but I think Tokyo is about as good as a big city can get, and indeed the population keeps increasing. I feel like it's one of the very few places where a high population density doesn't feel overwhelming because people agree to abide by certain social norms.. Where you can make more money!. Yeah yeh winter can be brutal. But I love it. Haha

Then again, you only have to put up with it for a while. Tropical climate is just never ending hot or hotter. 

And yeah people here look at the temps in Melbourne during summer but it‚Äôs rarely so humid like SG. I handle the heat better in Melbourne.. Well, the government don't see those as bad points.. I was lucky! The internship I managed to get into had a partnership with NTU and they were looking for interns. I applied and got in.

I did not speak German prior, but had to take German lessons there, so now Ich sprech ein bisschen Deutsch.

It's true that language integration is an important criteria to work in Switzerland, but all their national languages are Romance languages or Germanic, which mean they are not as difficult to pick up for English speakers as compared to say, Russian or Chinese or Vietnamese.

Other than that, all I can say is it's definitely difficult to get a job there from a non EU country. I've tried briefly. Although there are some job openings there that do not require them to look within Switzerland and then the EU, these jobs are typically pretty hard to get in, like some World Bank subsidiaries or other international organizations/research facilities. If you're really keen on it though, studying there to transit into a professional helps!. Bonsoir monsieur et merci! If you have a chance, you should definitely try living here, of course, if you liked your previous stay. I met a lot of Europeans whom were very impressed with and loved Singapore! It‚Äôs a small but very well connected city, which is probably attractive to people who live in smaller towns or places with no skyscrapers. 

It‚Äôs always such an interesting topic to think about when I would love to live in their countries and they in mine. I think the very good thing about Singapore is convenience - shops don‚Äôt close at 6pm nor on Sundays which were very annoying living in a Swiss German town. Cheap and very accessible food (McDelivery, am I right?!) also were a huge attraction (although it‚Äôs way unhealthier than home cooked). I mean of course there‚Äôs the clean streets, general safety, cosmopolitan and multicultural society and also general political stability, but I guess that‚Äôs similar to CH as well. :p. >There are those who try to stand out and be unique by taking up some weird and cool sports/hobby, but they end up being call show offs or nerds.

Agreed.

I'm a replica gun maker and I often get called weird for my hobby.

Like wtf.. >  they end up being call show offs or nerds.

""Ah boy/ah girl, don't see this x-games/e-sports/musical lah. These people nothing better to do and never study in school, that's why have to do this kind of nonsense thing. You just study hard and be doctor/banker/lawyer/minister/richest person in the world can liao"". That's the point, it's a small country and has small country dynamics. If you manage your expectations you can have a good life in Alaska or something, but that's not really what we're discussing here.. >
Don't want to trivialize your experience here, but this is very indicative of living within a certain bubble, and not expanding your social circle.

I don't think so, I actually agree with him. I'm British but have plenty of local friends due to being born here and having come back to serve NS.. I'm quite an outdoors person. All these places go until sian already. Singapore really not much to see. Not complaining or anything but that's the fact. We are a small country and everything is limited.. Sama Sama.. ü§£ Hilarious. By virtue of our relatively small population also, you are not going to see many big events here. 

Music and film 'festivals' are subject to approval by the authorities, so what we get here is more limited compared to other more liberal countries. Just look at the cancellation of the metal gig recently. 

And if you're content with just a stroll in a park or down East Coast Park, then sure, Singapore has some bits of nature. When you want a full day mountain hike, or a multi-day hike in a nature park, where are you going to go? Making loops around Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is not the same.. Totally agree with this point!!! 

First I thought may be I am new and not so close so they not inviting me and must be going among themselves.. but after few years now I realise they never go amongst themselves ( I mean local colleagues). oh man, that‚Äôs exactly how i felt too when i went to sweden for exchange. granted, i went to a small university town and so everything felt quite close knitted but there was definitely a sense of community and people cared! they regularly picked up after themselves, cared abt environmental conservation, sex education etc etc. in contrast, singaporeans appear to be more stuck in their bubble and more detached from the community although it seems more like a byproduct of socialization. I'm not a fan of large events too and there isn't that human dimension, sense of relationality at such events.

Why do you think the reason is the lack of demand (""Singaporeans don't treasure"") - as compared to the lack of supply?. It's your sentiment after all! :). Could you elaborate on the obstacles? I have friends who have organised small-scale events - sporadically and very infrequently. There is some kind of attendance at them... Grass is always greener on the other side. Well I think that if we have to say ""go Malaysia"" when people want to experience nature, then that just shows something that singapore lacks.. IMHO, Singapore is lacking a balance on that front (due to small size), in most other countries you are always free to go to the countryside or somewhere quiet if you feel like you need it and then return to the city life again when you're up for it. There's no such choice here, everywhere you go it's either the same deal or just filled with lots of people and noise. The monotony builds up.. To each his own I guess, for some people being alone and surrounded by nature is an overwhelming experience. For introverts like me, hell is other people. Freshest of airs: American national parks, New Zealand mountains, Australian northen territory. speaking of japan, whenever i go there, the air has _this_ distinct smell which i can't describe. the smell is not awful but it is something, not-flowery sweet.. Even without haze, Singapore's typical AQI is about 50. That's not very good compared to cities in Europe/Australia. Tokyo is often better as well despite being a gigacity.. Mountain air is fantastic. It is so cold and fresh in the mornings.. Wa I really hated the air in Singapore leh. It's because everytime I travel to work or school, walking and waiting at bus stops will surely make me inhale all the fumes. Also a lot of pedestradian walk ways are very close to the roads so for me I think the air in Singapore is seriously bad. Unless I go more ulu places then it's different case.. Rural Qld, wake up smell the wet grass and chilled air...real country goodness. I think that the idea of ""nature"" is pretty big, and isn't just limited to ""wild animals"". Climbing mountains etc... are all bits of nature that Singapore does not have.. Singapore is not beautiful. For whatever cultural or historic reason. Everything about Japan is beautiful. You can just see centuries of thoughtfulness, respect, purpose, pride in everything they build and do.

Singapore is clean, modern, but it‚Äôs not pretty. I mean sterile in the sense that it‚Äôs lacking in imagination. Like a hospital. A hospital is clean but it serves its function.. Apa siak. Lmfao. LOL. Take your silver. Whoosh. tbh most people don't really care if you enter those training areas like Lor Asrama or the ones in lim chu kang. We never reported or anything even when we saw non-SAF ppl in those areas looking for durians or some shit. Yeah, problem is so bad sometimes that I have to detour and go to the Hindhede section only. Thankfully fewer people go there. Sometimes I go during school hols on weekdays, park is almost empty. Those are the times when most of the animals come out from hiding also.. Well its the tallest hill without traveling outside so.... This is exactly the kind of attitude I mean. If you deride everything of course nothing will be good enough for you.. > In regards to this point, then you're not exactly 'living' in the place if you're constantly escaping elsewhere isn't it?

I mean it applies to any place that has nature around. It‚Äôs not like you have mountains and lakes in your city center and just go there by mrt.. I got a Toyota Supra myself. Precisely! By the way youve got some pretty dope shots of the waglers and mangrove pit hahaha. I posted some pictures of a few waglers I had found at Bukit Timah hill on reddit too! I havent had the time to go to Pasir Ris mangroves/ Sungei Buloh in a long while to go find more mangrove pit vipers though... May I ask what camera you use?. Or rather; the willingness to spend is the limiting factor. Yeah, I think money segregates and limits interaction with other people here.. Like that fun meh. It's connected via rifle range road. Not sure what the OP is talking about because I run from MCR to BT every week, and it's definitely connected. Technically it's on asphalt but that stretch of road is only about 2km before you hit the forest again.. No that's still there and that's not the one I'm talking about. Further north. I said there used to be a hiking trail that you could get to from Upper Thompson Road and from Upper Seletar Reservoir Park. It was a delightfully wild trek along the water with very little in the way of amenities but lots of nice scenery and wild encounters. The trail connected to the Chestnut Nature Park (the one with the mountain bike trails) near Bukit Timah. I last walked the trail in ~2013. Today it's fenced off completely with [scary warning signs.]( Why not both? Fml, I was in one for undergrad and now in the other for PhD.. Having one of the best internet connections in the region helps too, with surprisingly decent connection to US W and EU. The notoriety of the region is well earned though.. I moved to Texas for graduate school. I've always felt like the US was where I would fit in best so I went. I've been here for the last 4.5 years and am hoping to stay. I miss home and my family but I've been much happier here. Back home I always felt too outgoing, too loud, too big, too liberal. I never fit it with what was expected of me. And here I feel like I can be me.. Ya but who‚Äôs to say they‚Äôre not sick and tired of their lives as well? 

I won‚Äôt be so quick to generalize folks from other countries - I studied in the US and am working in New York, and the daily struggle is real. Even the most interesting city can seem like a drag if that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre doing your daily grind.. i don't think any place is obligated to make itself 'interesting' for any community.

Do you serious expect 'interesting' things and events to drop by your plate without you even at least try to do something?

Nobody is obligated to make things 'interesting' for anyone (tourism notwithstanding because that got to do with money and yes, we are obligated to make things 'interesting' for the tourists because money. Can't say no to that sweet sweet 'Yusof Ishak'.. > you can always drive out of cities to the countryside when you want some fresh air and beautiful scenery

That is a dumb statement in itself. What you deemed 'exciting' is boring to someone else. A countryside with fresh air and beautiful scenary is gonna be boring for some auntie that just want to do shopping in a mall. Are you gonna tell the auntie that she is 'wrong'? 

Quit your horses.

Also, in your prison example, i'm sorry, did anyone enter prison by their own volition? You want to do #IAmSoSmart, at least come up with a less dumb example.

My point is, if you are not a boring person yourself, then you will always find things to entertain yourself regardless of your location. You want to pin something on your boredom, pin on yourself, not the location.. Actually there are people who can live internally versus people who live externally. Former group ok with sg but latter group not. 

Former group just read book watch tv play game enough for entertainment.. Even in other countries, nothing is free.  Unless you want to go for walks, but you don't need to leave Singapore for that.. Yup true but you also need the funds to support yourself there, to pay for rental and other living expenses. Which is at least 10-20k euros a year. So me Being from a working class/low middle class background which maybe 50-60% of Sg people are, My parents didn‚Äôt have the 40-80k Euros to fund me but if other parents do, then go ahead. 

Also I can‚Äôt believe I was actually downvoted for saying a fact üôÑ. That you either need a scholarship or have parents with the means to pay for your overseas education to do exactly that.. Exactly. The temperature/scenery and environment plays a part in events.. Hey I didn't make this up! It was taught on TV on this documentary called ""Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd"".. Chilli sauce,Tomato Sauce,Curry Sauce & Barbeque Sauce. Durian season! In fact there are 2 durian seasons in a year. Damn I'm craving for some durians now. > We have the four season**ing**s: salt, pepper, sugar and Kaya.


Fixed that for ya. As someone that comes from northern Europe, seasons are overrated. Sure, some spring and autumn days can be quite nice, but those are more an exception than a rule. Autumn is usually a lot of rain that sometimes keeps going for days or even weeks straight without a stop. In winter you often have to walk around in 2-3C and slush that soaks through your shoes and ruin your pants. And don't get me started on the darkness during winter.... I've only seen the wild boars at LCK, but I'm talking more of neighborhood parks. Like those in HDB estates etc. At least people use the parks though, down here in Aus, I barely see anyone in the parks .. Yea, but they're hardly a regular or permanent feature in Singapore parks. Monkeys and squirrels require you to go pretty far out to the nature reserve in BT to get a high chance to glimpse at and they usually run away anyway.

The Hyde Park in Sydney has a regular and near permanent feature of various birds that do not fear or bother people much. And the park itself is in the center of the CBD.. The kind I experience overseas is really implicit but it's more like xenophobia than racism.. There's plenty to see even without diving!  Personally I've seen lots more nudibranch species from intertidal walks in SG than when I dived in Malaysia, though of course I probably wasn't at the best of the best sites. Also, you do get visibility of up to 5-10m when the currents are right at the right time of year. I also have friends that dive regularly at Hantu and other reefs and get loads of fantastic photos of marine life despite the poor visibility.. > I simply stated my personal reason for thinking why SG is boring. 
 
That‚Äôs pretty much a dictionary definition of an argument. 

>Your reasoning can be literally applied to anybody who is bored in any country. Bored of living in a small town surrounded by forest? Well, take a trip to any big cities! Absolutely redundant statement.

Well thats my point - you shouldn‚Äôt compare Singapore to other countries as a whole, because it makes no sense. Comparison should be done on a city by city basis. 

>IMO, being bored is a matter of perspective and our own preferences, there is no country that is able to make every single citizen feel excited all the time.

I don‚Äôt disagree with this, but it has nothing to do with what I said.. KL is okay lah. You really have to dig a little to find it's charms and fun. But I like it that way. Stops these things from becoming tourists traps. KL is dangerous too. You get mugged by people on bikes. I got my bag stolen like that in KL. 

Singapore on the other hand is very safe compared to KL. I wouldn‚Äôt go out at night in KL. MacRitchie, Bukit Timah nature reserve, Southern Ridges, Pulau Ubin, St John Island. > Music and film 'festivals' are subject to approval by the authorities, so what we get here is more limited compared to other more liberal countries. Just look at the cancellation of the metal gig recently.

I think the effect is even worse. Without general acceptance, people will form cliques. Cliques can become insular. This results in everyone just interacting in their own bubbles and not willing to step out and meet other people.. I just think it‚Äôs also because people overseas tend to rent apartments in the city, so they don‚Äôt really have to go home and eat. The whole moving out bit is still prevalent despite rising rental costs. 

So they just hang out after work to grab dinner and drinks. 

Over here, by the time work ends, you‚Äôre rushing home to eat your cold dinner. 

Was a huge culture shock for me too as I was working overseas before coming back. I thought my colleagues hated me lol.. It really depends on the perspective I guess. I don't find this as something that Singapore is lacking. Isn't that a beauty of it where Singapore is that accessible to visit nearby places? In larger countries, you maybe have to drive at least 1hr or more to reach national parks so it's not a deal breaker on my end. The point I was making was that living with nature is a lot different than just experiencing nature and could just be a very idealised thought.. Never mention [fresh Icelandic mountain air]( Pollen from Japanese cedar.. it's shoyu. Could be [this]( It‚Äôs a distinct mould smell. i would like to think i sensitive to the haze/aqi already. but at the typical aqi here, i cannot physically smell any awful smell. even if i came back from an overseas trip. 

which is nice.. I'm not deriding what you enjoy, neither am I whining about Singapore being damn boring. It is what it is, and I think the ""only boring people feel bored"" notion is a really cop out response to the fact that Singapore is a small city that is pretty boring. Look at the other responses in this thread for proof. The novelty of living room concert surely wears off after the first one.. Fml doing my PhD in Purdue. Please tell me you're in Purdue I'm dying to meet a sinkie lol.. I'm just pointing out that some places are less interesting than others. I'm not sure why you seem to be trying to argue with me that places are obliged/not obliged to be interesting.. I don't think we should judge by whether a person is boring but rather what the person deems as boring. Some of my friends are more attuned to city/urban lifestyle and finds Singapore to be perfectly okay. On the flip side, for the rest of us Singapore is lacking in terms of nature and weather. If you're looking to hike up or go camping in the woods, I would assume other countries will be preferable to Sg.. I think the downvotes were because you said that it isn't cheap studying overseas, but the same can be said about studying in local university. The only upside about studying in local university is free accommodation if you want, as I'm pretty sure your parents would not charge you rent, and eating out cheap.

Just curious though, are your opinions based on personal experience or through what you hear/read online? 

I did 6 months of internship in Switzerland, and I would like to say that despite being in a Swiss town, it wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. University-provided accommodation is S$400-500ish a month, which is a good price as I'm charged $375 a month for staying in a non-air conditioned single room in NTU. Food prices were S$50-100 a week. Granted, I have to cook everyday, but that becomes a healthier and tastier option anyways. Other costs that I had was transport - I had to pay I think a S$450-ish for a year of public transport half-fare, some administration fees, and travel fare whenever I travel on the weekends. 

So in other words, for living in a Swiss town, based on my own experience, I survived on about S$500-600 a month, which is similar to that in Singapore. Of course, these costs leave the price of education unfactored, and if you consider the cheaper prices of education at certain European countries, you are actually living on less. And of course, if you factor the fact that Switzerland is one of the most expensive countries in Europe, and the world, you can actually do it significantly cheaper in countries like Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary, Ukraine, etc.

Also, not to mention, Switzerland at least, and perhaps other countries, can have students working ""50% - 80%"" while studying. I was attached to a research facility of an university, and my supervisor had his masters student working 50% of a full time contract, with 50% of full time pay, which is obviously livable.

So yeah, in conclusion, I disagree with your sentiment that studying overseas is for people who are from more well to do families, because I studied in Singapore and still am left with a sizable debt as I took CPF Education Loan. It's just a lot of overhead costs that are taken out of the equation for the time being if you studied in Singapore.. this guy seasons. Salted egg, bubble tea, nasi lemak and cheese. Lame dude. I agree. for most part , I might actually understand why some foreigners would be racist towards us (chinese) people.. Google: "" an exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one. ""

I'm not denying his views. I completely accept that people will find Singapore exciting, just not me. Just because its an opposing view, doesn't mean is automatically an argument. Not everybody is so easily angered as you.

Country or City, it doesn't make a difference. Furthermore, Singapore IS a Country, which makes your second point mute.

Thirdly, you said you don't understand it. My point is that a) It's not an argument and b) the reasoning because its merely an opinion/perspective. I am perfectly alright with people having their own, and heck, they should. 

All these are neutral points, and it baffles me you are able to find fault with it.. I would. Went through all the places like Bukhit Bintang and the Chinese club center no problem. You Singaporeans have it too easy, get angry over first-world problems, so you have no idea how to protect yourself when you visit developing countries. Like Japanese tourists.. It's sad that you think this way. This then limits your travelling experience to so many countries. Hell even the US, supposedly the best country in the world is more dangerous than KL. Not gonna go there?. Have never had any issues with safety anywhere in Malaysia, Thailand, HK, etc.  Obviously stay out of certain neighborhoods, but thats true anywhere.

I am black, so that might be a factor as well.. These are all great parks, but the guy is saying ""When you want a full day mountain hike, or a multi-day hike in a nature park, where are you going to go"". Let me see if this puts a different perspective:

1. Google ""hiking in new york city""
2. Google ""wildlife in new york city""
3. Parks? Here's a wikipedia link: 

So, yes I am being unfair comparing NY To Singapore but different is different.. Maybe nature just isn't a big deal for you, and that's fine.

I've lived overseas in cities that are very well connected to mountains and forests and visited the country side nearly every chance I could, across four seasons. This simply does not exist in Singapore because:

1) You generally need an hour just to drive out of Singapore and over the causeway
2) Peninsula Malaysia has some mountains that are near 2000m but they are all up north. They aren't exactly in Johor.
3) still no seasons

One hour to reach a national park is fantastic, and when it's in the same country, no need to worry about different currencies, passports, waiting times in airports or immigration... And so on.. Pm'd. Okay. Fair enough. But  also the university fees are expensive in the European countries. Im sure there are cheaper universities and even free university education in some countries but the programs done in English aren‚Äôt as extensive. 

But it is still cheaper to study locally. If you‚Äôre doing undergrad 4 yrs in Switzerland vs doing 4 yrs in Singapore, including living costs and rental, I am sure Singapore is still more affordable. You did a 6 mth internship in Switzerland. 

And if normal people living in 4 rm HDB flats can afford 4 years of education in Europe, don‚Äôt you think they would have done it already? The truth is you still need the money minimum, 10k Euro a year which is 40k euros for 4 yrs. And which average Singaporean family has 40k euros cash to spare?. Hello, mala would like a word with you.. Thinking about it, we(Singaporeans) are not exactly accepting to the foreigners in out Country, arguably much more xenophobic than what I've experienced here.. > Google: "" an exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one. ""

Well if you read it further the next line is: ‚Äúa reason or set of reasons given in support of an idea, action or theory.‚Äù

> Not everybody is so easily angered as you.

Well you sure seem to be, because I‚Äôm completely chill, lol.

> Country or City, it doesn't make a difference. Furthermore, Singapore IS a Country, which makes your second point mute.

It makes all the difference because no one, except Singaporeans (and a few other city-state habitants) lives ‚Äúin a country‚Äù as much as they live ‚Äúin a city‚Äù on a routinely domestic level. Difference between cities within one country can be bigger than between cities on different continents.

To make my point clear - let‚Äôs say tomorrow whole of Malaysia decides to join Singapore. So overnight Singapore now has multiple cities and vast territories. 

Now, if country matters, please tell me what exactly changes for someone who lives in Singapore in terms of nature access and entertainment? 

> Thirdly, you said you don't understand it. My point is that a) It's not an argument and b) the reasoning because its merely an opinion/perspective. I am perfectly alright with people having their own, and heck, they should.

That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm trying to understand your point and have a discussion, nothing more that that. Please don‚Äôt take it personally, I‚Äôm not trying to attack you or make your opinion invalid.. I‚Äôm only talking particularly about going outside at night in KL (because I have been robbed there and the police couldn‚Äôt do anything). I‚Äôd prefer doing that in SG or UAE as opposed to KL though. 
And I have been to the US, yes its not as safe as Singapore, but my point is that unlike many other places in the world, you can go anywhere in Singapore without fear.. Walk around on the park connectors perhaps?. Indeed - where I lived I could hop on a train that runs half-hourly, stay on for 40 minutes, and get to a gorgeous park and lake! In Singapore you can't exactly do that with faffing about at the causeway, and you're never too far away from the city unfortunately. That is still wrong. Take ETH, an international Bachelor student pays CHF 650 which is about SGD 1,000 a semester. NTU charges SGD 4,000 a semester for your reference. Like I‚Äôve said, most European countries have cheaper education than Singapore. I took ETH as reference because it is a top 10 university according to the famous ranking (but the ranking itself is quite flawed IMO if we are talking quality of education), Switzerland is one of the most expensive places, and is similar to Singapore in some sense. 

The only expensive universities in Europe for international students are mainly in UK, Ireland and some Scandinavian countries. Norway, Germany, Czech Republic offers free bachelor‚Äôs (first bachelor‚Äôs if I‚Äôm not wrong). Italy charges ‚Ç¨1,500 per YEAR regardless of EU citizenship. That‚Äôs just off the top of my head some notable countries with good universities. 

Like I‚Äôve said, I included living expenses for studying/doing an internship in Switzerland. It is comparable to Singapore. The only cost difference would be tuition fees, and as I‚Äôve already mentioned, is higher in Singapore. The only drawback is like you mentioned, you might have to pay a certain amount first, but that is the same case with all universities, even in Singapore. Only difference is that you can use CPF Loan for most middle to lower class families (this is what I did as well). You can always take a loan from the bank, and from my understanding, most European countries value education highly and some even want to attract students to study there, so there are many help available (see Hungary‚Äôs monthly allowance stipend).

Back to your concern of language, which might be the only valid concern here. Yes, it‚Äôs true that language might be a problem, but there are actually quite a lot of programs and courses taught in English. You might be surprised at how well Europeans speak English despite it being their second or even third languages. I have met many Swiss, Germans, Romanians, etc who speak way better English as their second or third language compared to Singaporeans who arguably has English as their first. Also, studying within other EU nations as EU citizens is a big thing and obviously the common and popular programs are taught in the common languages, which is to say English, German or French. So suffice to say, you won‚Äôt be spoilt for choice, courses language-wise like in Singapore, but you won‚Äôt be struggling to learn everything in a foreign language either.

Also, your last paragraph. As I‚Äôve already demonstrated, nobody is asking you to fork out 40K euros upfront lol. What makes you think the university fee paying overseas works any differently than in Singapore? Essentially at least 30k of that supposed 40k is from daily expenses. You don‚Äôt pay 30k sgd upfront in Singapore and then live for free for 4 years right? The reason why Singaporeans don‚Äôt do this is another sociological topic worth a separate discussion, but from observations, basically:

1. Singapore is a safe bubble and many people think Singapore is the best (arguable, but still one of the best in the world), so they do not dare or care to venture outside - fair enough
2. Misinformation - a lot of them think that overseas universities are crazy expensive - that is true to a certain extent - US colleges and UK universities are the crazy expensive ones that people are terrified of. They also think that non English speaking countries have courses in different languages. That isn‚Äôt really true... the world is getting increasingly globalized, there are many MNCs that employ natives from different countries - Germany, China, Russia, EMEA, etc, and all of them communicate well enough in their respective functions and technical expertise, sometimes in *gasp* English. 
3. Rankings - Singaporeans culturally and conventionally look at rankings and numbers and figures. Especially because NTU and NUS are ranked quite high globally, they set it as a baseline, and as such, the only few universities that are around this level are the Ivy League schools in US, Cambridge, Oxford, etc in UK, ETH in Switzerland, Peking and Tsinghua in Asia, etc., thus they do not look further beyond these universities, of which many are super duper expensive. However the caveat is that they do not understand the metrics used in determining the ranking. In my limited experience, I am of the sentiment that despite possibly being ranked lower than Singapore, most European students I feel are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than Singaporean students in quite a few aspects, especially soft skills, only losing to us perhaps in examinations. Of course this is just an observation, and I might be dead wrong, but if you haven‚Äôt had such an experience, I urge you to reach out and judge for yourself if you have the chance! It‚Äôs always great to experience the other parts of the world and learn from a counterpart elsewhere. 
4. Some of these families are not as well to do due to certain financial circumstances that render an aspiring student unable to leave their family for a prolonged period of time.. Hello, the toilet bowl would like a word with him too.. And I assume the idea/theory/topic you are referring is ""That everybody has their own opinions and preferences"". If you really want to make it an argument, which side are you taking, since I am apparently on every side.

I don't think its considered ""chill"", when your first thought is that I am trying to get in an argument with people who considers Singapore exciting...

Then you would have to compare city-states with city-states, by your logic, and not cities. Just FYI, I'm perfectly alright with comparing Singapore and any-sized habitant.

I already stated, my interest is mostly in grand nature. Lets use my original example, Switzerland Alps. Wait, there isn't a single mountain in Singapore. Many people also have stated good reasons such as having four seasons. If you really need me to explain the nature difference between Singapore and seasonal/nature countries like Switzerland, please use Google instead.

I'm perfectly fine with a discussion, if anything that would be ideal. Though I would point out its your choice of words that stated it is an argument.. Later kena buang by PMD. Okay. Your points are very valid and I appreciate the extensive write up. Maybe Im just oversimplifying and generalizing the old trope of only scholars or the well
off are able to study overseas. I‚Äôm of the older millennial generation and it was that way when I was in my late teens/early 20s.. No worries, I enjoyed the exchange and hearing from a different perspective. I was of a similar mindset until I went over and I realized how entitled and sheltered most Singaporeans are (anecdotal experience of course). It broadened my perspective and made me appreciate what I have more.

> GO BEYOND LAWS

> However, these laws alone are not sufficient in securing the future of a racially and religiously harmonious society. This is especially so if we aspire to a harmony that is not merely the absence of racial or religious violence but also the removal of prejudice, stereotypes, bigotry, discrimination and cultural insensitivity from society.

> Government leaders seem cognisant of this fact. Speaking at a recent dialogue on race held at the Asian Civilisations Museum, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam suggested that ‚Äúto achieve real, true racial harmony, we need to go beyond the Government‚Äù.

> Echoing this, in her speech in Parliament on the debate on the amendments to the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu highlighted:

> At a more fundamental level, we cannot legislate to remove irrational fears and stereotypes, nor to accept that a set of different beliefs can coexist with ours.

> In other words, the truly harmonious society to which we aspire requires individuals and the community to play an active role in sustaining racial and religious harmony in our everyday lives.

> What happens in the family is crucial in this regard. We, the authors, can attest to it from our own experiences as parents.

> Studies show from as early as pre-school, children display cognitive awareness of racial differences, and begin showing signs of racial prejudice. They exclude their peers of different races from play and other activities.

> What can parents and other caregivers do to prevent children from taking to the path of racism inadvertently? It is certainly not by encouraging ‚Äúcolour-blindness‚Äù, where there is a denial of difference.

> Rather, the more productive approach would be to employ personal strategies that make it easier for children to treat difference as being normal.

> For example, parents can help their children identify the different cultural traditions that abound in the Singapore space.

> They can reinforce the value of this diversity and point out that while traditions and beliefs can be different, and sometimes irk their own sensibilities, they are valuable because they contribute to the diversity that makes Singapore special.

> This of course requires a degree of cultural literacy on the part of parents as they need to be aware of good intentions and aspirations reflected in these diverse cultural practices.

> It is precisely this literacy they must acquire if they are to socialise their children into becoming contributors of the multicultural harmony we have today and want to enhance looking ahead.

> An attempt to understand the diversity of traditions, people and groups here does not have to be merely academic.

> Given the diversity of the population, there are many opportunities for families to not only identify groups from a distance but to actively participate, engage in and celebrate our multicultural space.

> The upcoming Deepavali festivities are just one of the many possible cultural celebrations where parents can intentionally expose their children to the flavours of ethnic cuisine, and the beauty and meanings of ethnic art forms such as kolam drawings (floor decorations traditionally made of coloured flour).

> This is important, as interethnic understanding has important implications for social solidarity.

> For instance, an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) paper analysing a 2017 nationwide survey on community responses after a terrorist attack revealed that those who had at least some interactions with people from other communities and attended their cultural celebrations, were less likely to be phobic of a group they associate wrongly with terror activities.

> This endeavour is an uphill climb requiring constant, deliberate effort. Even as we spend time dispelling stereotypes our children sometimes mouth, it does not prevent them from being exposed to racist ideas elsewhere.

> This is certainly something that parents in Singapore recognise.

> A CNA-IPS survey on race relations conducted in 2016 found that more than 90 per cent of Singaporeans interviewed believed children should be educated about issues related to race, particularly why racism is bad for society and about what those of other races found offensive.

> Unfortunately, less than 60 per cent of parents actually have had open discussions with their children on these issues.

> Perhaps this has to do with the general discomfort some parents might feel in broaching such sensitive topics. The fear of saying the wrong thing keeps people from informing their children better.

> LOOKING TO SCHOOLS

> In fact, parents might look to the school system to help inculcate such cultural literacy or imbue in children the principles and values related to racial and religious harmony.

> Interestingly, around 50 per cent of parents with primary-school-going children surveyed in the IPS Survey of Parents and Education in 2016 believed more emphasis should be placed on the teaching of racial and religious harmony.

> This was more than those who wanted greater emphasis on IT skills, current affairs, science and Mother Tongue languages.

> While schools certainly are an important conduit for inter-cultural education, they in no way can replace the most trusted and constant figures that children have found in their families.

> Without appropriate guidance and open discussion with parents and caregivers from an early age, there is a high risk of unchallenged prejudiced attitudes being entrenched into adulthood.

> This means of course that parents themselves have to shed their prejudices and lead by example.

> The day Singapore was separated from Malaysia in 1965 was for some the end of the idea of Malaya. To others, it was a cause for celebration: Singapore was independent. On Aug 9, 1965, Singapore became a sovereign nation, after about two years as part of a merged entity with Malaysia.

> Separation, as the episode came to be called, is traceable to the early colonial history of Singapore. In 1819, English colonial traders set up a post in Singapore, enabling the East India Company in Calcutta to connect more directly to the China coasts. At that time, the established empire was China and the rising empire was British India.

> Penang at the head of the Malacca Strait had demonstrated how valuable the route was for Indian opium and the tea trade of China. Singapore provided an invaluable connection.

> Twenty years later, the British established the colony of Hong Kong and opened the treaty ports in China. The imperial relationship was reversed. The rising empire was now more powerful and the colony in Hong Kong together with treaty ports like Shanghai were its merchant garrisons. Hong Kong was directly connected to China and its Chinese residents saw how they could benefit from having a different operating system in their country.

> In contrast, from the administrations of Stamford Raffles and William Farquhar to John Crawfurd, Singapore was separated from the larger Malay world controlled by the Dutch.

> With the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, the British and the Dutch drew a line of separation in the Malacca Strait. That helped British country traders and the East India Company to strengthen their connection to China.

> Many others benefited from the convenience and also used Singapore to develop local markets. But the emphasis was on the maritime links between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.

> After the 1850s, when Hong Kong and Shanghai dominated the China trade, Singapore's role had to change. It sought closer relations with the Malay states and eventually became the effective capital of a confusing entity based on a mix of direct and indirect rule that came to be called Malaya.

> This was in part because the British global empire was over-extending north-west of India and competing with French and German challenges in Africa and the South Pacific. It was left largely to local officials and the merchant houses of Singapore to reconnect with the Malay world.

> Related Story Singapore and China sign bumper number of deals at top annual bilateral summit

> Some of their initiatives were very profitable but the overall relationship with the Malay states was never comfortable. A key reason was that Singapore was linked to the China trade from the start and depended on its Chinese population to support its plans.

> Thus the rapid rise of the Chinese population was not accidental but was to do with improving Singapore's position with China. The British strengthened that connection by bringing Baba Chinese from Melaka to help them deal with other Chinese already active in the neighbourhood, especially those who found it advantageous to use the colony's free port facilities.

> These local Chinese, with help from the Melaka families favoured by the British, adapted successfully to the emerging system. After the opening of China, large numbers of newcomers came to supply the labour force needed following the end of slavery. Most used Singapore as the transit port to the Malay states and various parts of the Dutch Empire but many stayed in the colony.

> Thus, for the British, managing the Chinese population in the colony was always important. A Chinese protectorate had to be established to deal with the growing community.

> By the turn of the 20th century, the problem was made more difficult when many became politically conscious. When Sun Yat Sen and his anti-Qing rebels were active, Singapore provided supporters for their revolution. That nationalism was now an issue of politics and security.

> Supplementing the record of what the British had achieved in the first 100 years was Song Ong Siang's 1923 book on 100 years of the Chinese, a landmark story of their multivarious involvement in Singapore's development. It was also a time when these Chinese sought a bigger role in the city's governance. For the British, they began to realise that managing the Chinese was making the task of connecting with the Malay States more complicated.

> Related Story Being Singaporean and South-east Asian

> Related Story Forging ties for the future

> It was in the British interest to encourage cooperation between Malays and Chinese, but the long-term effect of Singapore's separation from its hinterland was clear to the Japanese.

> When they renamed it Shonan in 1942, the only place given a Japanese name, they saw Singapore island as the region's imperial base. They sought the trust of the Malay-Indonesian world and helped the Indians to build the Indian National Army to liberate India from British rule. But they did not trust the Chinese who saw them as the enemy and were willing to fight them together with the British. Thus, although briefly, the different local communities were further separated.

> The connections that the British tried to establish from the late 19th century did not work. After World War II, the Malayan Union proposed was not acceptable and the Malayan Communist Party, supported mainly by the Chinese, turned against them.

> Also, the Federation of Malaya was not the British Malaya that people in Singapore had hoped for. To Malay leaders, that was always Tanah Melayu, Malay land. While the Malays needed to make concessions to other communities in order to gain the country's independence, they rejected the connections with other races that characterised British Malaya.

> In that context, the separation of 1965 should not have been a surprise.

> The hasty efforts to connect British Malaya to Greater Malaysia (Malayan peninsula, Singapore plus North Borneo and Sarawak) were more like improvisations and failed to overcome the disparate developments that had made reconnecting difficult time and again.

> What was remarkable, however, was that the generations of people in Singapore who lived through the efforts to reconnect seemed to have grasped the idea that being connected to the distant and separate from the near was something they simply had to learn to deal with.

> To emphasise Singapore's distinctiveness, the Hong Kong experience is illuminating. Hong Kong's close connections from the start with its China hinterland had led to different kinds of adaptations. Its largely Chinese population never stopped being engaged in all of China's affairs. It could be argued that they had balanced two systems under the shadow of China. Thus when the British left, that balance was lost and the China connection became overwhelming.

> For Singapore, the opposite happened. Separating from the near had given the British full control of the China-British India relationship. By 1965, the people of Singapore had internalised the early imperial linkages. They set out to build on that heritage to seek its place as a global city and turn its plural society into a viable and prosperous state. This was summed up in the idea of ""leapfrogging"" the region to reach world markets.

> There are now new challenges.

> Two are obvious. China had learnt that neglecting its south had resulted in its near-collapse. No longer divided and weak, it will not allow its coasts to be vulnerable again. It expects its relationship with Singapore to reflect that understanding.

> The other concerns the relations with a new South-east Asia from which Singapore cannot be separate. Singapore has to rebuild connections with its Asean neighbours to enable that organisation to deal with the rivalries involving new great powers. Both challenges require much rethinking, not least about how connecting and separating could be managed under these conditions.

63,Global Affairs: When green protesters hurt their own cause,dksitz,2019-10-21 00:32:12,notexthere,34,0.88,16.0," 

LONDON ‚Ä¢ For weeks, central London has resembled a battle zone.  People lying on the roads, refusing to move; others gluing themselves to  buildings, bus stations or shop windows; demonstrators camping in  Trafalgar Square, the heart of the British capital.

Some of these events were comical. What is one to make of the  protester dressed as Prime Minister Boris Johnson scaling the 96m-high  Big Ben parliamentary tower? And how about the rank of breastfeeding  mothers who blockaded the European headquarters of Google, the  technology company, in central London?

But for London's hard-pressed commuters, suddenly faced with  cancelled underground trains, suspended bus routes and even inaccessible  street pavements, these episodes weren't even remotely funny. Last  week, London commuters dragged protesters off the top of a train at  Canning Town as clashes broke out between passengers and climate  activists during the morning peak-hour rush. Nor was all this very  amusing for the tens of thousands of police officers who had to be  called in from all parts of Britain to restore order on London's  streets.

The people behind this mass act of disobedience, which was repeated  in smaller versions in many other capitals, call themselves the  Extinction Rebellion, a pressure group established last year with the  explicit aim of disrupting public life in order to force governments to  face up to the risk of an ecological disaster.

#### GOING UP AGAINST GRETA

And although not directly connected, the Extinction Rebellion - or XR  as it likes to call itself - has drawn its inspiration from Greta  Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who unreservedly  associates herself with the movement.

After British police issued an order banning further XR disturbances  in central London, Greta, who was herself leading a mass demonstration  on climate change in Canada at the same time, retorted: ""If standing up  against the climate and ecological breakdown and for humanity is against  the rules, then the rules must be broken.""

Predictably, such calls to break the law were studiously ignored by  most Western politicians, who find it difficult to argue with climate  change demonstrators. For there are no votes to be had in appearing to  dismiss the demands of well-meaning citizens, who ostensibly want  nothing more than what we all want: preserving the health of our planet  for future generations.

And how  is one to argue with Greta, the precocious child who overcame her own  personal health afflictions to reach global stardom status? When she  recently disappointed predictions by failing to win the Nobel Peace  Prize, The New York Times ran a long article probing all explanations  for her Nobel failure, without even once considering the most logically  obvious possibility: that her achievements to date may not have merited  the prize.

 

Still, and as difficult as this may be, challenging the phenomenon of  Greta Thunberg and the various grassroots movements she has spawned is  essential. For if allowed to continue unhindered, the arguments that  they espouse could have negative political implications, and push  governments into wrong priorities in fighting climate change.

#### GOVERNMENTS DOING NOTHING?

Central to Greta's argument - and to that of the XR followers - is  that governments are not only doing nothing useful to deal with climate  change, but are also ignoring the science behind the climate crisis.  ""How dare you?! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your  empty words,"" a visibly angry Greta scolded world leaders assembled in  the United Nations building in New York recently.

But that claim is too sweeping. For although the current occupant of  the White House may believe that climate change is a hoax, all  governments around the world and most of the United States' own  politicians accept that we are facing a climate emergency that requires  urgent action.

Earlier this year, the British government became the first in the  world to pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions to almost zero by 2050,  precisely by admitting - in terms echoing Greta well before she made  them - that Britain has a ""moral duty to leave this world in a better  condition than what we inherited"".

One can legitimately question whether this target will be achieved.  And one could also point out that it's easy for Britain to be at the  forefront of such pledges, since it has almost no manufacturing sector  and its services-led economy relies on other countries to produce the  energy-intensive goods it consumes.

Still, it is odd that Britain should now be at the epicentre of the  environmental agitation. It is odder still to ignore the fact that the  British example of accelerating emission reductions is now providing an  impetus in other European countries to do the same.

And it is wrong to claim - as many demonstrators do - that nothing is  being done in the US. For President Donald Trump's denial of climate  change is offset - both metaphorically and in real terms - by the action  of individual states in America, many of which are implementing some of  the most stringent environmental controls in the world.. I said this before (to negative response) and I‚Äôll say it again. The movement is well intentioned, but without the right logic, the mob is doing more harm than good by pissing people off.. Saw the rally in London. They are really turning people against their cause instead of garnering support.

Just 2 days ago protestors climbed on top of trains during the peak hour to protest. The crowd angrily pulled them off and I doubt any sliver of their message got through apart from the fact that they were disruptive and annoying. yeah greta needs to be more realistic. on the one hand global warming might end humanity as we know it, but on the other hand Shell really needs to deliver that shareholder value. it really is difficult to say which is more important. gotta be realistic.. Still waiting for these holier than thou pos to give up their latest iPhone and aircon.. I find it amusing when people and commentators are focusing so much on the messenger and how the message is being conveyed. This piece also have the ‚Äúwe are doing something so therefore it is enough considering all tradeoffs‚Äù angle. Not about the actual issue. 

It is exactly this notion which is wrong and is something that scientist have been trying to convey for many years. People dont listen and fall asleep for all the academic talk. Greta and everyone is just telling people stop for a second and really listen to them, then do something. It is ridiculous to assume that Greta should have all the answers.

I have worked in several engineering firms and many people in power there over r&d budgets, roadmaps etc are extremely conservative. The moment pressure comes from a customer or regulation they change their minds. Its that powerful. Thats the push that is needed on all levels.

Sure one can go ahead and bash Greta and other climate activist and write them off as a noisy, privileged and unrealistic. But without them you can be sure as hell the climate will be much worse off.. > The people behind this mass act of disobedience, which was repeated  in smaller versions in many other capitals, call themselves the  Extinction Rebellion, a pressure group established last year with the  explicit aim of disrupting public life in order to force governments to  face up to the risk of an ecological disaster.

i got cancer reading this. enough internet for the day. let me wipe my puke.. WHAT PROTESTERS OVERLOOK

Greta and her disciples claim that this is not enough; the XR is  demanding - on the basis of claims, yet to be scientifically validated,  that the world is facing a ""total extinction"" - that countries should  drive down all greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of this  decade.

This target is not merely ambitious; it has no chance of being  realised. Still, many around the world continue to look benevolently on  Greta and her demonstrators, assuming that even if such people are  daydreamers, their advocacy is for a good cause; this is one area where  exaggeration is regarded as perfectly justifiable.

But this is also untrue, for there is a price to be paid for  indulging the demonstrators, not least the danger of turning off support  for a worthy cause. In the wake of the fight between activists and  passengers headed for work, a YouGov poll found that 63 per cent of  respondents sympathised with the commuters who pulled the protesters off  the train. Just 13 per cent backed the protesters.

 

Amid the backlash, questions have been raised about whether climate  activists in their headlong charge have taken note of their impact on  the working class.

It is worth noting that protests are taking place only in countries  where protests are allowed; even if she was prepared to walk on foot  from Sweden in order to save on carbon emissions, Greta is unlikely to  be allowed to hold a mass rally in, say, Tiananmen Square, in the heart  of the country that is responsible for the largest carbon dioxide  emissions in the world.

Despite the evident youth and vibrancy of Greta herself and despite  her carefully choreographed pictures with other schoolchildren around  the world, in reality, many of those who back environmentalist movements  in Europe are middle-aged and middle-class white men and women, people  who don't have to worry about their next meal, and have plenty of time  to go on demonstrations.

In demonstrations in London over the past few weeks, aged hippies and  Hare Krishna chanters abounded, a reminder of past ""hot"" topics that  attracted the same crowd; among those arrested last week was the aunt of  the King of Belgium who lives in a multimillion-pound home in central  London, as well as a 77-year-old Jewish rabbi.

Nothing wrong with being white and middle class. But the reality  remains that many of the climate activists know little about the lives  of poorer people, or have any notion of what their measures could mean  for those who may be more vulnerable.

""All you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic  growth; how dare you!"" said Greta in her attack on world leaders at the  UN. It's easy to argue for tightening one's belt if one comes from  Sweden; quite another to tell people in the developing world that they  should miss out on economic well-being that others have enjoyed for  generations.

Although the sincerity of most of the environmentalist advocates  should not be doubted, it is a fact that their movement is an outgrowth  of a broader hostility to capitalism and the market economy, and to  globalisation.

In pursuit of their cause, some XR activists in Britain, for  instance, have expressed anti-immigration views as well, not because  they are necessarily racist, but because they believe in a world long  gone by, when people didn't travel much and most remained in their  communities, rose early, tended to their vegetables and then went back  to sleep when the sun set. But the biggest problem with today's  environmental activism is that it pushes governments to concentrate on  the wrong problems. Activists demand, for instance, that people should  stop eating meat, stop flying and stop driving cars. But that says more  about the sort of lives the activists are familiar with, rather than  about real environmental challenges.

#### REGRESSION IS NOT SALVATION

Even if all airline flights stopped completely and continued to be  banned until the end of this century, the rise in temperatures by the  year 2100 would decline by only a projected 0.5 deg C. And even if most  current cars were to be replaced by electric models, carbon  dioxide-equivalent emissions would go down by a mere half a percentage  point.

 

The real polluters are not air travel that wealthy but frightened  consumers in the West fret about; the bigger challenge is from the vast  and inefficient use of energy in heating homes in the Northern  Hemisphere, and the worldwide generation of electricity. And fixing this  would be a monumental challenge; in Britain alone, providing an  energy-efficient heating system to all homes is estimated to cost ¬£1  trillion (S$1.8 trillion) by the mid-century.

The salvation lies not in reversing the industrial revolution and  returning humanity to the 18th century, but in technological innovation.  As fuel cell technology scientist Don Huberts aptly remarked a few  decades ago, ""the Stone Age did not end because the world ran out of  stones"", but because humans evolved to use other implements and  commodities. The same is already happening today, as fossil fuels are  being replaced by cleaner technologies.

Salvation comes not from less capitalism and globalisation but from  more of both, from progress as a result of free competition, rather than  from the regression advocated by many of today's environmental  activists.

Undoubtedly, Greta has made an impact; this article - as well as many  others - would not have been written without her activism. But there  are multifaceted challenges involved in reducing global carbon emissions  and governments have to factor in the trade-offs and manage the costs  of change as they work towards the climate goals. Greta would need to  take these into account in order to develop into a mature politician  able and willing to change the world by advocating policies that may be  less romantic, yet stand a better chance of being implemented.

And, who knows? That Nobel Peace Prize may still go her way.. I think annoying people is part and parcel of protest and civil disobedience. But annoying *commuters on electrically-powered public transport* for the sake of protesting against climate change is counterproductive, to put it mildly.. Don't mess with people's commute to work. People preaching civility/respectability politics: need to be realistic, people need to get to work, nevermind the world is going down is flames. 

They said the same thing about Martin Luther King, and how his protests were ‚Äúcounterproductive‚Äù. Really controversial point - but we may have to implement climate engineering if we fail to progresss with the 'emission reduction' method.. >how the message is being conveyed

Eh how a message is being converyed is more often than not equally as important as the message.  


You can have the right message but when communicated it the wrong way no one gives a flying fuck about it. Especially so in canning town. Those people are low income workers getting to time sensitive jobs like construction and retail.. Climate engineering is a long shot. No one is even close to understanding the potential ramifications.. In this instance the activism is based on robust science. Who in the general public reads those scientific papers? Who goes on lectures to hear about co2 and its impact? Very few. So how do you get peoples attention? Think about it, how? Trust the gov?

Obviously there are individuals who go to far and are not patient enough to really explain to others, greenpeace comes to mind so agree there. But if we take Greta as example she has been very successful to engage a lot of people who may otherwise not been engaged at all. Is it her fault she got famous?

The point is to get people aware that there is an issue. This piece just takes one liner shots at the messengers. Not talking at all what we should do about climate change or even how they should tune the message for a broader appeal.",2739.0,9,1,1
64,MOE guidelines on planning activities for students spark debate among academics,dks9zm,2019-10-21 00:11:21,notexthere,13,0.89,5.0,"Since when is being critical the same as being ""disloyal""?

OYK obviously doesn't buy into Tommy Koh's suggestion that we need *loving critics* instead of sycophants.

Also, remember [this]( So are they going to stop all the China influence cultural clubs in SG too? 


   

A speech by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung to set a framework on what  educational institutions should or should not do when planning  activities for their students has sparked a debate among academics and  leaders at these institutions on how best to put this into practice.

Mr Ong[ said in Parliament earlier this month](  that among other things, educational institutions ""should not work with  speakers and instructors who have been convicted of public  order-related offences, or who are working with political advocacy  groups funded by foreigners, or who openly show disloyalty to  Singapore"".

He was setting out the Ministry of Education's (MOE) position on the cancellation of a module on dissent at Yale-NUS College.

Academics interviewed by The Straits Times had differing views on Mr  Ong's statement. While some welcomed the attempt to spell out principles  governing such activities, others said the guidelines were vague and  could lead to self-censorship.

Some such as Professor Simon Chesterman, dean of the National  University of Singapore's (NUS) law faculty, said the guidelines would  not change the way they went about their efforts to organise programmes  for students.

Schools already have a higher bar to meet for working with those convicted of offences, said Prof Chesterman.

However, he noted that the other two categories - those working with  political advocacy groups funded by foreigners and those who openly show  disloyalty to Singapore - are ""pretty broad"", and would be open to  interpretation.

>PREVENTING PARTISAN MISUSE  
 **I don't think these (categories) are going to be treated as  an additional set of boxes to tick on a human resources form. I see them  as an elaboration of the principle that I agree with, which is that the  university should not be misused as a partisan platform.**  
 PROFESSOR SIMON CHESTERMAN, dean of the National University of  Singapore's law faculty, on the categories of people whom Education  Minister Ong Ye Kung said universities should not work with.  
   
>  
>NEED TO BE INCLUSIVE  
 **We believe that as a society, we have to be able to be  inclusive, even of views that are uncomfortable and disagreeable, from  all parties and all sides, as long as we work towards a better  Singapore.**  
 MR JIANG HAOLIE, coordinator of student group Community for Advocacy  and Political Education and a third-year global affairs student at  Yale-NUS College.¬†  
 

Citing  the Yale-NUS episode, he said there had been robust public discussion on  whether local poet and playwright Alfian Sa'at - who was slated to  conduct the module on dissent - is indeed disloyal to Singapore because  of his poetry and activism.

But he added: ""I don't think these (categories) are going to be  treated as an additional set of boxes to tick on a human resources form.  I see them as an elaboration of the principle that I agree with, which  is that the university should not be misused as a partisan platform.""

Prof Chesterman, who has taught at universities in the United States,  Britain and Australia, also said schools are always wary of the danger  of becoming platforms to be misused.

He added, though, that there was a danger of academic institutions  and academics practising self-censorship to err on the side of caution.  But it would be a mistake if anyone did, he said.

""I can tell you I'm not planning on doing anything differently in the  law school now than I would have a month ago. Because I don't see these  guidelines as particularly controversial and I don't see them  constraining any of the activities we would normally pursue at the  school.""

NUS political scientist Terence Lee said educational institutions  would benefit ""from a diversity of views from all walks of life"".

""Having said that, educators should be mindful of inviting people who  have prior criminal records or have broken the law,"" he said.

Singapore Management University (SMU) law don Eugene Tan said he read  Mr Ong's comments as advising caution rather than an outright ban on  the involvement of those groups of people in question.

""When you invite someone to the classroom, students may regard that  person as a role model. That is where the MOE's concerns are most  pertinent. By having such people in the class, the instructor could  unwittingly send the wrong signals or mixed signals if the learning  objective is not made explicit,"" he said.

Academic institutions or instructors would have to show that inviting  certain people would have pedagogical value or fulfil a legitimate  learning objective, Associate Professor Tan said, adding that the same  principle applies to those outside of the three groups highlighted by Mr  Ong.

""The instructor should be able to demonstrate that an individual,  despite his background or past, can meaningfully contribute to the  students' learning,"" he said.

He cited the example of schools in the US that have invited people  convicted of corporate crime but who have turned over a new leaf. ""If  the learning objective of the class is to better understand the factors  that led to their unlawful actions and how it affected stakeholders,  there is a powerful learning opportunity.""

But Prof Tan also said it is possible that Mr Ong's guidelines could  easily be taken as hard-and-fast rules or out-of-bounds markers, which  would be unfortunate.

""The effect of those guidelines will then have a chilling effect, by  which I mean instructors and university administrators may opt to avoid  these potentially problematic situations and not invite the person at  all,"" he said. ""Academic freedom, properly understood, is not  compromised but it'll certainly detract from the learning process.""

The MOE did not respond to The Straits Times' questions seeking such  details. Queries sent to the three oldest universities in Singapore -  NUS, Nanyang Technological University and SMU - have also remained  unanswered.

NUS political scientist Bilveer Singh urged caution on topics such as dissent and protest.

The associate professor said he was surprised that such a course was  even proposed, as he does not think Singapore society is ready to accept  protests and dissent. The planned module came at a sensitive time of  turmoil in the domestic, regional and global arenas, he said.

""If you sanction ideas of this kind being talked about in a key  institution, what's there to stop someone from thinking we can go the  full length? There will always be someone angry enough, wanting to test  the system enough, ambitious enough, wanting to be a hero enough to say,  'Let's go out and hit the streets.' ""

Instead of protesting or demonstrating, there are other ways to  achieve one's goals, such as participating in forums and discussions or  joining a political party, he added.

He also noted that civil society, political activists and students in  the region have historically been linked to attempts to bring down the  established system.

In his speech, Mr Ong also outlined four guiding principles for  institutions: they must operate within the laws of Singapore; they must  not deviate from their missions to advance education and maintain high  academic standards; they should not be misused as platforms for partisan  politics; and they must recognise Singapore's cultural and social  context.

Professor Mohan Dutta, who headed NUS' Communications and New Media  Department from 2012 to last year, said the third and fourth guidelines  can be subjective.

#### [PAP and the politics of dominance](

What is considered partisan politics or against the social and  cultural context of Singapore can be interpreted differently depending  on who gets to define the terms, said Prof Dutta, who is now Dean's  Chair in Communication at New Zealand's Massey University.

He added that Mr Ong's speech lays out very specific principles for institutions to adhere to.

""What you have done is you have limited what are the kinds of things  that can be taught, can be studied - even more importantly, you have set  up the boundaries of who can and cannot participate.""

The cancelled Yale-NUS module would have involved dialogues with  individuals such as Mr Jolovan Wham and Mr Seelan Palay - who have  previously been convicted of public order-related offences.

The initial programme would also have included dialogues by Ms  Kirsten Han and Dr Thum Ping Tjin of the New Naratif media platform,  which the Government has said receives significant foreign funding.

Prof Dutta urged caution over what is considered disloyalty, and questioned if being critical is akin to being disloyal.

The Community for Advocacy and Political Education (Cape), a Yale-NUS  student group that promotes political literacy and social engagement,  similarly said it would not change the way it operates in response to Mr  Ong's guidelines.

""I don't think what Mr Ong said was strictly prescriptive. He was  clear that there would be room for universities to decide for  themselves,"" said Cape coordinator Jiang Haolie, 23, adding that the  guidelines simply make more explicit what most student organisations  already abide by and are aware of.

The group, which organises events and discussions on various  political topics, such as the presidential election, Parliament and  press freedom and democracy, has invited various speakers before,  including Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, Workers' Party Non-Constituency MP  Leon Perera and Ms Han.

""We've always been transparent about the way we do things. We act in  good faith and expect the people we collaborate with to act in good  faith, towards constructive politics,"" said Mr Jiang, a third-year  global affairs student at Yale-NUS.

""We believe that as a society, we have to be able to be inclusive,  even of views that are uncomfortable and disagreeable, from all parties  and all sides, as long as we work towards a better Singapore.""",1830.0,11,1,1

I left my wallet in a taxi cab, I think, and have tried contacting all of the lost and found numbers for each company. No luck. I just wanted to put out to a wide forum that it's a brown leather wallet and the name Nico is engraved inside. There are some pictures of my wife and daughter in the wallet, and about $200 cash that I'm not really expecting to see again. If you happen to see anything that fits that description, please message me or respond to this post. I'm on a ship going back to its home port, so I won't be in Singapore. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.",30,0.9,15.0,"If you boarded or alighted at a relatively public place (e.g. taxi stand at a shopping mall), there's a good chance you could have been captured by CCTV. You could try contacting the mall or building management with the time/date and see if they are able to help track down the vehicle number.. Find out what‚Äôs the cab company. The colour determines it. 

Call the company and tell them the rough date and timing of the trip. As well as pick up and drop off. 

They‚Äôll be able to narrow it down. 

Got me wallet back due to this.

Edit: also if you take cab and forgot to take receipt for expenses. You can do the above and the cab company will email you the receipt. Pretty nifty trick if you just forget.. Unless the taxi driver is not greedy or you remember the car plate number I would say you're a goner. . . .actually, how did you pay for your cab fare?. Do you remember the plate number of the taxi?. It would really help if you had a receipt because the details of the license plate number, time and destination would be on it. My mom lost her phone in a taxi and I managed to retrieve it for her using all the information given in the receipt.. it would help if u were to have more details like which taxi company/private hire? After that, driver details.. If you know what cab company you took, you can try contacting the cab company and indicate where and when did you take the cab.

It may help.. Kinda knew the USN was in town as I saw quite a few of you fellas over the weekend at the VivoCity mall.  I guess your homeport would be Yokosuka, yes?

Good luck. I was with a group of friends, and my friend covered the fare for that ride.. No, unfortunately. It didn't occur to me at the time to note it. I should start getting in the habit.. Does he have the receipt?. Do you remember the colour of the cab? If so, the colour usually corresponds to the company the cab is under. If you alighted in a place with cameras, you can try to ask them for surveillance footage to get a license plate number. With that you can try to get the driver's contact.

Also, might want to contact nearby police stations, someone might have dropped it off there. Due to the nature of taxis it might not be the one nearest to where you alighted, but there is a chance.",515.0,4,123,1

I'm sorry for bringing the average down. no wonder so many molesters about. You'll cringe when people try to compare their IQ with you, so why would you do it at the national level?. Maybe if we don‚Äôt need to wear helmet we become number 1. The helmet effect only occurs when the user is under the influence of one. Once it is removed, the user will function as it should.. I wonder why the jump from Taiwan to Iceland is so big, 4 points.

One would assume that it should be pretty normally distributed?. Iq is different from eq. IQ is really a bad measure and extremely flawed.

Take it for a grain of salt, but don't think that oh the average IQ is 100+ means I confirm smarter than the rest.. too bad only half the population need to wear helmet, maybe if we let the other half have this privilege we can be the smartest nation in the universe.. Females bring the IQ up. How many Nobel laureates are from the countries with high IQ?

I realised Asian countries top the chart with high IQ. I‚Äôm not surprised since Asians are all about studying.. [deleted]. I GPA 5.0 okay How dare you disturb me /s. Hmm, because when someone does it, it‚Äôs usually a showoff trying to flex their intellect.

Whereas these are done by (I would assume) a third party to gain insights with global statistics.. Anyone who uses this research to talk about how smart they are is instantly a idiot.. Is hk ppl wear helmet not us. Maybe we need to wear helmet then become number 1. 

Why are you starting a riot?

To become world number 1.. IQ scores are normally distributed. The problem with averaging these scores is that, well, you get scores close to 100. I'd say 4 points is not big, and is probably due to errors (measurement error, randomness/regression to the mean, etc), depending on the type of tests and its psychometric properties.  
IQ tests are also controversial and shouldn't be used as a all-rounder metric anyway.. Eq come from drops. Taiwan and Switzerland too.. With a large sample taken from each country, wouldn‚Äôt you say the difference due to errors is insignificant?. Nope, because unless someone found a way to test everyone at the same time and in the same place, there will always be stuff like history and maturation confounds. Also, the test materials would be different (language, presentation, etc). All of these are errors not accounted for.

Furthermore, the tests themselves are not perfect -  tests never 100% map on to the psychological construct they attempt to map. So there will always be an error term (calculated as below). Assuming that the IQ test administered has a standard error of measurement of 3 points, then we need a difference of 8.5 points between any 2 scores to be 95% confident that the difference in scores are not due to chance. So that means the top 10 countries' scores are most likely due to chance.

Edit: Formula for Standard Error of the Difference for individual scores (SEdiff)
SEdiff = sqrt((SEM1)^(2)\+(SEM2)^(2))
Then multiplied by 2 for 2-tailed significance. If I understand this correctly, you need a difference of 8.5 points between 2 INDIVIDUAL scores, but not 8.5 points difference between 2 SAMPLE scores. 

If my J2 stats knowledge is still with me, the variance of an average score from a sample with n individuals is (variance of individual score)/n.

That‚Äôs why the top few countries have remained more or less the same throughout the years, because we don‚Äôt just select one individual from each country, we take a sample and average the scores. Errors are minimised with large enough sample, they cancel out.

I agree with you on the cultural biases that IQ tests have though.. > If I understand this correctly, you need a difference of 8.5 points  between 2 INDIVIDUAL scores, but not 8.5 points difference between 2  SAMPLE scores. 

I think there's a misunderstanding of terms here. For me, individual scores = any type of unique/discrete scores, be it a participant's score, or an averaged score of a treatment condition/sample. But in any case, the stat/math formula focuses on the psychometrics of the IQ test (i.e. descriptive statistics, reliability and validity measures), drawing its assumptions from [classical test theory](, so it doesn't matter if they are participant's individual scores, or averaged sample scores.

&#x200B;

> If my J2 stats knowledge is still with me, the variance of an average  score from a sample with n individuals is (variance of individual  score)/n. 

I dont understand this math. (If I tried something like that in my assignments, I'd fail spectacularly. Just saying.) How can a single participant have variance? It doesn't make sense.

&#x200B;

>That‚Äôs why the top few countries have remained more or less the same  throughout the years, because we don‚Äôt just select one individual from  each country, we take a sample and average the scores. Errors are  minimised with large enough sample, they cancel out. 

As above, the test itself has errors, and having a large sample only reduces random error (errors caused by participant variation). Having a large sample does not remove any errors caused by systemic errors ([What is systemic error](, nor does it remove any confounds (if any were present). Standard error of the measurement is systemic, not random.. Okay I think I mistook ‚Äústandard error‚Äù for variance, so we‚Äôre talking about 2 different things here.

A randomly selected individual‚Äôs score can have variance. X~N(0,1), var(X) = 1. Am I wrong?. **Classical test theory**

Classical test theory (CTT) is a body of related psychometric theory that predicts outcomes of psychological testing such as the difficulty of items or the ability of test-takers. It is a theory of testing based on the idea that a person‚Äôs observed or obtained score on a test is the sum of a true score (error-free score) and an error score. Generally speaking, the aim of classical test theory is to understand and improve the reliability of psychological tests.

Classical test theory may be regarded as roughly synonymous with true score theory.

you want from western county online store - Black Friday/Cyber Monday. You can compare the historical pricing of products on Amazon via camelcamcamel.com . It even allows you to track products and informs you of top price drops. I‚Äôm looking to buy a GoPro too. But most likely hero 8 black. Hero 7 black was $395 (after coupon) from GoPro Lazada official store just a week back. Will probably wait until 11.11 to buy. 11.11 sale originated from China though. Since Lazada is backed by Alibaba, I think the sales would be pretty good.. It's only good for rare products that singapore don't stock. Otherwise the shipping fees outweighs any discount you get. Gopro is quite commonly available locally.. Check out akaso, bought it at a fraction of gopro price and am pretty satisfied. Just in case but you might wish to consider cheaper imitations.

But if you have reasons to support gopro,  by all means.. I'd say look out for deals on Shopee instead. 

While Lazada shat the bed with reduced LiveUp benefits, terminated partner deals with Citibank, gave RedMart a good ol' integration fuckery that literally nobody asked for...

SEA Group's been pumping a shit load of money into Shopee and giving out buckets full of vouchers every day and while it doesn't have subscription membership, it has partner deals with more than enough banks for you to almost always get something at a discount if you wait until a specific day (Singtel Dash on Mon, SCB on Tues, DBS on Thurs, Citibank on Sun.. etc).

Enjoy their VC money while it's still here - things will probably go the Lazada way sooner or later, especially since Shopee overtook Lazada's market share dominantly this year.. Is GoPro like the Apple of action cams. Yeah shopee has been killing it lately.

It's not about having a completely crystal-clear idea of how you want the next 40 years to play out.

basically they want to see that you know what you want to do with your life and how you‚Äôre going to achieve it in your job.. Your goal is to find the job that you are interested in. Thus you applied for this job. Because it interests you.

73,Hypothesis: the average singaporean can't really empathize with Hong Kong because we've never really cared about democracy.,dkleum,2019-10-20 15:52:47,"We've never had to fight for democracy. In the 50s our fight wasn't so much pro-democracy as it was anti-colonial. As everyone knows, we didn't even want to be a country of our own, and had independence shoved upon us, after which we had to worship economic progress in order to survive. 

Hypothesis #2: we care more about economic success than democracy and civil freedoms 

So many of the comments from Singaporeans regarding HK have to do with their distaste stemming from how messy and chaotic everything has become. We've never really had to choose between order and democracy, so of course it confounds us when we see people choose to fight for democracy at the expense of order and economic stability. There's almost a sadistic snicker underlying Singaporeans' comments whenever they talk about how HK's economy is tanking because of the protests, how businesses are moving their operations and assets away from HK and into Singapore. 

Hypothesis #3: we care more about economic success within late capitalism than about democratic freedoms.

How are we supposed to understand HK's language of civil disobedience and civic participation when we've never managed to develop a vocabulary for civic participation? We tap ourselves on the back for pRagMatiC rEsiStaNce, thinking that we've developed such a uniquely Singaporean way of making our requests heard (and being okay that it takes bloody forever) because historical amnesia has been written into our DNA. Dissenters have been painted as anti-country troublemakers in our history textbooks, and we have been programmed to see protests as anti-order and therefore anti-national. Sure, we say we are a democratic nation. But we can't forget that our nation-building happened during a time where you were either democratic or broke because the West was on a campaign to snuff communism out. So embracing democracy could be seen as a way for us to align ourselves to the US and the UK and ensure that we manage to tap on their resources so that their MNCs would come and set up shop and help us industrialize and gain economic success to the dizzying rate that most of our neighbours were only able to dream of.

We've been brought up to see economic success and bureaucratic efficiency as being at the core of what it means for Singapore to be Singapore, and tbh that's just really sad. 

Not here just to make an EdGy coMmEnt so I'm really open to having these ideas challenged! Can't say I'm a history expert but I definitely think my thoughts here are grounded in historically sound ideas, but, again, am very open to pushback. If i dont respond it means im chewing on your ideas or that i have been swallowed whole by my day job.",554,0.88,309.0,"Sg as a multicultural country full of economic migrants and their descendants, most people aren't interested in political ideology in the first place and just livelihood and stability. 

Unlike HK we did not get a lot of political refugees (that entered HK during the Chinese civil war, Cultural Revolution etc). There has been nothing really worth fighting for. Serious. No issue so far has obsessed the Singapore public to rise up in civil disobedience. Most issues have been rather smartly placated by the SG government before the issue becomes a protest. If Carrie Lam was smarter in the way she handled the crisis, instead of her pig-headed insistance in refusing to comprimise, HKers would have been just as happy as us, Singaporeans. 

The analogous issue would be China attempting to annex us. At that point, when you know that you are becomimg part of China, would you resist or bend over backwards? The answer lies in all our hearts. Fuck no, fucking isn't this what NS is for? The propaganda CB shit, the outfield, the SAR-21? However, for something like the CPF? When options are available other than civil protest? No way jos√®.. The answer is simple OP.

Economic progress puts money in your pocket which allows you to buy food, a roof over your head, the occasional luxury getaway to Bangkok or Brussels (depends on your level of SES).

Ideologies are fun to entertain in your head, but you can‚Äôt eat them. They do little for the poor but can be of tremendous power for the rich.

Your very first hypothesis is already unconvincing. We may not have had to fight for democracy, but we sure had to fight damn hard for our survival. The pursuit of democracy is not necessarily noble or wise; just look around at how many democratic nations in the world are impoverished, socially regressive and politically unstable. 

We should be fighting for good governance, which isn‚Äôt necessarily provided by democracy.

Edit: btw I‚Äôm not commenting on the legitimacy of the protests. I just think it is disingenuous and dishonest to believe that economic concerns have absolutely NOTHING to do with the HK protests. The protests are hardly purely driven by ideology and something as arbitrary as enforcing a contract- there are a lot of shades of grey in between.

It‚Äôs really anybody‚Äôs guess which aspect the average Singaporean disagrees with, OP.. I disagree. You assume that we are a homogeneous lot. We aren't. Just ask around people of different generations and you'll get vastly different answers.

Reading this forum, most of us sg redditors, including me, fundamentally support the general goals of the protests, but not some of the methods. Again, the HK protestors aren't a homogeneous bunch when it comes to tactics. Some are attacking everything China/police related, others are just putting up post-it notes on Lennon walls and whatnot.

My own hypotheses:

The HK protests are also anti-colonial in nature. HK has transitioned from being a UK colony, to a PRC one. Of course, the average HKer enjoys a better life than an average mainlander, but they're still a colony with no ultimate say over their own political destiny.

HK is also wildly economically successful. More likely than not, it's with China's help. But that doesn't de-legitimize the aspirations of the protesters. Many protesters are okay with HK businesses getting hurt because, the way they see it, many HK businessmen got rich by getting close to China in the first place, and they're having a disproportionate say in HK politics that's baked into HK's unique political system; while getting disproportionate benefits out of the HK system.

Some protesters remain peaceful, but as violence is used by both sides with no solution in sight, people are getting angrier. But Singaporeans generally draw the line where violence is used against other people.

The whole situation is pretty weird, of course. Most HKers aren't asking for independence. One of the most ""radical"" demand was for more autonomy and self-government (instead of hand-picked leaders from China). In a way, it's true to the literal meaning of ""one country, two systems"". 

Personally, I see the slogan as an unrealistic dream. It's something China would gradually but inexorably take back. Singapore's merger with Malaysia was also ""one country, two systems"" on paper. Look where it got us.

There's no easy answer to this conflict. Both sides are right and wrong.. Indeed, Singapore might just be proof that a well-run country beats a hypothetical perfect democracy.

But that's not to say that Singaporeans don't care/fight, I'm sure people care, I just think we do it not in the typical 'civil freedoms' or 'democracy' framing. 

So, for example, you don't see a blanket discussion about 'democracy', but there was vigorous debate about the controversial reserved PE. And the same can be said about the POFMA (Fake News law). There was/is concern about freedom, it's just that Singaporeans tend to not latch onto the western framing for such issues (to good effect, imo).

Singaporeans very clearly and loudly value our security and stability. This is not the kind of place where we are going to see street marches. But something like PinkDot can happen and [shift public debate]( Basically, between reformism and revolution, I think Singaporeans lean on the former (knowing full well PinkDot took over 10 years to get where it is). 

Personally, pacifist movements inspire me and I believe pacifism works. But obviously, Hong Kong is a complete 180 from us in this regard. They believe their situation is urgent and dire. Their framing of the issues is also extremely in line with revolutionary movements, and I suspect this is what doesn't sit too well with Singaporeans. But it's the choice of Hong Kong-ers, and I just hope more people understand and respect it.. >our nation-building happened during a time where you were either democratic or broke because the West was on a campaign to snuff communism out

That's a bit reductive, more accurately it was you were either capitalist or broke, whether you actually were democratic or not didn't really matter that much for keeping the money flowing. For example, South Korea, Cuba, Chile, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, were all pretty horrible dictatorships (or still are) but were heavily funded due to being US aligned.. What good is all the money if you're not free to spend it

Singapore might not be a democracy but it's leagues away from china in terms of freedom. You are working on the assumption that democracy in HK is a great thing, a noble cause to fight towards, even to burn that great city to achieve (and shame on us sinkies for not doing the same). So may I ask, what exactly are you hoping for democracy in HK to bring? 

No, not some flowery vague bullshit about muh freedoms but what real, tangible changes in policy making or in the lives of the citizenry are you assuming democracy will bring?

That it will bring stability in planning, and in policy making? Look to America, one president makes trade deals with the world, the other party comes in and everything gets turned upside down. Life in a democracy works in 4 year time-frames, at best. Is that what you crave?

That it will bring greater autonomy to HK over how they can run their city? That autonomy has nothing to do with how they elect their local leaders. The handover from Britain to China had very specific rules on what can and cannot be done by HK, and what needs consent from China. How is democracy going to change this? You are conflating two completely different things. 

That it will solve your unemployment and housing crisis, which is the real reason why thousands of kids who have no vested interest in their community are therefore ready to burn it down for a fancy photo-op? How? Look to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nigeria etc. Countries with ""democracies"" which are (to quote our great democratic leader Trump), still quintessentially third world shitholes. Clearly democracy is no panacea for these problems. 

That it will make HK an economic powerhouse again. How? You conveniently forget that for almost a hundred and fifty years, HK was ruled by an authoritarian governor chosen by a monarch a thousand miles away in England, not elected by the plebs in HK. And yet during this time, HK was one of the greatest trading ports in the world. Clearly, with past precedent, democracy is not needed to bring economic revival to HK then?

That the people's voices would be represented efficiently by the government? (This seems to me the delusion you are labouring under the most). But is it  true when you think about it? Ask the majority of Americans if Trump represents their vision of America? Ask the majority of Britons if Boris represents the best of their dreams? Ask the Turks if Erdogan's vision of a theocratic Ottamanian fantasy is what they all approve of? 

So tell me, before you shame me into buying a pitchfork, a black mask and some spray paint, tell me what exactly this  great gift of Democracy from the West is supposed to give me?. The average Singaporean is pragmatic enough to know that a governance model should not be an end in and of itself, but rather a means to an end. The idea of ""fighting for democracy"" just for the sake of ""having a democracy"" doesn't resonate with many of us.  

This pragmatism is evident in the widespread support for PM Lee's opinion:

> Mr Lee then asked what would happen, say, after their¬†demands are met?
>
> ‚ÄúWell, I think if you press the question, some of (the protesters) would, if they were candid, say, ‚ÄòWell, I don't know‚Ä¶ but anyway, I am not happy (now, so) I want this to happen,‚Äô‚Äù he continued.
> 
> Instead of languishing in this state, Mr Lee said that the city needs to start tackling the problems which Hongkongers are unhappy about.

He is basically saying ""so what if you get your universal suffrage? It's not going to solve your problems - makes no sense to have a governance model as your end goal"".  

The pragmatism Singaporeans show toward governance is also reflected in our collective support for the PAP. People here are intelligent enough to know the we're only nominally democratic under the PAP, but we still vote them in.. The Oxford dictionary defines democracy as 
>> A political system that allows the citizens to participate in political decision‚Äêmaking, or to elect representatives to government bodies.

The term ""democracy"" has been bandied about this entire conversation about Hong Kong but I feel like it has been distorted to mean something more akin to ""autonomy"" or the right to determine their own fate. Now, the word is thrown out there to attract the attention of our global issuer of ""democracy"", America. 

The harsh truth is Hong Kong has a less than perfect democracy, but no perfect democracy exists. All who participate in the democracy must abide by its rules, and abiding with rules automatically mean giving up some freedoms (read: if you follow the rules, you can't do whatever you want). ""Freedom"" is another word that will catch America's eye. 

Now all they're missing is ""oil"" to really get the White House's attention. 

Singaporeans can't be bothered because ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" just aren't ""our thing"". We love laws and complaining, and frankly legal protests are like the most exciting thing ever, especially if there's a nice big complaint that everyone just needs to hear.  That's why we love reading about HK and their fantastic legal protests. (And boo when there's a tyrannical crackdown on legal protests - gosh we wish we had them)

But we're equally consistent about our love for laws and complaining. Illegal protests that are violent (ahem riots - ahem Little India, Hock Lee, Race Riots, Maria Hertog) are a big no no. Complaining, while vile and antagonistic, must always be civil (at most add some vulgarities). 

TL;DR Singaporeans aren't interested in ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" just 'cos, but love the notion of legal protests. If it's not legal, there's nothing to take an interest in.. People will take to the streets when a government has failed its people. I hope it never ever comes to that in Singapore.. Democracy is a means to an end, not the end itself. Even as a means to that end, it is low hanging .. an easy process to prevent the worst of leaders and governments. (Seeing certain leaders in the world today, I am doubtful of even this). The problem with the world today, is that the west demonizes any form of government not akin to their forms of democracy.. sanctions, accusations of dictatorship, police state, uncivilised. This suppresses the development of alternative forms of government which may work infinitely better culturally, geographically and politically. 

I feel that your post takes too much of the high ground politically (which proponents of democracy often do).  Why do these people not embrace democracy and the struggle? There must be a reason, historically, economically or etc, as if by default, we should embrace and prefer it.. you got your history and theory wrong. 

democracy is not opposed to communism. in ‚ÄòState and Revolution‚Äô, Lenin interprets communism as the only true way of achieving perfect democracy, as opposed to parliamentary democracy which is inherently flawed. 

whether you agree with communism or not, that‚Äôs the starting theoretical position. i personally don‚Äôt, but there it is. 

secondly, it‚Äôs pure propaganda to claim that the west is interested in democracy. it is not. when Chile democratically elected the socialist Allende, the CIA instigated a coup to overthrow him. then they installed Pinochet, and no less than Hayek celebrated it. america has invaded countries for no less than banana corporations lobbying. right now there‚Äôs a Californian pistachio nut lobby for war against iran. just to maintain their monopoly. you can google it. 

the only thing the west has consistently stood for is capitalism and it‚Äôs propagation. LKY used this as an excuse to imprison his democratic rivals.

singaporeans will go out on the street when our welfare state collapses under the weight of the populace. there are many reasons why a welfare state can collapse - aging population, rising cost of living, environmental disaster, a broken world economy .... just ask the Weimar Republic? either way, i‚Äôm not optimistic for millennials. i think we are going to see hell in our lifetime. 

anyway, at that point we will probably be slaughtered by drones or something when we finally go out and protest. oh well! it will be our fault for not begging nicely for our rights (historically never succeeded, but not like most singaporeans know any history, judging by the replies in this thread). 

some other country‚Äôs citizens will sneer at us for our violence and disorder and the cycle will repeat.

just as a bit more theory and history: the main reason why socialists fundamentally hate social democracies is because they believe they will either collapse eventually or are built on imperialism. history at least seems to reasonably bear that out, particularly if you broaden your definition of imperialism to include the current exploitation of the third world for labour and resources.. Hypothesis 2 and 3 are blatantly incorrect because Hong Kong is even more guilty of this than Singapore is, historically speaking. Hong Kongers have always been more economically driven and savvy than Singaporeans.

Hypothesis 1 is worse if you know the history of Hong Kong. They aren‚Äôt even a country and they don‚Äôt desire to be. Yes, Singapore historically fought against a colonial power and had independence thrust upon us. That‚Äôs exactly the same as Hong Kong. They fought against British colonialists, now they fight against Chinese rule. They do not want independence, just their rights. So did we, because being under British rule meant we had limited rights.. Hypothesis 4: we did care initially, but it has dragged on for so long and they keep accusing us of not caring until we really don‚Äôt care anymore. It‚Äôs been months. No progress. There‚Äôs only so much foreigners can do. There‚Äôs already support from western powers, puny Singapore can‚Äôt do much but yet they make so much noise about us not supporting them. They say we don‚Äôt understand them, but they don‚Äôt understand that we don‚Äôt really want to take a stand either. It goes both ways. The more they say us, the more we annoyed, the more singaporeans start to lose support for hkers.. Well said. Thank you. As a Hong Konger / Singapore PR (soon to be Singaporean after NS!), all my peers have been asking me how I feel about the protests, and mostly end up with the same opinion that we are simply digging our own grave, so thanks for this!. it kind of saddens me when the average Singaporean cant understand what is at stake for HK. comments from colleagues are so superficial, i really wonder what would happen if this happens to Singapore one day. but if that day comes, i'll probably just migrate away. Its not simply because of the fact that we never had to fight for freedom. The average singaporean feels mostly apathetic to the issue of HK because the average singaporean doesn‚Äôt have the time or place to get themselves mired in the complications and baggage of politics, economics, history and social-political issues.

The average singaporean prefers to have food on their plate and a roof over their heads. Singaporeans are too caught up with our work that they mostly don‚Äôt have the time to discuss these issues.

These so-called protestors are letting their emotions rule their thought process. They think that china is out to get them. They think they need freedom but they haven‚Äôt thought things through. Naive idealism of western democracy isn‚Äôt going to help their case. Its going to make it worse. The US can talk about freedom and human rights as much as they want but its nothing but a farce.

They want to use HK as a buffer state to control china. They most certainly don‚Äôt have the good-hearted intentions to help HK. They would gladly use HK as a excuse to sow dissent and chaos through HK and point fingers if china dares retaliate and crack down on this movement even though the US and many countries did the same and ruthlessly crack down on any form of protest movement.

China for their part are wisely staying out on this and knows best to not soil their hands in the conflict and will willingly see HK tear itself apart until they swoop in and ‚Äúliberate‚Äù HK from the rioters once the HK government pleads for china to intervene. 

Though given recent controversies such as the blizzard case. China on the internet and media part have been desperately trying to cover up this incident up which is counter intuitive as it just makes the chinese government look like a child and clamp down on any who don‚Äôt agree with them. Its like a ostrich hiding its head under the sand and pretending nothing‚Äôs happening.

The HKers are digging their own grave at this point. The ramifications of the aftermaths of the protests would be massive. Something HK will never recover from not just economically. This protest was doomed to fail from the start especially when the rioters damage mtr lines, beat up those who don‚Äôt agree with them and beg other governments to save them and wear masks which gives them the anonymity to do whatever they want and propagate whatever message they wished and be damned the consequences of their actions.

The HK police are not handling the situation well perhaps and have been quite violent in many cases but like i said, these rioters have clearly gone in over their heads. The time for calm words and discussion is over. The line has been crossed.. One have to ask whether people like OP, who keeps questioning Singaporean and linking our lack of support for rioting in HK to democracy, are themselves, Singaporean. You guys really need to stop having this kind of weird ideas on our perspective of Democracy and Freedom

The average Singaporean not supporting the current riots have nothing to do with whether we care or not for democracy and feeedom

OP and most of the people complaining about Singaporean not supporting the riots seem to have totally forgotten we actually supported the protest in the beginning



Support started to wane after the Legco invasion and as the violence stepped up

Clearly, we have nothing against the HK protest and fight for their freedom, it's the violence that most of us have a problem with

It's nothing to do with whether we care for democracy and freedom and certainly not antipathy, if it was we would not care enough to find out about the violence going on in HK and form a negative opinion about it. Big sweeping statements from both sides really üòè (plus we really are only getting mostly one side üôÑ. I'm keen to hear more about why this:

> and tbh that's just really sad 

I'm more pragmatic so I'd agree with some of the other commenters in seeing democracy not as an absolute moral right but a means to the end of good governance.  I don't really feel that I know what the ""average"" Singaporean cares about democracy or governance.  Regarding HK, I don't see any productive end to the protests that will improve governance.. > Hypothesis #3: we care more about economic success within late capitalism than about democratic freedoms. 

This is not a mere hypothesis. This is established fact. You are almost there son. Wow, and I thought we have too many loans to think about anything else .. But fighting and causing others to lose jobs and get hurt is stupid af. U want change the country? be a politician and do the civilized way. 

Not happy about your country? Then leave your country.. hardtoswallowpills.jpg. Did a brief rundown of the top comments and to my suprised, we Singaporeans are actually looking at this from a point of view whereby we focus on the real underlying issues. Now if you take a brief look at YT, most westerners would simply comment below such a comment like ours, WUMAO, CCP BOT, CCP DOG, COMMIE, ""a good commie is a dead one"" CCP Mouth piece, etc. The list goes on, they dont seem to care what are the actual issues on hand. Biased western media reports, misleading headlines, media outlets supporting the violence, by focusing only on the peaceful protest, and now showing the side of the violence. Thats the hypocrisy of the west, you have America working closely with their strong allies in Saudi Arabia, whereby there are virtually 0 human rights, and then they support hongkong, where there are actual human rights and freedom except for universal sufferage thats it. For 155 years British never gave HK any democracy, not even the slightest bit, Chris Patten's incredible response was HK had democracy all along, because their chief executive leader were elected through democracy in Britian in that sense, the HK people had democracy. haha The HKers should be protesting and voicing out against their housing issue. Give the land to the people!. You‚Äôre wrong OP - the average Singaporean can‚Äôt sympathise with the honkies because we‚Äôve never had to suffer like them - imagine being a Uni/poly grad with non-rich parents but you still worked your ass off and at the end of the day find that you cannot afford housing and have to rent for the rest of your life - and even then, the housing is shitty.
In Hong Kong - if you‚Äôre a non-elite, it‚Äôs almost impossible to climb your way out.
They‚Äôre not destroying what is theirs - they‚Äôre destroying what they can never have.
I sympathise with them - but even I can see, the end will not be pretty.. Why is empathizing always one way?

It's just like UK or BBC media, once every 2 months attacking Singapore. Why they can't reach out to us or try understand our context of a nation?

Empathy is something that can only be given if subject A go through the same conditions as subject B thus formulate a emotional feedback. 2 conditions were never the same.

Everything else is pretty much fake.

Empathy used in this situation is pretty much a luxury word.

We, humans, living in the West or East system, have this pre-conceived idea that our system should over rule that ""poor"" second rated living system of yours.

In truth, it is that both sides never truly look at themselves, they never truly have the humility to de-centralise thinking.

In short, humans are self centered (not selfish). Regardless of system, the thinking must be progressive, not I don't like this, I destroy. That is advancing to stupidity.

There's so much more than the pro-hong kong sides, there's also stories the other side, you know? But we choose our beliefs according to narratives setup by the media.

Look people bash us for not taking sides. So looking out for both sides is wrong? I thought looking out for both sides is actually true human, looking them both as human is more correct ever than radically politicizing any side as a single good side.

Our general human purpose/stance should be set for resolution, not aim at the purpose of creating clash between families, societies or nations.. > We've been brought up to see economic success and bureaucratic efficiency as being at the core of what it means for Singapore to be Singapore, and tbh that's just really sad

Agreed with a lot of the post until this:

1) Because we prize it doesn't make it the only part of our identity. ""Singaporeanness"" may include economic success. Singaporeanness is also a lot of other things that we enjoy and do that make us Singaporean. I don't see what's wrong with that. You can't assume identity by just one single factor.

2) There's nothing inherently sad about economic success. It's much better than economic failure, and a huge concern for a lot of people. If you've never been poor enough to have to worry about the economy, well, check your damn privilege. Hell, the HK situation is particularly exacerbated by an incompetent bureaucracy and a slowing capitalist system that never prioritized social needs like affordable, good quality housing. 

3) If you look at the history of humanity the democratic experiment is a relatively recent phenomenon - and it's hard to tell if it's really better and more stable, in the long term, than any other system of governance. Whether it leads to better happiness outcomes than other systems. As things are going now with Trump and Brexit, well, who knows. 

4) This narrative obsession with democratic freedom also only thrived because of the strong economic success of the US post world war 2. It's exactly that - countries tried to align themselves with democracy to align themselves with the powers be. You can't push an ideology without economic success. And in the end democracy is exactly that, an ideology. It comes in different forms, and some particular form of democracy - as dictated by some specific western ideal you appear to allude to - should not be an objective in of itself. 

5) There's also nothing inherently good about ""democratic freedom"". Well the term itself is badly defined. It's clear from your statement that you believe Singaporeans do not see the utility of some particular democratic freedom, and perhaps you should be more open to trying to understand what democratic freedom really means. Yes, lots of organizations create highly arbitrary indexes that can be adjusted to say anything. But I think you need to look more closely at the individual components to really decide if and why a measurement is a bad thing.. Good points. But seeing what I saw today, I think the protest didn‚Äôt need to go to this extend (Pardon me. Not a good reader so I skipped a lot of your post but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)

I saw protesters burning what seems to be a hole dug by them, with plastic bags of trash (I think). Creating a big flame with choking black smoke, beside an estate, then 5 minutes later, the protestors realised the flame is too big and can‚Äôt be put out by your normal fire extinguishers. They ran by and took the remaining plastic bags out. What are they trying to prove by doing this? What are they trying to prove, by going against the law and order? Even if they really want something to be done, a reform or a separation from China to be their own, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay to halt the innocent bystanders life, blocking the roads, preventing traffic, setting fire to the MTR, bus stops and even shopping centres. What are they proving, by having mini protest in other countries to ask for help? Attending a NBA game just so they can tell the world ‚Äò Hong Kong is on fire‚Äô? I think the world already know there‚Äôs something wrong in Hong Kong, there‚Äôs really no need for them to bash anyone who has a different view from them. 

But then again, maybe we haven‚Äôt had their hardship, maybe if we were in the same situation, I would‚Äôve set things on fire too. Who are we to judge? Please correct me if I‚Äôm too naive and wrong. But I think they are not ‚Äòstanding up to the government‚Äô they want to kick them out and then control the country by themselves. Are they ready yet?. Honestly HK people are special snowflakes. Somehow we have to care about them but not the Kurds, the Indonesians, and other brown people. Why?  I'll have you Honkies know that I pray everyday for Kurds to survive evil Turkey. They face real issues there.. make a person worry about their ricebowls and have them attack their own neighbours and you‚Äôll never need to fear them ever again. From my observation, the public here follows the concept of ""performance legitimacy"" that a government is legitimate if it delivers the goods.

The current government knows this, and add to the fact that Asians in general are more subservient in the face of the only authority figure they know, they would tolerate whatever happens so long as their own personal and financial interest are not greatly affected to a degree. Couple with the mentality of, Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.. Protesting and speaking up critically are viewed negatively here. That‚Äôs the root of it all.. Democracy and democratic elections are processes, not the end goal, it's merely one of the tactics meant to give us our desired results, i.e. a better quality of life. The problem is many young idealists are confused and seems to confound democracy as the end goal and starts to correlate 'democracy = better quality of life'. Even worse, they seems to have concluded that 'ONLY democracy = better quality of life'.. Singapore's political system maintains enough of the trappings of democracy to keep its ruling party anxious to do a good job in governing and satisfying public opinion. 

Whereas Hong Kong's government has to balance keeping the public, tycoon class and Beijing happy.. I can‚Äôt speak for all Singaporeans. But it looks to me the society focuses so much on ‚Äúsocial harmony‚Äù and the people kind of internalised that already.. The average person is more concerned with their personal issues, and doesn't feel that a more democratic government would help them achieve that. Perhaps it's the thinking that everyone is responsible for themselves. Perhaps there is a lack of alternatives to vote for anyway, even if a more democratic government would lead to more people going into politics. Perhaps the concept of democracy has a bad reputation after what has happened in democracies in the recent decade.. We don't empathize with HongKong because we are not a western country and we don't see China as this Nazi or North Korean like totalitarian country .

One only has to look at democratic India, philippines and Indonesia where half of the populace doesn't even have access to either clean water, health, sanitation, education, food security, income, etc ,. to know what good democracy actually is. It's political ideology . 

HKers are in that situation because of an entrenched capitalist system and government, and because of their own cultural hubris of being unable to adapt to mandarin or english centric culturally (worlds no.1 and no.2 language respectively)

It's shifting realities for HK. They need to adapt , but both the people and the government are stubborn.. >	But we can‚Äôt forget that our nation-building happened during a time where you were either democratic or broke because the West was on a campaign to snuff communism out. So embracing democracy could be seen as a way for us to align ourselves to the US and the UK

Let‚Äôs just say that you need not be democratic to receive strong support from the US. The US actively supported various authoritarian regimes such as Ngo Dinh Diem‚Äôs, Marcos‚Äô, Suharto‚Äôs, Park Chung Hee‚Äôs, just because they were all openly anti communist.. Singapore policies are targeted to protect its own citizen to a large extend, housing , healthcare, pension and employment. Whereas , HK is total free market.  

We didn't have much political freedom or freedom of speech(on political matters) since independence.. I think what irks me abt comments on the HK issue on SG social media is not the condemnation of violence (which should rightly be done), but rather the lack of attempts to understand the issues that the average HK-ers face. A good start would be to talk to friends from HK & gain more perspectives, before jumping around with our judgement guns blazing... Disagree. The PAP with its laws, extensive changes to Election laws and regulations has basically crippled Singaporeans  from engaging in democracy like other countries including HK. 

Unlike HK, our laws forbids us to assemble or even go on strike. OP also forgets the decades where Politicians were routinely sued and made bankrupts which had a chilling effect on anyone who considers dissent. As we speak, Terry is being sued for defamation for comments made by the PM's siblings. 

It's like condemning the people of China and Russia for their inability to bring about change during the Communist Era.. I don't think the fuss in Hong Kong is about democracy. Insecurity about their superior identity, maybe.

EDIT: spelling. Hypothesis #4:

We did care, and we hoped for the best, for dialogue and compromise on both sides. But now it has just turned to a shit show mob rule with people on both sides with the siege mentality of 'either you're with us, or against us' and attack anyone who does not take their side.. Unpopular take: your hypothesis #2 is true for pretty much everyone in the west who feels like they have economically benefitted from globalism.  There is nobody who is fighting for actual democracy.

The only people fighting violently even for free speech in the west are thedonald true believers and ""sovereign citizens."". The average Singaporean is apathetic to everything. As long as nothing affects the fish bowl, the goldfish are content.. Hong Kong system is fucked, guess what? the Chinese government doesn't really care what the residents think. 

The moment the protestors got violent, they are truly fucked.


How do I feel? I can't visit them for holidays.

Edit

Don't forget, the Chinese government doesn't give concessions. Even if they want to, they can't. Otherwise, some other province will try the same trick and in no time, is a rebellion. Democracy is not the only viable system. Brunei seems to do pretty well with a monarchy.. That's the common mind set amongst my friends that the protestors are in the wrong and they should just obey China and not be savages. A lot of ""not my problem"" mentality and just dismiss the protestors as protesting for the sake of creating chaos.. Hi, I‚Äôm a Singaporean student. I flew over to Hong Kong recently to watch the protests. I think what the HKers have are a strong passion and love for their country. Apart from that, most people at least have a Friend or relative that was a victim of police brutality. They‚Äôre marching not just for ideology, but for justice. I believe Singapore has a relatively transparent legal system, and we‚Äôre mostly free of external influence. Lastly, I think the average singaporean is too afraid of authority or sacrificing their potential career/educational prospects. We don‚Äôt have the guts to take to the streets. It takes a lot of courage to stare down a squad of riot cops pointing guns at you. It‚Äôs easy to talk about how you‚Äôre different, how you would dare to do things. These things change quickly when you‚Äôre hit by tear gas and pepper solution from water cannons. The HKers I were with stood their ground - they fought back when the cops charged and beat up their friends or launched tear gas at the reporters. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I was pretty scared myself and I didn‚Äôt stay too close to the frontlines. Does the average Singaporean really have that resilience? I hope we never have to find out.. I will tell you what's up with the entire population being apolitical, the load of us who go through the education system are fully fixated on memory work, it therefore nullifies the purposes of subjects in the humanities which are geared and designed to help you think critically towards glocal issues such as politics.. I guess in some part some pro democracy in HK feel they are also demonstrating on behalf of the 1 billion other who cant outwardly speak, or can only speak 'pro ccp'.

And thuggish behavior like almost killing the pro democracy leader using hired guns is similar to north korea. But this is scary because its a superpower behaving like this and not just a tiny crackpot leader.

 I do think it is worth demonstrating against. At the cost of damaging atms and mrt stations although it does not create any significant policy change but it puts pressure and international spotlight onto china and their methods.  Of course all the china chinese will be saying do this in washington and the police already put 50 rounds into you. But its not feasible to kill hundreds and thousands of people especially on tv. Someone gild this post please. OP you are spot fucking on.. People in Hong Kong love their country (or island), even if their country falls, they will stay and fight against the dictators till their last breath.

Singaporeans love money. Once the money runs out and everything goes south, we jump ship to the next better company (country). It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, when fulfilling the basic needs in SG is already such a struggle for many, we won't be entertaining stuff like freedom or democracy.

The best way to control a population is to keep them poor.. SG is never the country under the rule of law, it's the country ruled by a family.. They recognise the worth of their freedom, we insist on valuing our lives.. They are fighting for democracy, we are fighting for survival. Huge difference.. Because easy talk cock aiyo HK protestors all dumb shit students troublemakers and gangsters when SG police don't collude with state sponsored terrorists beat everyone to near death in Bishan MRT and pay grab drivers to run over people in street.. Just shows how apathetic Singaporeans are? Which had been established multiple times. As long as our own tiny bubble does not burst most of us wont care.. No.2 is true. As long as the heartlander has a roof over his head,can live comfortably,he gives zero fucks about having the right to express opinions. 
He agrees with the constant reminders by his party leaders that freedom of speech will lead to a decadent Western society and as Asians he doesn't want to be a part of it.. >Sg as a multicultural country full of economic migrants and their descendants

Hong Kong is not the only place in the world that's experiencing some form of unrest, but it's the only place whose citizens single out our country for support/sympathy. And their reason for doing that is simply because majority of Singaporeans are of Chinese ethnicity, so they expect some kind of twisted ""racial unity"".. I agree Singaporeans tend to be more apolitical due to our overarching economic interests as compared to HK. But is it fair to trace the cause of our difference to migration? Last year there was actually a net outflow of migrants. Those that came and stayed on to be PRs/citizens  are a tiny minority due to the large number of foreign workers. 
Sure, you can argue that our ancestors that came here on junk ships don‚Äôt know how many lifetimes ago are economic migrants, but are we, their distant descendants, influenced by their beliefs at all? Also, it appears that the politically active group in HK are the youths, who actually led the 2014 protests. The ‚Äòpolitical refugees‚Äô you described, the youngest of whom are 60+ are comparatively indifferent. Your entire argument that the political issues we face pale in comparison to HK rests on one fallacious analogy. China invading us is clearly much more than a suppression of our freedom, it‚Äôs an act of war. Of course we will load our SAR 21s and fight then. But we didn‚Äôt sign a ‚Äòone country two systems‚Äô treaty with China. HK did. China, as the legal seat of government, has the right to enforce this treaty by imposing its laws on HK, including laws that limit the freedoms and erode the democracy of HK. And HKers are not happy. So the correct analogy of China ‚Äòannexing‚Äô HK is, our own government the dear PAP suppressing our freedoms, through the blatant gerrymandering of GRCs, the blanket censorship and suing of opposition figures, the arcane anti-free speech laws...the list goes on. The difference between HK and us is that we simply don‚Äôt care about the values of democracy as much as they do.. > The analogous issue would be China attempting to annex us. 

I can understand that, but how would tearing up our country and hurting our own people and destroying their livelihoods be the right answer in any way?. Have you forgotten 2011 already?. A successful government (and one that gets reelected) deals with three things. Jobs, housing and health. It is the same everywhere, expressed in different measures.

Governments are merely a means to those ends. Ideology facilitates government/citizens by allowing the people choice or perception of choice if the government does not seem to reach the goals.

HK protests about the lack of levers as it is about the lack of progress to those goals.. Democracy is a means to good governance. Yes, there are other ways to good governance. We got to good governance through arguably non-democratic means. But a well-designed democracy is safer against a malicious or incompetent government than a non-democratic nation.

I think we haven't come to the point where we've had to test that yet, and we can only hope that if or when it comes to that, that we make it through alive.

> Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.. >Economic progress puts money in your pocket which allows you to buy food, a roof over your head, the occasional luxury getaway to Bangkok or Brussels (depends on your level of SES).

Hong Kong has been extremely economically successful but they also have the distinction of the most unaffordable housing market. All the money in the pocket of people is no fix for the issue.

This is what OP means by ""the average singaporean can't really empathize with Hong Kong"".

Money is just one reason you have a roof over your head Singapore.

The other is undeniably our Housing and Development Board, which is a product of our democratic system(s): the people who pushed for it, the leaders who were courageous enough to make tough choices and pursue a vision for Singapore that included no one sleeping on our streets.

That was a generation that cared and knew that money and a good economy alone wasn't the answer. And you prove OP right, singaporeans today don't care the same way.. Equilibrium then.. >Ideologies are fun to entertain in your head, but you can‚Äôt eat them. They do little for the poor but can be of tremendous power for the rich.

That depends on which development stage you are talking about. If SG is a poor country like 40 years ago then this is partly true because ideologies cannot provide the answer to the immediate problem. But today the situation is different. I believe that neither SG nor HK is a place where most people are struggling with poverty. People are looking forward to the next stage such as LGBT rights, freedom of speech, going green, and animal protection. And this is exactly the stage where ideologies come to play.

Edit: fix grammar.. succinct point on good governance Vs ""democracy""

Reddit users over the world are mostly from the west. the word ""democracy"" suffers the same fate as ""freedom"". everyone says how good it is because they heard it from someone else how good it's supposed to be.. The problem with not clinging to ideologies depends on the level of reason your ideals hold. I can live with restrictions on my freedom I guess, as long as I have a place to live, food in my stomach, and hope for the future. Where it gets sticky is when you read about the alleged atrocities happening to others - ethnic cleansings, forced organ donations, asserted dominance over neighbors. The level of violence they are willing to apply, way out of proportion to the slights they believe they have suffered. It was the thinking before that economic success would lead to a reasonable government and strategic ally - but the opposite seems to be happening. And I wonder if one day they will turn their attention to Singapore and lust after what we have here.. > The protests are hardly purely driven by ideology

Not necessarily. Ideology and economic concerns are intertwined.

HK continues to be relevant because of its perceived separation from China with rule of law, freedom of expression and a decently educated populace, which so happen to be byproducts of democratic values - even if HK never really got to have their own elections in the first place. Take away rule of law, independent judges and other freedoms which HK currently enjoys, and you'll see all the foreign enterprises flee the place. If those values weren't so important to HK's economic viability, those same companies would've preferred to set up shop in Shenzhen instead, but that hasn't happened.. I think we're in agreement that sg had to fight for its survival and, even though it's quite obvious what my position is, i think what i was trying to get at here wasn't so much what we *should* be fighting for, but why we simply can't relate with HK. China promised a one country two system agreement until 2047, promise turned out to be empty, i wouldn't blame it on hk for raising hell.. @wfsparrow have you been to hong kong and talked to the locals about the protests?. You just proved his point with your answer.. Oh geez, must be fun to get your organs harvested and then sent to a concentration camp! Democracy can‚Äôt provide that!. Waving American flags and petitioning for British citizenship doesn't seem very anti-colonial to me.
That's actually exactly of the main things that don't sit well with me regarding these protests.. Fair points! To clarify, i was thinking about the average singaporean. Obviously the reddit lot is slightly more liberal than the gp for the most part.. I think China's the one clearly in the wrong for this case, because they're the ones reneging on the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

You don't get to share the blame when you're the one breaking the terms of the contract.. Isn't that sort of change kinda slow. No matter how painful a quick, successive change would probably be better.. Thanks for sharpening that! Although i think we can agree that capitalist and democratic were/are often conflated, especially in the context of anti communism.. IIRC Singapore imprisons and executes more capita than China. The US imprisons 7 to 1 more times of her own citizens per capita in her for profit prisons, than China. 

So to say that China is not freer than Singapore , is not necessarily correct, and is also closer to a misguided western perception than the truth. 

China is not Nazi Germany. Or another version of totalitarian North Korea . If you think it is then you are a victim of fake news or ideology.

If ordinary PR Chinese didn't have the freedom to persue their livelihoods the way they did , they wouldn't have become the 2nd strongest economy from a gdp per capita worst than Africa in the 60s.. The funny thing was HK was not even democratic under UK. The HK riot movement is a political and ideological movement, that doesn't actually bring any real benefit to HK, especially by antagonizing China politically and economically, which they depend on financially.

It's quite clear that the HK protest movement has it's origins from it's ex colonial masters and is sparked and driven by western organizations. Which is also why LKY limited western news agencies and western bodies to print and say whatever they want in singapore.. >and shame on us sinkies for not doing the same


Singapore is still a Democracy btw. The PAP still has to listen to the people. 


>That it will bring stability in planning, and in policy making? Look to America, one president makes trade deals with the world, the other party comes in and everything gets turned upside down. Life in a democracy works in 4 year time-frames, at best. Is that what you crave?


Thats an interesting way of viewing it. The point of democracy is to limit power. Sure there is less stability in policies and planning, however it also prevents massive corruption that is a result of authoritarianism as power is controlled by the few. 


>That the people's voices would be represented efficiently by the government? (This seems to me the delusion you are labouring under the most). But is it true when you think about it? Ask the majority of Americans if Trump represents their vision of America? Ask the majority of Britons if Boris represents the best of their dreams? Ask the Turks if Erdogan's vision of a theocratic Ottamanian fantasy is what they all approve of?


This might come as a surprise but yes they do enjoy massive support. What exactly is negative about this?  How is China, a system where even if leaders make mistakes noone can question them any better? A leader so thin-skinned to jokes that winnie the pooh gets banned.. You talk a lot but you assume that democracy is inherently western. I'd give you a more earnest response but tbh even getting through all your bad faith arguments took quite a bit of my energy away. Tldr i think you're massively discounting the fact that a lot of the protesting is driven by China's encroachment, which is at the core of all the action. But of course you'd be eager to overlook HKers' repudiation of Chinese interference and their simultaneous inability to do much..  democracy is not opposed to communism. Boi, name me just one democratic communist state. ""Do you really think Singaporeans support HK? THINK AGAIN."" 

üî•üî•Posts straits times comments section.üî•üî•

Yeah, eventually they will get what they wished for.. Funny, from very early on (July/August) I already read a lot of comments on Facebook or Reddit from Singaporeans calling the protestors cockroaches or wishing for the PLA to pull a second Tiananmen and murder some more people.. I think that the answer is even simpler than that: The average Singaporean is too critical and cynical to simply believe in one-stop-shops. Education doesn't have much to do with it because HK is just as well educated if not even more so than SG. 

Singaporeans have become incredibly skeptical of shamans peddling magical cure-alls. We know that although Philippines, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia and a hundred other countries are democracies, it hasn't exactly turned out the way that CNN and BBC guarantee it will. 

Decades of hardship, ethnic animosity and violence and the fear of a communist takeover or invasion have imbedded in Singaporeans a survival instinct that HKers simply don't have. We are pragmatic and think very, very carefully before doing whatever we do, something that HKers never had to.. > They think that china is out to get them.

Serious question, what makes you think China isn't out to get them given China's track record with territorial disputes and treatment of the autonomous regions?. This. Totally. The protestors don't even know what they are fighting for any longer. Or are they simply puppets at this point?

I think OP needs to take a step back and really look at the facts presented rather than simply tying it to an ideology. It's the smallest;albeit loudest minorities that are instigating these protests on the ground. Behind the scenes there are obviously more cynical intents from foreign influences driving the cause. Reddit is a good place to start as you can quite easily find both sides of the story. I won't link them but with a little effort I'm sure  you can find those answers yourself.

There's no utopia and there's always going to be a scenario where we settle for the lesser of 2 evils.


Edit on the last part of my previous post: 
Apologies.. I had 2 perspectives here and did not capture them correctly in the last part of my previous post.

There is violence and I definitely condemn that.. now the violence however is mostly instigated from the protestors' perspective, rather than the law enforcers. 

The second perspective I was trying to capture here was that the ongoing protests in HK are relatively tame compared to the rest of the world. There is obviously an underlying reason for that.. Quite sad to worship economic success as a god; I'd rather we have sustainable growth while being able to make room for civic participation and not obsessing so much over being #1 at everything.. Yes daddy. It's symptomatic of leaderless protests. They are often effective in the short run, but without a rudder, things can go sideways pretty quickly.

The issue is that, if the movement had a leader, they would've been swiftly dealt with, as historical precedent has shown. Leaderless protesting is the virtually the only choice they have.. We can care for more than one group of people so fuck erdogan too lol. Whataboutism really?. I agree. Kurds are being slaughtered by  
   Erdogan, all because trump selfishly puts the needs of white men above the people America swore to protect. That kind of betrayal is unacceptable. Should give them a tour of all those ""democracies"" right here in SEA. The problem with idealist selling democracy as the end all be all is their extremely narrow view. They only look at countries in northern and western europe as well as the US pointing to these as examples of how great the system is working ignoring the fact that the vast majority of countries with democratic system and places no one wants to live in.. I agree with you and i think this is part of what i meant when i said we never managed to develop a vocabulary to understand the language HK is speaking in.. No,there may be some pride inside them, 

but are u saying protest last for 4 months is still fighting for superior identity ???. As someone who lived in Brunei for 10 years, no its not. They're suffering from brain drain in the country as people studying abroad ended up staying abroad and the city seems to be stuck in a time bubble that didn't move forward since the 80's.. And in their quest for justice, it's fine to use unjust methods such as destroying Chinese owned businesses and beating up people because they are from China? That's the definition of hypocrisy. They started out noble but now they are rioters. All we need is an IED going off and they can be classified as terrorists.. I wished average Singaporeans were as liberal minded as you are. >I guess in some part some pro democracy in HK feel they are also demonstrating on behalf of the 1 billion other who cant outwardly speak, or can only speak 'pro ccp'.

Not exactly, the young ones that have been active in HK ""politics"" since 2010 onwards especially the few that goes disqualified for mucking up the LegCo oath. The irony that Chinese territory has a LegCo oath in english is too thick to even get through. The extents that HK SAR basically run the whole show barring needing to create their own defense forces (PLA garrison barracks inside HK) is so understated that the encroachment is really just a talking point.

>And thuggish behavior like almost killing the pro democracy leader using hired guns is similar to north korea. But this is scary because its a superpower behaving like this and not just a tiny crackpot leader.

I do not think a few South Asian thugs are actually even remotely interested in HK democracy. Note that despite being a full Chinese territory, HK SAR allows permanent residency status with basically full access to the SAR's benefits (including voting rights). My advice, do not just read r/HK that circle jerk that deletes threads and comments that contradict or show evidence of rioters initiating violence unprovoked is not a good place to get info.

>I do think it is worth demonstrating against. At the cost of damaging atms and mrt stations although it does not create any significant policy change but it puts pressure and international spotlight onto china and their methods. Of course all the china chinese will be saying do this in washington and the police already put 50 rounds into you. But its not feasible to kill hundreds and thousands of people especially on tv

Except that the police did behave much more harshly when it comes to the protests that take place in USA. Let's not talk abt USA internally. The silence on Chile's decision to use the freaking army on the protesters, the Western world's major powers not supporting Catalonian independence or other secessionist movements that are not overtly engaging in terrorist activities like the old IRA is very telling. There are casualties from the yellow vest protests in France. Yet no EU state is giving Macron a ticking. Spanish Court sentenced the Catalonia leaders for secession, no Catalonia act being tabled in US Congress. Virtue signalling and anti-China sentiment should be called out for what it is. If anything, the USA at the very least needs to stay out of internal affairs of China. It is so neo-imperialist that I find it kinda disgusting. Perhaps Beijing should pass some ""clean water guarantee bill for Flint"" or ""no more USA school shooting bill"". I would like to see Pelosi describe the Catalonia riot as a beautiful scenery too.. These people who are protesting aren't rich or talented enough to migrate overseas. That's why no country even their ex colonial master or Taiwan are not offering them refugee status.. The average Singaporean is too poor to migrate overseas as well. Not a PAP fan but I don't think Singapore as a whole is poorer or worse off than HK.. And R Kelly is fighting for his life.. You think the HKer will care if the riots happen here?. Uh, China happens to have a Chinese majority too you know.... No one in Hong Kong really singled out Singapore on purpose. Singapore somehow singled out itself from the rest of the world. Online comments on Hong Kong situation by Singapore netizens were mostly indifferent and showed lack of empathy. Many siding with Hong Kong government in describing protesters as cockroaches and rioters and hailing police‚Äôs use of force. Singapore leader also became a rare international figure who condemned HongKong protesters. 

I have yet figured any other country, apart from mainland China, that had done the same. So I guess it‚Äôs just natural for Hong Kong people to single out Singapore in their debate.. Therein there are also social issues surrounding HK's economy and fucked-up land pricing that drives people to action. If SG had the same problems (if the current trajectory does not reverse itself), then SG will see unrest. As it is now, SG government has done a wonderful job placating Singaporeans, giving us what we want, with the middle-upper-middle class happy with the way their lives have been going. Those in power are happy, those in privilage are happy, only those in low-SES are unhappy, but what can you do when you are lowly-educated, struggling to survive? Singaporeans did not grow up in the same sort of protest culture, heck our society was engineered by LKY and PAP to be the ideal Asian society, what do you expect? Singaporeans honestly have much more in common in mindset with PRC than we like to admit, Deng Xiao Ping literally came over to SG as a model for how to lead China's future development, we are the products of a society created for Confucian, Asian values, not one based on Enlightenment principles.. >The difference between HK and us is that we simply don‚Äôt care about the values of democracy as much as they do.

I wouldn't say that Singaporeans don't care about the values of democracy, it's more of the values of democracy being irrelevant to Singaporeans. People are living relatively comfortably and happy with their lot in life, who cares if the PAP stays in power or some rabble-rouser gets arrested. Irrelevance is the reason for the apathy.

If the average Hongkonger lived like the average Singaporean, I'd be surprised if the protests even got off the ground in the first place.. You are viewing this issue from the perspective of an outsider.

The average Hongkonger isn't like the average Singaporean. Their society is heavily stratified with high levels of income inequality. The economy is booming, but all the wealth goes to the people at the top.

Unlike in Singapore, there is limited social mobility, because in the Hong Kong public school system the language of instruction is Cantonese, and the level of Mandarin and English is poor. The graduates have a hard time getting jobs at international law and finance firms.

Only those who can afford it, aka those at the top, can enroll in private international schools. These schools produce the Hongkongers who speak excellent English or Mandarin and are cosmopolitan.

And there's also their housing shortage situation. The average living space for a Hongkonger, taking into account multiple members in a household, is 161 square feet, roughly double that of a prison cell. There is a five year waiting period for public housing, and 50% of Hong Kong's population is squished into 14% of its territory.

Hong Kong actually has a lot of land available for development, but it is all tightly held by the government, corporations, and the Heung Yee Kuk, and property prices are deliberately kept high and construction kept to a minimum to maximise profits at the expense of housing availability for the population.

Most Hongkongers can look forward to exchanging their savings from a double income lifetime of toil for a tiny apartment at exorbitant prices. This is the limit of the Hong Kong dream for most and it breeds anger.

Lastly, and most importantly: **Hongkongers cannot vote their government out of office.** Half of the seats in the Legislative Council are elected by appointed business interests.

This is the situation the majority of Hongkongers are stuck in. They can't vote their government out. Their government is screwing them. The economy is booming, but the benefits only go to the fat cats and the politicians.

It's not their livelihoods and economy that they're destroying. It was never theirs to begin with.. The difference is that Singapore is a sovereign country.. Rioting is something that is rational for people who feel they have nothing left to lose. Other people have described why the situation is so miserable for the young people of Hong Kong.. No, as in it would be like finding out our President has ties to China and is in the process of turning us into a Chinese protectorate. That our politicians are complicit in the process and our elections are rigged. That we have no other option available. What then?. And the way people protested was through voting. It was not violent and effective to a certain extent I guess.. Ideology is also a way for foreign powers to subvert and destabilise rival nations.. As mentioned elsewhere ‚Äúone man one vote‚Äù is in its infancy. The longest continuous system of government seems to be the Republic of Venice. 

Over a thousand years, rule by elite and by historical accounts to the satisfaction of its citizens.

True universal suffrage only really works when you have a cohesive and educated majority middle class.  Otherwise no hard decisions can be made.  You can only have votes on small things (e.g. death penalty or not, 30% tax versus 50% tax, how to plan for retirement) but not fundamental values such as, is religion the primary purpose of the state, is holy war a good thing, or are some people subhuman and should be slaves.. The problem with that statement in your quote is that it forgets to mention the human factor, and just how that affects a rotating rota of leaders that is the democratic system.

Because, let's face it, humans suck. Humans who selfishly want power sucks  even more. And unfortunately, humans who want power tends to get it more often than those who don't, and thus any government with people in it (i.e. ALL governments) will eventually start getting weighed down by these 'people who want power'.

And it is actually easier for these people to get power through a democratic system...

Sure, democracy is also very capable of removing these people a lot easier than other methods of governance (*realize just how corrupt some monarchies or dictatorships can get, and then from there know that there's near-absolutely nothing that can displace that rot short of a revolution and/or a whole lot of heads rolling. China tries, but it's a long, long slog for them too*)... but you have to also realize that eventually the biggest. most populist/powerful parties that vie for governance eventually rot too, and that's when a government based on democracy starts to go downhill pretty quickly.

... and when it reaches a point where you only get a choice between shit and dung and nothing else, you'd realize that this is when corruption in a democratic country is EVEN MORE DIFFICULT to get rid of than any other forms of governance. Simply because there's actually nothing to go revolutionary against (*there's literally no grounds for them to even stand on*), AND it's nigh impossible to form an opposing party simply because any new parties who challenges the status quo will get kicked out by the 'current power' pretty quickly. (*Singaporeans should know this by now. So do Americans and their 'no third party' political landscape*)

Of course, this is the opinion of an armchair politician who doesn't even dare to poke his head out of the tortoise shell, so BBLEG! What do I know!?. > But a well-designed democracy is safer against a malicious or incompetent government than a non-democratic nation.

Citation needed. Democracy in the sense of one-man-one-vote is really young. 1964 for US, roughly after WW2 for UK. Before that nobody actually practiced liberal democracy as we understand it today, because it was legal to restrict large swathes of a nation's population (black people/colonial subjects/women/etc.) from voting.

In comparison, monarchies like Japan and Rome, and theocracies like the Holy See and Mount Athos, have lasted over a millennium. Is liberal democracy really that stable? Are there ways for a bad leader to ruin a liberal democracy from the inside? I'd say it's far too early to tell, but Trump and Johnson are providing plenty of food for thought.. >our Housing and Development Board, which is a product of our democratic system(s)

I had no idea we voted for the HDB. In fact, I'd always thought the move to force people to move from their kampungs into HDB flats was extremely unpopular back in the day.. Did we vote for a HDB policy? Do all democratic countries have public housing policies? Just saying that even China has its own version of public housing. You‚Äôre trying to force a link between democracy and public housing schemes here, which I don‚Äôt quite understand.

I don‚Äôt see why our stands are at odds here. So you‚Äôre essentially agreeing with me that good governance is the key to a successful country? 

And yes I should have clarified. Economic progress is great, but only if the wealth is evenly spread among your people. Clearly, the average HKer did not get an even share of the economic progress pie. 

‚ÄúAnd you prove OP right, Singaporeans today totally don‚Äôt care the same way‚Äù 

Firstly, ‚Äúthe generation that cared‚Äù gave equal emphasis to both economic growth AND social policies. Which again, ties back to my point about good governance being the hallmark of successful countries, not just democracy. 

Secondly, you‚Äôre equating how Singaporeans feel about an external issue with how they will view issues affecting their own people. Really? But the evidence indicates that a growing number of our people (especially the youths) are becoming more politically concerned. You can care for your country and people without empathising with the HK protesters.. Hong Kong is not economically successful with regards to the issue of housing. economics has to do with the efficient allocation of resources. having a disastrous housing market like one in Hong Kong shows a lack of such efficient allocation, at least in that field.

Also, democracy would mean that the actions taken by the government was representative of the people. what you have written: ""leaders who were courageous enough to make tough choices"", implies that the government did what they felt was right instead of what the people wanted. in this scenario the government should be labelled as authoritarian. instead, you labelled them as democratic.. >All the money  in the pocket of people is no fix for the issue. 

The problem is most of the money are in pockets of a few people.. To many liberal, democracy seems like the golden goal to greater good, until they realized that they are the loud minority.

Democracy is basically majority bias, such systems seems like a great idea but you need your citizen to be educated and well informed to make the right decisions.

Just look at reddit, how easy it is to push narrative. Most of the time democracy will be won by who control the education and media.

edit: words. But the question of whether we ‚Äúshould‚Äù be in agreement with HK‚Äôs protests precedes your question of why ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù we relate to HK. 

A lot of Singaporeans will disagree with you at this far more fundamental stage of ‚Äúshould‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcould‚Äù. You trying to engage people on the ‚Äúcould‚Äù argument is going to be fruitless when there is no common ground to even debate on in the first place. 

As an add-on, to any thinking observer (and plenty of pundits) it‚Äôs pretty clear that the 2047 promise was intended to be a window period for HK to assimilate into China, not the other way round. Suggesting that China grants HK MORE freedom at this juncture is simply counter to the intention of the treaty and pretty illogical. Do you really think that HK will agree to give up its democratic freedom in 2047 even if China grants it right now?. I disagree with the empty promise part. Without one country 2 systems, HK wouldn't even have the ability to protest as of right now.. Nope I have not. And anyway MFA has already advised against going to HK. Would be kinda foolhardy to go down just to talk to protesters. 

But why do you ask? 

I was responding to the OP‚Äôs post about the concept of democracy vs economic progress. So I just gave what I thought was a commonsensical answer. I also put in a disclaimer that my point was NOT to comment on the legitimacy of the HK protests.. Ok... so? OP phrased his post as a hypothesis and invited discussion. 

My point is that we value good governance more than democracy because with good governance comes economic progress, which raises overall quality of life for all.. That's an important background something that I feel the above guy probably did not touch on concisely enough.

Singapore has a non-democratic system that *WORKS*.

We have a perfectly fine example of a government who not only isn't democratic, but is also a place where we don't get organs harvested and then sent to a concentration camp.

Ergo, it's hard for us SG guys to completely understand just WHY so many people are utterly going crazy-mad over changing the ENTIRE system of governance, instead of simply working with the government but keeping a close eye on what it's doing. (*to try and change it from within even while making sure it is doing good by the people despite not being democratic*)

Since, you know, the HK system WAS working before, despite Chinese rule. It certainly isn't working now, given how administrators can openly sneer at the leadership during executive meetings.... I believe some of them started doing that to attract outside attention. They want the US to counter China. They don't necessarily want to be US citizens or US rule.. 100% chance those are Chinese government plants to push their narrative that this is CIA meddling in Chinese politics. I can't 100% speak for the older generation (they seem to be vocally anti-protesters), but I see a few main reasons why our opinions differ:

1) The most obvious - Singapore has prospered under authoritarianism. However, I think our brand of authoritarianism is different from that of HK's situation. Still, the older generation, having lived through our Ah Gong's firm but steady hands, don't have much to complain about in retrospect.

2) Time horizon: We emphasize with people of our own generation better. The younger generation are worried about 2047; many older people know they wouldn't live that long.

3) Slippery slope: The younger generation of HK are worried about much more than the extradition law. The way they see it, it's a gradual encroachment. I've discussed this before; the extradition law would have been 99% benevolent - 99% of people extradited would have been criminals HK would have been better off without. It's the 1% potential for misuse that people are worried about. The older generation might not have to worry so much, but younger people who use social media often are at risk. The CCP has disappeared people on the mainland for embarrassing them on social media. 

The Emergency Ordinance is another example. Right now, Carrie Lam has invoked it to ban masks, but the Ordinance can be potentially used in any way possible (see Enabling Act 1933). The older generation might just see the one thing right in front of them, but the younger generation is worried that a sealed can of evil has been opened for potential abuse in the future.

4) Social media biases: The social media surrounding us feeds us information that reinforces our own biases. There's fake news and propaganda from both sides surrounding this issue. I wouldn't be surprised if the (chinese-educated) older generation are fed more propaganda coming directly out of China.

5) Socio-economic differences: There are more business owners among the older generation. Business owners would understand how devastating the protests are to people's livelihoods. Imagine you're running a dimsum restaurant in Causeway Bay, making 10% in profit margin. The protests have wiped out retail business by \~30%. That's *three years'* worth of your livelihood. And I think that's a low estimate. 

You try to explain to the young masked protesters outside that you too are on their side (at least in spirit - perhaps you have joined the early million-man marches in June or gave your workers off-days to attend) but are ignored. You see them overturning trash cans, blocking traffic and spray painting graffiti outside your shop (quite the understatement if you look at what's happening today). How do you feel?

Younger people may not emphasize with this as many of us are serving NS/studying or working for big corporations that we think 'can' take the hit to their bottom line. Many of the older generation (me included) are working and worried about paying bills and can imagine how painful it could get. Is this a worthwhile sacrifice for some perceived ""freedoms"" - when the average HKer is already having a much better life than mainlanders? That's a difficult question to answer.. ... how is that thou? They tried to push a bill through HK's government that'll allow for people to be extradited and tried in China, true...

... but also, **They tried to push a bill** ***through HK's government*****.** They ***WENT THROUGH*** with HK law to try and insert a lawful method of adding laws into HK's books, so a person can be tried first in HK's laws before being subject to China's laws.

I'm not seeing this ""breaking the terms of the contract"". Please explain?. Nope China's renegate on nothing

There is a provision within the basic law dealing with security. China had on multiple occasion extradite criminals to Hong Kong. Hk has not done the same. The extradition law doesn't add to anything that isn't already there. Is more accurate to say it just formalized what already exist

There is also nothing in the basic law that allows for universal suffrage. There is an article that allowed the Hong Kongers to vie for the CE which the Hong Kong govt tried to implement but was hired down by the pro democracy

Finally on the current protest, China has done absolutely jack shit to the protesters. It's all managed by the HKPF

On the other hand HK have so far refuse to implement article 23 and UK is supporting it, it's the UK that is supporting the breaking of basic law. Why would it be better? 

Does change not disenfranchise those who do not agree with the change? Would they meekly accept said change? Would they not instead push back on said change, and swing the proverbial pendulum the other way? 

Winning hearts and minds require a process. No amount of smash and grab tactics will achieve sustainable peaceful change.  The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan should have been clear enough lessons to that effect.. Yep. The issue comes when it's neither quick nor successful.. Actually not really, as long as you were not a communist, the US was more than happy to support you and they knew it even though the rhetoric is another thing. Lol at Western perception 

I wasn't aware there were concentration camps and genocide going on in Singapore.

I also haven't experienced any internet censorship in Singapore. Nor was I followed by a plain clothes officer to monitor me during my visit

The ordinary Chinese isn't free to pursue their livelihood, they are province bound with little freedom to move to a different province.. First paragraph is true. Do you have any evidence to support your claim in the second paragraph? I don't think as many people in Hong Kong read Western media as you imply.. >Which is also why LKY limited western news agencies and western bodies to print and say whatever they want in singapore


Correction: He limited all foreign news agencies and influences. Back then we faced issues from Malaysia and China too.. >The point of democracy is to limit power. Sure there is less stability in policies and planning, however it also prevents massive corruption that is a result of authoritarianism as power is controlled by the few

So you're saying there is great accountability in a democracy, due to the checks and balances in place, and because of people power? This fantasy again sounds good, but is not often true upon examination.

Look to America's Trump. The president is corrupt as ever, from benefitting economically from the presidency, using the position of president to further his business agenda, outright nepotism with the daughter and son-in-law having major government positions they are no where qualified to hold, to openly interfering with federal investigations..yet where is the accountability, even with the great American checks and balances? 

Let's take other countries which are not as developed. Like Duterte in the Philippines. Do you think there's any chance he will be held accountable for his murders in the drug war? Checks and balances can be easily subverted by the party in power, particularly in developing countries where the institutions are not as strong/non-corrupt. 

As for people power, who do you think has more say in determining the outcome of American elections..a hundred thousand people or one man Rupert Murdoch, who through his vast Fox News network, almost single handedly controls the political opinions of half the country? Or a billionaire like Koch, who spends hundreds of millions of dollars on politicians each election season, to spread their agenda? Does a taxi driver in New York have even 1/100th the voice of a Koch brother? Where then is people power? More like oligarch power, is it not?. The way Trump is using his power, does it really prevent mass corruption? I'm pro-democracy but we can see certain democratic systems are clearly not working (and of course most communist systems are not too). Let me repeat my simple question:

What positive attribute are you expecting democracy to bring to HK?. Aiyoh theory vs practice la. In theory the two are not opposed and in practice we've seen pretty unsuccessful cases in the extremes but it's seen success among states that are willing to take the parts that work rather than be fixated on labels.. mate i‚Äôm an anarchist so i don‚Äôt fucking believe in a Lenin‚Äôs idea of democratic communist state either. did you read my post??. Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Checkmate atheists! /s. Maybe it's what they want,?. Facebook comment are really not a good representation of the general population, even reddit too.. Heh Malaysia.

I remember being extremely cynical about Madhatter and I guess I am right. It is frankly in China's interest to maintain HK's autonomy. Its fantastic institutions right at their doorstep end up working in their favor. 

What I can't figure out is *why* they are infringing on HK's autonomy. China behaves a lot like Ledger's Joker. Nothing that they ever do is what it seems. There is always an ulterior motive that is calculated and meticulously planned. 

My theory is that they can sense the nascent democratic (and eventually separatist) movement growing in Hong Kong today. If left totally untouched, it will be an almost impossible task to reintegrate the territory back into PRC after 2047. They're gambling that even with their ""interventions"", enough capital will still be flowing through HK and into China, giving Shanghai enough time to catch up and even surpass HK sometime in the next 10-20 years. 

After that point, all bets are off because what little leverage HK had against the mainland will now be gone come the 2040s, making their reintegration of HK in 2047 easy and seamless.. [deleted]. How is this not violence

watch/?v=515220019211251 - fb link





 I personally classify multiple attempts at trying to kill or seriously injured a law enforcer as violent

  
And this  


> The violent actions of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong last week ticked all the boxes of ‚Äúterrorist acts‚Äù as defined by international and local laws, multiple senior government sources told the *Post*

[]( I don't get why the hate on the #1 craze. We're all free to just chill and not push ourselves at work and enjoy our lives. We aren't obliged to hang out with those that brag about it and talk down on others worse off.
The bulk of people striving will probably help push the economy which in turn elevates everyone's quality of life anyway.. Totally get the ‚Äòbe water‚Äô thing they have going on. 

I think things have gotten sideways too quickly. 

And the police are not using the force they are entitled to. If this protest was to happen in Russia (for example). Thousands would have been shot dead.

Still quite confuse at the whole thing. What 5 demands and all that burning and flames and their Reddit is just 20 of the same post. Can‚Äôt relate after their airport incident. Before that, I‚Äôm quite sympathetic. Now It‚Äôs humorous and a good evening ‚Äòwaste time‚Äô program to watch.. Care is a finite resource though. I spend 10 min a day chanting prayer to Kurds already. Not much time left for other social issues.. Technically you should fuck Trump too ;). The reason why we cannot understand their language is because their predicament is something we do not know of. Their protests have moved from anti-extradition law to that of bread and butter issues, HKers frustrated with their living standards.

Do we have free elections? Yes. Hell this coming election in voting in opposition to oppose the 9% GST, without fear of reprisals.

Do we have freedom of speech? Yes, just not freedom from consequences if you decide to say something without evidence. I can go into the public sphere and say: OP IS A PEDO. Whether you want to sue me or not, is up to you.

Yes sure, we are not able to strike/protest whenever we want to, and that is one thing which I feel can be. We all know HKers think that they are better than Mainland Chinese for the past decades until recently China eclipse them.. The Americans voted in Trump partly because of identity. It doesn't seem impossible, especially just doing it part-time.. Lol they've fought the chinese identity for 20+hrs so it's no surprise they riot for 4 months on the weekends only given their identity superiority. IED already went off around last week next to police car. You cannot categorise all protestors under the umbrella of violence. Those who go to the extremes are condemned by both sides. Honestly, both the protestors and the government cherry-pick extreme examples to justify their viewpoint. To judge all protestors as a violent rioters because of the actions of a few is too hasty. There is a certain amount of distruption caused, but the whole point of civil disobidence is to be civil and protest peacefully. Most protestors are doing that. Classifying them as rioters or terrorists is at best misguided and at worst playing into the hands of the CCP and Carrie Lam's government.

There's also something about hypocrisy to be said, when commenting about the protestors being violent, but not the police.. so its okay for the ""police"" to drag an unarmed protester into an enclosed circle and beat him/her brutally?. It‚Äôs only a small minority that actually destroy stuff. Don‚Äôt forget that there‚Äôs also aggression from the Chinese. A teen protestor got stabbed pretty bad a couple days ago by a Pro Beijing Chinese. There is never a good reason for violence and aggression. Unfortunately, they feel like it‚Äôs necessary for their voices to be heard.. Anyone can hire thugs it doesnt matter their race, and its a cheap way to intimidate people. And it really doesnt address the fact that there is no ""other side"" in the chinese politics. There is no maturity in discussion , Everyone is just silenced or self censoring and thats a whole lot of people self censoring 1.3 billion so who checks on these so called supreme leaders? Even lebron james is toeing the line to preserve his jersey sales in china. The only people speaking out are in hk. As usual usa will just pick easy fruits to put china down so HK is just free pickings, its not like they care either way, if catalonia had oil you will see mr trump there tmr. You cant change history that hk law is written in english its just a result of history and china agreed to that in 1997.. We're not objectively poor if we compare ourselves to the rest of humanity, but we don't. So we have a pretty high expectation of what we consider ""basic needs fulfilled"" (have a home, don't need to worry about bills, can fund kid's education, have savings to go towards retirement each month, etc vs simply have roof over head and not hungry). We're not poor but we *feel* poor, so our priorities remain stuck on the lower rungs of the hierarchy.

Most of the HK protesters are younger people anyway, the younger generations tend to feel higher up the hierarchy because they a) are living off the fruits of their parents' labour, or b) haven't fully grasped how tough it is to eke out a good living in the working world. If China tried to pull similar shit in SG, pretty sure our youths will be equally unhappy... although whether they dare to protest or not is another matter altogether.. > Singapore leader also became a rare international figure who condemned HongKong protesters.

You have a source on this? Because Lee Hsien Loong's comments were very much bipartisan and non-biased. I suggest you evaluate his words logically instead of emotionally. Or is it those who want to voice support for HK are scared for their own futures? The CCP is watching.. > privilage

Check your privilege.

^^^BEEP ^^^BOOP ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^to ^^^contact ^^^my ^^^author.. So Hong Kong is a mostly renter economy?

It makes sense then, this is more of a class crisis than the nonsense ideological war people are trying to make this.  The last cry for help by people left behind by globalism in their own home city.. >Hong Kong actually has a lot of land available for development, but it is all tightly held by the government, corporations, and the Heung Yee Kuk, and property prices are deliberately kept high and construction kept to a minimum to maximise profits at the expense of housing availability for the population.

IIRC, when Tung Chee Hwa was CE, he wanted to start a massive housing reforms. However, opposition from the property developers who were in the legco, Asian Financial Crisis and I believe some of the pro-democracy people who just wanted to oppose Tung since he was appointed by CCP.. >161 square metres

That's delicious and humongous! Might you mean 161 square feet?. And that bill is the spark that ignited all that fuel that has been accumulated over the decades.. Sounds like Singapore. Economy is booming, yet all the money goes back to the rich!. Incorrect categorisation.. Protest, sure, but even in that scenario I don't see how it would justify setting things on fire, looting stores or beating up all the PRCs we can find.

edit: I'm honestly interested in clarification on this issue, because it's not something I dare talk about with friends IRL. But I've been getting a lot of secondhand whatsapp outrage from my parents / colleagues about what the protestors are doing, and it's causing a lot of uncomfortable cognitive dissonance because my social circle is mostly liberal and I have trouble seeing all that mob violence as a good thing.. I was actually referring to this

&#x200B;

[]( >... and when it reaches a point where you only get a choice between shit and dung and nothing else, you'd realize that this is when corruption in a democratic country is EVEN MORE DIFFICULT to get rid of than any other forms of governance. Simply because there's actually nothing to go revolutionary against (there's literally no grounds for them to even stand on), AND it's nigh impossible to form an opposing party simply because any new parties who challenges the status quo will get kicked out by the 'current power' pretty quickly. (Singaporeans should know this by now. So do Americans and their 'no third party' political landscape)


Wait. How exactly is this more difficult? Plenty of democracies have revolts, theres several going on right now.. The monarchy in Japan didn't hold much power between the Heian period and the Meiji Restoration (hence ""Restoration"").

Conceptually it was more similar to a modern constitutional monarchy, apart from the fact that the shogun won power through conquest and civil war, not through elections.. Oh wow, for once I‚Äôm letting my inner libtard come out.




To observe a nation‚Äôs wellbeing based on how long it has lasted is a flawed statement - a government‚Äôs priority, in the best scenario, is to make life as good as possible for the people it rules, and to do it through whatever means are best. Whether a nation *lasts* is a different matter entirely - the United Kingdom is well known for being a long-lasting nation, but the disparity of wealth between the upper and lower classes in those periods is beyond anything we can think of now. While many factors play into this, the direct correlation that can be drawn is that Democracy simulates human prosperity, through a variety of matters behind and due to democracy. 






History has provided its fair share of tyrants in the form of kings and leaders. While monarchy could have been sustained before, Technology and increases in communication capability make authoritarian leadership no longer a viable solution for creating the best circumstances.





Of course, China could be considered an exception to the rule - except technology development in China making them best suited for authoritarian use isn‚Äôt for the direct benefit of the people, its for the benefit of the party to be in power. Whether the party helps the population, the fact that the party has to restrict technology in certain ways detrimental to the population does make the case incredibly concerning for them as ruling for the people.. Whaat?   


Yes, true universal suffrage is fairly young. But Liberal Democracy is not just 'universal suffrage'. Liberal Democracy would include the independent branches of government that distribute power and check each other's use of power. It is includes the codification of fundamental human rights that the government recognises. It includes the idea that a government derives its power from the popular mandate that is to ascertain with free and fair elections. The US federal government has had most of these feature, flawed as their implementation may be, since 1780. Most of the states had a majority of these features from well before that. The UK has had parliamentary supremacy over the monarchy and elected representatives since 1689.  ( Also the UK has had universal suffrage since 1928, not 1945)  


There have been all sorts of restrictions and games played to prevent poor people, women and a racial minorities from voting. These restrictions did not exist because the people advocating for them thought that democracy would fail without them or because they believed that there a magical line where too much democracy would result in disaster. They existed because people are selfish and don't like sharing or being subject electoral power. This is all the more reason for universal suffrage.   


We get it. Democracy has been a work in progress. You want to use these misadventures to discredit liberal in favor of an authoritarian alternative that you prefer but won't openly state. And no, running a country does not compare with running some bullshit religious sect. Here is the thing, if you want to use this standard, autocracy has already been thoroughly discredited. I think the biggest virtue of democracy is that it helps a nation to avoid the most destructive types of power struggle and of internal conflict over national policy. Since the we are talking China, in the short period since the US has had Universal suffrage ( 1964), China has had so many disasters directly tied to violence and factionalism that came from the transition of power and change in national economic policy. I would consider Tiananmen, cultural revolution, the down to the countryside movement an so on as examples of this.  If we expand our timeline to 1780, China by comparison has had multiple civil wars, revolutions and internal atrocities with deaths approaching or even exceeding the hundred million people range. The Taiping rebellion alone killed 30-70 million people.--Life is so cheap in autocratic China that we can't even get an estimate to the closest 10 million. More people have died in China's power struggles than in World war 1 and world war 2 by severalfold.   


You realize that the result of all this is that by the time 1984 rolled around, the average PRC citizen had a lower per capita GDP than a citizen of Ethiopia.--the country with the swollen bellies and dead kids. We talk about how the CCP has lifted so many out of poverty, but we forget how these people got into poverty in the first place.. I thought the same as well. Even my parents and grandparents believed they were forced from kampungs, but think it was the right decision in the long run.

If anything, our HDB is a product because our leaders didn't ask for our opinion.. >economics has to do with the efficient allocation of resources. having a disastrous housing market like one in Hong Kong shows a lack of such efficient allocation, at least in that field.

lol

Actually, valuing a 'coffin apartment' at $2million HKD represents an extremely efficient allocation of economic resources (which seller doesn't like a high price per sq ft?). That's part of why Hong Kong is struggling to fix it.

>Also, democracy would mean that the actions taken by the government was representative of the people.

[\_(politics)]( Right now is just bj asking hk to wipe their ass by themselves, truly  one country 2 system. 
But i realised that hk had always emphasising on 2 system instead of one country.. I'm in HK, and absolutely no one thinks this is an economic protest, look at the 5 demands, not one of them is about economics or economic progress.. totally agree. but i personally don't agree on the democratic/autocratic dichotomy. imo it should be viewed as a spectrum than anything else. we're pretty democratic in some ways, pretty undemocratic in other ways. 

also, fun fact @ the person you replied to, china once upon a time looked to singapore to try and save themselves from the ""economic progress eventually leads to political liberalisation"" theory.. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...

Anyways I saw your deleted comment, I‚Äôm not sure how lead-lined and pollution smoke isn‚Äôt a concern in China, where they feed your children milk laced with plastic and have the capital city so polluted you have to wear a mask everywhere.. As a matter of facts, the CIA is meddling in China's politics, and using Hong Kong as a token.
And the CCP is also meddling in US politics, and using Hong Kong as a token.
Welcome to reality, countries spy on each other and disrupt each other's political landscape.

The real question is when Hong Kongers will understand they're just tokens being played by both sides, and start fighting against those who really control the city and robbed them of their future.
People should be fighting crony capitalism, real estate magnates and corruption instead of using this anti-china narrative as a scapegoat.. 100k signatures, people in front line waving American flags and calling for aid from the US...

Nah mate, not everything that doesn't fit one's narrative is a conspiracy by the CCP, although they're definitely not the good guys either.. Thanks for the analysis, never thought of the older gen pov in such detail. Btw, it's *emphathize* not *emphasize* (""place emphasis"").. Thanks for insightful answer, especially for me who barely know much about the whole situation, bet you took quite a while crafting it.. From what I know, the extradition bill they were trying to push through goes against the [Sino-British Joint Declaration]( that China signed with the UK as part of Hong Kong's return to them.

That Declaration guaranteed certain freedoms and rights to Hong Kong until the year 2047, but China declared that because the Declaration is 20 years old, [it is now ""historical"" and holds no legal relevance]( Abu Gharib and Guantanamo bay exists.

US has waged a war against radical islam since bush senior. A campaign of bombs ,bullets and blood for 3 decades killing and displacing millions. Ask an American Indian living in a reservation camp how he feels about his life and history.

Again the US imprisons at a rate of 7 to 1 more prisoners per capita than China , in for profit prisons , mostly blacks and non-whites. 

Ask a black person in the US if he feels equal and free. Also a history of slavery , jim crow laws, through to MLK and black lives matter movement today.

China has internet censorship yes. But it also has high internet penetration. Censorship can be overcome with a 5sgd VPN. 

Ordinary Chinese like citizens everywhere else - it's about money. If you can afford it then you can move elsewhere freely. There are no ID checks between province borders (they check your bags instead) and you can take train pretty much anywhere you want as long as you can afford it . They have the largest human migration during CNY. Though if you want to work in the big city, you need to get a work permit, some controls exist but they aren't 'province bound with little freedom to move' at all.

Your perception and impression of china is based on fear and bias more than the truth. The fact that you use these words concentration camps and genocide reveals your bias. You associate it with the Nazi camps and the Holocaust. 

You know what border xinjiang shares ? Afghanistan .

 Read the wiki on the conflict in xinjiang (  ) The belligerents are proper radical Islamists including Al-Qaeda.  China solves the problem of radical islam through education camps where they house military aged males. The west solves it through a 3 decade long war. 

Source: worked in China 2 years. It does help if you speak the language and am able to read mandarin. 

 Before that I thought about china the same way you did. That it was a North Korean like communist totalitarian shitnhole. But really it is a one party meritocratic technocratic plutocracy. Ordinary PR Chinese are all very happy and satisfied with how things are in China.

Edit: Right . Downvote a factual, objective ,reason based response because it doesn't fit your ideological narrative. Right.. Not really an 'evidence' but this speech by LKY in the US about free press illustrates how media has been used, treated, and handled in in HK (and Singapore). 



You must understand that the international press and journalists in HK have their own biases and agendas (that are political or ideologically in nature ) that are often not for the benefit of the society they are in.

It's a short clip but if you have time you should watch the full clip. In the longer clip, A US senator then accuses LKY of being a dictator as well. And Singapore has been accused of being totalitarian for as long as it existed not disimilar to hashtag chinazi claims today in HK.. You're not wrong in that both systems of governance are flawed.

The argument I think is that in even in an oligarchy you're more likely to get some degree of benevolence, as opposed to a pure dictatorship where there's 0 checks and balances. Even infighting within oligarchs, as stupid as it sounds is a small form of security.  


Singapore has benefited greatly from having the perks of having a benevolent government which genuinely looks out for the people, but is that guaranteed? Is that a coincidence? It's hard to really pin down why our government hasn't\* ended up corrupt yet. It may be purely luck or circumstance even! You're not wrong in that no one form of governance guarantees a benevolent government.. >Look to America's Trump. The president is corrupt as ever, from benefitting economically from the presidency, using the position of president to further his business agenda, outright nepotism with the daughter and son-in-law having major government positions they are no where qualified to hold, to openly interfering with federal investigations..yet where is the accountability, even with the great American checks and balances?


1) Thats why there is a massive investigation going on.
2) This situation is the main reason why there are term limits.


>Let's take other countries which are not as developed. Like Duterte in the Philippines. Do you think there's any chance he will be held accountable for his murders in the drug war? Checks and balances can be easily subverted by the party in power, particularly in developing countries where the institutions are not as strong/non-corrupt.


Same as before theres a reason why there are term limits. 


>As for people power, who do you think has more say in determining the outcome of American elections..a hundred thousand people or one man Rupert Murdoch, who through his vast Fox News network, almost single handedly controls the political opinions of half the country?

Does a taxi driver in New York have even 1/100th the voice of a Koch brother? Where then is people power? More like oligarch power, is it not?



All this while you have been attacking all the weak points of democracy. Can i ask what system are you infering is better? China's system at every single point here it would be worse. There will always be pros and cons. Whats the point in simply focusing on the cons of an idealogy to dismiss it if you dont have a better system?


>So tell me, before you shame me into buying a pitchfork, a black mask and some spray paint, tell me what exactly this great gift of Democracy from the West is supposed to give me?


Tell me how in the world is China's system better.. Yes it does. Term limit. What other system do you suggest can combat this issue?


The alternative they face is China's System. Is it any better? Corruption is rampant.. Does it matter if that's what HKers want and were promised to an extent?. what unsuccessful case of extreme democracy is there?. >Lenin interprets communism as the only true way of achieving perfect democracy, as opposed to parliamentary democracy which is inherently flawed.

democracy means any party or ideology is acceptable not just communism, lenin's ""interpretation""  is just BS. democracy is opposed to communism, which demands only 1 communist ideology.. North korea, best korea. Heath Ledger's Joker does not actually have a plan.  Come to think of the the last few month, I really don't think China has one either.

# ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like a dog chasing cars, I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do if I caught one, you know, I just do‚Ä¶things.‚Äù. Alfred was right, some men just wants to see the world burn.. They were ok with the autonomy in general but would like some parts which are not autonomous. Which in this case is the extradition treaty, without which people can simply just run and hide in hk. Even countries have lots of extradition treaties with each other, so it doesn't make sense that China can't do it from one of its provinces. 

Apparently Carrie lam knew China wanted this treaty and on her own initiative proposed it to her higher ups and started the process, thinking the hk people will accept it. Lol typical mid level management over promising to the boss and can't deliver. Then HK people need to stay in /r/HongKong and leave places like /r/Singapore alone.

Because if this is all just catharsis, the rioters don't need Singapore's support or approval.

If this isn't just catharsis, and instead is a search for legitimacy (or a 'notice me sempai' move), then too bad - you're going to get people like me who plainly don't agree with how the riots have progressed because it's entirely counterproductive and *wrong*.

Because those who are still emotional cannot understand that *the absolute imperative is to ensure that there's still a Hong Kong tomorrow*. And that requires a deep soul searching and recalibration of tactics to allow everyone to deescalate and move towards problem solving.

Continuing to do what is being done accelerates the path towards there being *no* Hong Kong tomorrow. 

But go ahead, vent. Because catharsis, amirite?. I won't be responding further to individuals like yourself... but I'm going to lay this out there so others can judge for themselves. 

Looking at the 6 out of your 7 posts in an account that's 9 mths old makes it hard to believe you aren't driving an agenda here. The same can be said for most of your previous comments. Or are you simply farming karma to post in various subreddits?

Now back to your comment here on being disappointed. Where does that disappointment stem from?

Whilst I agree that it's totally fine to discuss and debate, we need to be mindful that individuals like yourself and OP are not driven by a single agenda that could mislead, or misinform the general public. 

Last but not least, are you sure that's the true majority voice of the citizens in HK? Or simply the minority  making the most noise?. Apologies.. there is violence which I clearly do not agree with. Please refer to my edited post on that last sentence. It should be clearer.. Apologies.. I had 2 perspectives here and did not capture them correctly in the last part of my previous post.

There is violence and I definitely condemn that.. now the violence however is mostly instigated from the protestors' perspective, rather than the law enforcers. 

The second perspective I was trying to capture here was that the ongoing protests in HK are relatively tame compared to the rest of the world. There is obviously an underlying reason for that.. Because the #1 craze isn't merely a craze but a national agenda that invariably affects every part of our daily lives. For instance, maybe if we're weren't so obsessed with maximizing growth and were more okay with a more sustainable model (idk how that might look like, just hypothesizing) then our workplace culture wouldn't be as draining and dissatisfying as it is. (See at least two threads that have popped up here over the past week.). Which airport incident are you talking about?. Thankfully Jesus is infinite. I don't have to chant he already know.. I will let r/HK produce some concrete evidence before making conclusions. I find it odd that his pals still can take few nice photos before even considering giving him first aid.

If you ask me the China great firewall question abt a decade ago least, I would have readily agreed with you. Sure overtly disagreeing with the government is not really going to happen anytime soon. It is quite interesting when u see wall jumpers going at it and even internally net users are capable of using very creative ways to circumvent the systems. You got policy, I got contingencies... (shang you zhen ce, xia you dui ce)

you should not get folks constantly saying things in support of the CCP unless they are CCP party members. Even then the system is very horizontal in it's actions. Unity and keeping course of the Chinese renaissance is more of what the current PRC is chasing after. Political opening up will work better for them when the basic lives of the common ppl are met. I for sure do not agree with putting the cart before the horse here.. He said Hong Kong protesters were trying to ‚Äòhumiliate‚Äô the government rather than solve problems. Tell me, in what way it is not a negative comment? I do welcome healthy discussion on the matter 


 I've not come across any statistics about rent, but yeah, the protests (at least in the beginning and also in 2014) are largely due to frustration and dissatisfaction.. That is absolutely correct. The unrest is, first and foremost, borne out of an insurmountable class divide - contrary to the piles of shit churned out by the western media on HK. Whoops!

Fixed, ty.. Singapore has a middle class which is getting wealthier even though it‚Äôs not at the same rate as the truly well to do.. You cannot categorise all protestors under the umbrella of violence. Those who go to the extremes are condemned by both sides. Honestly, both HKers and the government cherry-pick extreme examples to justify their viewpoint. To judge all protestors as a violent mob because of the actions of a few is too hasty. There is a certain amount of distruption caused, but the whole point of civil disobidence is to be civil and protest peacefully. Most HKers are doing that. Believing that HK is a lawless wasteland is at best misguided and at worst playing into the hands of PRC and the HK government.. Are you talking about a true democracy, or the sort of 'democracy' that SG is accused of? Because one of those is a lot harder to find popular support for than the other.. question - do libtards believe in utilitarianism?. >It includes the idea that a government derives its power from the popular mandate that is to ascertain with free and fair elections.

Which is incompatible with the idea that large swathes of the population can be restricted from voting.

Tell me, was the Holy Roman Empire a liberal democracy because 7 Electors chose the emperor? Is the Holy See a liberal democracy because ~200 cardinals elect the Pope?

If not, then why would Britain circa 1950 count as a liberal democracy when the vast majority of people living in the British Empire (India, Singapore, other colonies) couldn't vote?

>The UK has had parliamentary supremacy over the monarchy and elected representatives since 1689. ( Also the UK has had universal suffrage since 1928, not 1945)

In theory yes, but ""universal"" as of 1928 conveniently left out colonial subjects. A legal fiction. You may recall that this is why David Marshall/LKY/Gandhi/etc. campaigned for independence in the first place. 

>You want to use these misadventures to discredit liberal in favor of an authoritarian alternative that you prefer but won't openly state.

Now this is just strawmanning and arguing in bad faith. I don't support any particular system in general because they're all flawed, but I support Singaporean democracy here because it's the law currently.

> Since the we are talking China, in the short period since the US has had Universal suffrage ( 1964), China has had so many disasters directly tied to violence and factionalism that came from the transition of power and change in national economic policy.

I agree that oligarchic/autocractic rule has caused plenty of disasters in China. I just don't see how protesting/rioting democracy in HK is supposed to stop future disasters.. not sure how the example you listed is economically efficient. maybe we have different definitions? the definition i used is commonly accepted in the economics community and is along these lines: ""Economic efficiency is when every scarce resource in an economy is used and distributed among producers and consumers in a way that produces the most economic output and benefit to consumers.""

also, you linked a wikipedia page about mandate? which simply puts means the right to rule of the populace. democratic or autocratic regimes can have legitimate mandates. does not dispute my point about democracy made earlier.. Well I'm not in HK, but that's not what my pro-protester friends in HK are saying. The economic situation is definitely a factor in their anti-China sentiment.. A paper analysing a chronological timeline of the protests, government and political response, and police and protester tactics, written by a British former Hong Kong police officer currently residing in Hong Kong.

He's alluded to economical issues as a one of the underlying drivers behind the protests. So I woulnd't say ""absolutely no one"" thinks this isn't tied to economic and social issues.



> That protests have been so widespread with support across diverse sections of society, so sustained for over four months, resulted in so much violence as well as hatred, shows that the Bill was only a trigger based on far wider social discontent.

> ... there are underlying problems in Hong Kong that have not been addressed by the local Government. There is considerable worsening economic disparity, with a growing low-income section of society not benefiting from the economic growth of the city.. You‚Äôre absolutely certain that not a single protester thinks that economic concerns are an underlying cause of the protests?. Simply because those issues has NOTHING to do with democracy, dictatorship or whatever rat-based governance you have...

Shit happens and people in power profit while trying to hide it. Crappy leadership 101.

(Edit PS: ""capital city so polluted you have to wear a mask everywhere""... guess where the goods that produced the pollution goes to. Those places sure isn't as polluted...). The most polluted cities in the world are in India, a democracy. Democracy isn't some magic pill that cures all. What really matters is that the people at the top are benevolent.. Pollution = to non-democracy? What are you smoking.

Take a look at this top 10.

 I agree, and I think the protests were (sadly) doomed to be hijacked from the start. A popular movement with no clear leader is just begging to be bandwagoned by bad actors and manipulated by external forces into something totally different from its non-violent origins. Eh pushing for extradition law has nothing to do with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, in fact it makes sense because HK is a place for criminals to run to if they commit crimes in China, Macau and Taiwan.

The issue that the protesters are unhappy about is that China doesn't have the concept of rule of law, but they rule by law.. The establishment of an extradition arrangement is a sovereign act.

The acquiescence to an extradition process is a recognition of another's sovereignty.

The establishment of a formal system takes apart any legal justification that a disappearence may have (say, for example, that one is just exercising proper police powers within one's territory).

Legally, the Extradition Bill is in line with the '97 treaty. In fact, the Bill entrenches the ""two systems"" part of the equation.

Yet it is rejected on the grounds that it's an overreach by China. 

The rioters claim to want independence on one hand, yet wave another's flag in the other.

The rioters claim to want China to honour the '97 agreement, but ignore how the' 97 agreement would be irrevocably changed by their 5 demands.

The rioters claim to want the rule of law, yet insist on self-serving demands to have the law disapplied to them.

Has logic prevailed? I think not. 

I say this with, as a *Singaporean*, no love for China - if the rioters truly believe in how right they are, the opinion of ~6m people is irrelevant. They don't need us to tell them how right they are.. Lol you clearly don't know anything. The premise of the treaty was that a HKer killed his pregnant gf in Taiwan and took a ship back to HK. Because of the lack of extradition treaty between TW, Macau and China only (there was already an extradition bill in place covering other countries, British legacy stuff). HK (and some says requested by China) wants to add China, Taiwan and Macau to the extradition treaty list, gets bashed. 

As for the declaration, UK was pointing to it as justification for UK to get involved in the HK riots. The point China made is that UK no longer should have influence over HK's sovereignty, but people twist it around to say China is dropping one country two system. If that's really the case how come anti-China text books are taught in HK over the last 20+ years? It's okay if we have different views but maybe do our homework so we actually know what we're standing for beyond the sensational headlines.. Oh I agree, I don't see authoritarian governments as being guaranteed to work either (and this is a discussion for another day, but I don't think what we have in SG can be described as an authoritarian government). What I do know is that democracy is no panacea, and honestly not an improvement over existing systems of rule we have and have had in the East, despite the baseless rhetoric propagated by the west.. China's system is better... For the leaders to bleed their people dry.. Oh man the world is a shitshow. IIRC Xi removed the term limits but what was it before? Corruption is rampant across all countries though, not just China.. Of course it matters. 

If you are unable to clearly describe a positive aspect which democracy is meant to bring to these HKers, then why are you asking others to support it?

Would you cajole someone to buy a black box when you are not sure if there is gold or a steaming pile of shit inside?. you know you've lost when you can't even answer a simple question. depends on the factor that you are looking at. If you are only asking if power changes hands and got civil war or not. If we look at good governance resulting from it, recent history has not been encouraging.. dude i‚Äôve obviously left out lenin‚Äôs justification because i don‚Äôt want to type out one third of state and revolution. if you accept lenin‚Äôs premises (which i don‚Äôt), his point makes perfect sense. 

also why are you approaching me with this half-baked theoretical nonsense when i told you i‚Äôm an anarchist that doesn‚Äôt even agree with lenin? go tell your friends about your magnificent and misguided rebuttal or something.. The HK SAR already has extradition treaties with many territories but there are gaps. The gaps are the mainland, Macau SAR aaaaannnnnnnddddd Taiwan. Now remember that Beijing insists that Taiwan is a renegade state/province.

The trigger of the anti-fugitive law? A Hong Kong couple went to Taiwan for an holiday. The guy decides to murder his pregnant SO there, packed her body into a luggage bag, dumped the body in a river, took a flight back to HK. The HK Police found the guy to have stolen his partner's credit card. So he was charged for it and was jailed for it. He is almost done serving his 28/29 mth sentence. Recently, there is a report stating that after his baptism, he wishes to go to TW, turn himself in and stand trial. Guess what the COUNTRY that the murder take place in is trying to do? They want to say No! A democratic COUNTRY does not want to serve the justice that is owed to the parents of the victim. To add some salt onto their wounds, students of the school that the victim even attended the ""anti send back China"" protests..... National agenda? When did the government say that we should always be #1?. Airport being shutdown due to protest and chinese reporter getting beaten up because he speaks chinese, whats more fucked up is that they went to search his bag and use his credit card to purchase stuff for themselves.. Crippled airport operation delay flight. Yeah but human time still finite. Gotta care for the Kurds, the minority blackface, sgsecure ns boys, korean pop star suicides, HK rioters, esports.. I think it is important to note that being critical of the protesters does not equate to support for the Chinese government. It is not a zero sum game. And indeed, LHL has not made any statements in support of the CCP.

With that out of the way, we have to look at the situation logically. For instance, the protesters are putting up 5 demands, one of which includes full pardoning of all protestors.  Regardless of your stance on the CCP (I myself am quite repulsive of them), we have to acknowledge that this will be humiliating for the CCP because it would signify that the CCP is no longer in power, which the CCP will never allow to happen. 

So by including this as one of the 5 major demands, it is, in essence, trying to humiliate the CCP instead of trying to solve the underlying issues.

At the end of the day, what LHL is saying (or implying) s that both sides have to make compromises and come to an agreement, instead of insisting on their own point of view. And you can see this from the way he criticized the acting HK govt as well, pointing out their weak policies and failure to solve socio-economical issues. If the rioters had any integrity, they would willingly submit themselves to the full extent of the law after they achieve their more laudable goals. Instead, they are asking for the laws to be disapplied to them.

How is this not making a mockery of the rule of law? How is that acceptable to *any sensible government*?

And what guarantee is on the table that there won't be a 6th, 7th or 8th demand after the 5? Would it be another case of too little too late?

How does a government negotiate? Is this not a case of yield to a tantrum and embarrass your parent for not having control over you?. Well ya I do think that the demands (some of them) and the unwillingness to compromise is designed to humiliate the government and possibly bring it down. Is that wrong?

I mean isn't that the protestors'/rioters' strategy?. That makes the yellow peril/prondemocracy hand wringing here in the US seem like a distraction from impeachment.  Timing is very suspicious since these protests have been going for a while.. Yup, I don't judge all protestors as violent (especially when the police and counter-protestors have been just as violent), and specifically meant the violent ones. There are hundreds of those, though.. > Those who go to the extremes are condemned by both sides. 

Hmm really? Isn't the policy to support each other even if you disagree with the violence? Given that the whole movement is supposedly leaderless and there are no clear factions or leaders condemning the violence (heck some politicians even supported it or somehow defended the violence), it extremely hard to separate those who are violent and those who are not.

  
You can't have your cake and eat it and suddenly decide when is it good to support or not support the violent rioters.. Had to look that up to be sure I won‚Äôt be going out of topic, haha.






My opinion is that, in concept, Libtards believe in utilitarianism to a some extent - punishing the minority for the aid of the majority poor, maximising the pleasure of the population as a whole. Again, however, Utilitarianism is a concept that has its flaws, and the apparent wish for ‚ÄúJustice above all‚Äù would go against it. 





Then again we must remember that this is *apparent* - Libtards are about as happy to accuse and abhor a target that other similar Libtards have a hatred for (a.k.a circlejerking) even without the understanding of the concepts or the true story behind it, and are willing to sacrifice their ideals if it means they have personal satisfaction (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt support the death penalty but I wish he was fucking dead‚Äù syndrome anyone?). So, to an ironic extent, even if they don‚Äôt support utilitarianism, they probably uphold its ideals as closest as we will see in our society.. I observe that your conundrum would be far simpler if you had bothered to read my comment. The Holy Roman empire does not count, because, no parliament, no independent institutions etc etc. Also if you think that an election composed of just 7 guys is even broadly the equivalent to the early US elections that where 10% of the population or about 2 million people, were eligible to vote, I think the person working in bad faith is you. 

The UK functioned as a liberal democracy domestically. The colonies of the UK were never legally a part of the UK.-- You may want to look this up. This is because the UK wished to keep its colonies subjugated and knew that bringing too many elements of liberal democracy to them would make it easier for them to set themselves free. Yet another argument in its favor.. I'm really tired of explaining this to people. Go read up where the hong kong government get its revenue from, and why land for their public housing is limited, their incentive structure(s), the interests involved, and why despite the clear housing crisis, other priorities still get in the way. Hint: it's something to do with the economic output

>autocratic regimes can have legitimate mandates

no.

>does not dispute my point about democracy made earlier.

what is it about people voting for a party and their platform, giving them the mandate, and then executing on their manifesto when they form government, do you not get?

when I said ""leaders who were courageous enough to make tough choices"", I was referring to their platform - which included public housing - and execution.. These those pro-protester friends of yours can go protest about income inequality or the housing crisis.  The housing crisis is directly caused by the HK gov't anyway.. I mean to say, no local protester thinks this is an economic protest. Excluding British former Hong Kong police officers and outsiders. Have you seen a single banner about economic reforms?. I know the background of why the bill was proposed. It doesn't matter why the bill was proposed, the fact is the bill *goes against the signed treaty.* When you sign an agreement, you must follow it or pay the price for breaking it. It doesn't matter what reasons or excuses you come up with. If anyone can just cook up some random excuse and ignore signed agreements, all agreements will lose their value.

You also cannot deny or avoid the fact that bill or not, China outright declared that they will not honour a contract they signed. If the bill does not contravene the terms of the declaration, there would have been no need for China to make such a statement.

I'm not sure who's the one who doesn't know anything. You're obviously making a stance based on bias rather than facts.. Can i ask what existing systems of rule are you referring to that did not originate from the west? And is better at dealing with the problems you have identified.. Thats why i dont understand his arguement, all the attacks he has on democracy wont be solved by china's system either.. A more apt analogy might be this: 

Someone had a black box with gold inside, and then it was taken away from them. A red box was then handed to them, and they're told that it's gold inside. There's no easy of knowing for sure because it's locked and will only open in 28 years. Would you tell them to just be happy they've got a box, even if you don't know what's inside? Or would you be more empathetic about them doing whatever they can to get the black box back?. Its an easy question tbh when the only alternative is the CCP.. 1) it's not a competition or a debate 
2) it looks like a simple question but it's really a lot more complex than you're giving it credit for. can you site any scientific literature? for both civil war and good governance. I'm just saying democracy is opposed to communism, your other points i agree with, but that one point just takes the cake.. You missed out imran and dominic. I only said he‚Äôs just critical of the protesters. I never tried to imply LHL supported CCP

As for the 5 demands, I think you are over emphasising on the amnesty one. For your information, this demand was made early in July, way before the protesters escalated their actions. It was more targeted against unreasonable prosecutions, e.g. those charged with rioting without having committed any violent act.. those who simply showed up at the wrong place at the wrong time. I don‚Äôt think the majority society would complain a lot if the government pressed charges against the radical kids setting fire at shop fronts.

In fact,  the setting up of independent investigation panel is much higher up on the 5 demands. If the HK government had agreed to that early on, say like in August, I can guarantee you at least 1/2 of the ‚Äúyellow ribbons‚Äù would stop coming out. 

It has been a top demand from day 1. People don‚Äôt trust for the cases of police abuse to be handled by current mechanism, as the Independent Police Complaints Council, IPCC, is deemed almost powerless, and was controlled by mostly pro-government figures. They want a judge-led panel, with power to summon evidence and witnesses.

It was even backed a number of pro-establishment figures. Many wanted an investigation to find out the ‚Äúblack hand‚Äù of all these protest actions.

I no longer live in Hong Kong so I totally understand how difficult it is to understand the dynamics of the protest. What you see on news gives you pieces in the puzzle, but can never give you the whole picture.

I‚Äôd explain more if you want.. Good point, I honestly think the HK protest suffers from the lack of clear leadership, most successful protest have clear figures and command structures that allow for some sort of negotiation and organisation within the protest, I have not seen a Martin Luther Jr. or Mandela like figure emerge though.. > I observe that your conundrum would be far simpler if you had bothered to read my comment. The Holy Roman empire does not count, because, no parliament, no independent institutions etc etc. Also if you think that an election composed of just 7 guys is even broadly the equivalent to the early US elections that where 10% of the population or about 2 million people, were eligible to vote, I think the person working in bad faith is you.

Ok, I'll give you this one. But answer this: if the government tomorrow declared that 90% of Singaporeans became ineligible to vote (say based on income), but Parliament and the Courts were preserved, you'd still say we're democratic and well-represented?

>The UK functioned as a liberal democracy domestically. The colonies of the UK were never legally a part of the UK.-- You may want to look this up. This is because the UK wished to keep its colonies subjugated and knew that bringing too many elements of liberal democracy to them would make it easier for them to set themselves free. Yet another argument in its favor.

A ""liberal democracy"" that's economically dependent on a larger populace of non-voting colonial subjects sounds neither liberal nor democratic to me.

But ok, let's say I give you this one too. So now Britain has been a liberal democracy since 1928, not ~1950. It's still not even a century old. Far too young to determine if liberal democracy is stable, or if its checks and balances can reject terrible leaders in the long run.. tited of explaining what? im not contesting you on whether public housing in hk is messed up. it is not economically efficent...

'no.' this is the kind response that people give when they don't know what to say. mandates are not legitimate solely based on votes. there are other ways in which mandates can be legitimate (e.g. appeal to character, historical context). sure, having rational-legal means to have a legitimate mandate seems to be the most just, but that does not invalidate other ways of obtaining the mandate over a state.

~~again, you have not refuted my point.~~ i get what you're saying with regards to ""people voting, mandate, execution..."". that is essentially what a democracy is. in that case, whatever that is stated in their manifesto would not have been a tough choice (e.g. housing policy). tough to execute would have probably been better suited? 

the things im saying come from my knowledge as a economics and political science undergraduate. not saying that im way qualified to talk about these kinds of issues, just letting you know what my information is based off.

all three of your comments with regards to this thread  made little sense to me and thats why i found it difficult to engage with you.. I think you need to understand the difference between a catalyst and underlying contributing factors.

The economic reasons are an underlying factor. Would the protest be that large if the young people can see a future in Hong Kong and have decent housing etc?

They will be less unhappy and less motivated to go onto the streets.

No large scale protest in history didn't have an economic factor that contributed to unhappiness among the people.. Here's the thing thou:  ""In accordance with the ""[one country, two systems](,_two_systems)"" principle agreed between the UK and the PRC, the socialist system of PRC would not be practised in the Hong Kong [Special Administrative Region]( (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years until 2047.""

That's the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, as described in the Wiki.

How does attempting to push an *EXTRADITION TREATY* deny Hong Kong their own administrative individuality?

&#x200B;

Edit: let's not mince words; at this point IMO it is clear that the law trying to be passed that is the cause of these protests/riots is merely a spark, that the current protests/riots are actually entirely about something else and this is merely a single issue hijacked to simply to get people riled up.

That being said, ""*China's the one clearly in the wrong for this case*"" as you said which started this discussion? It just isn't true. Because if you look at the protests against the proposed law and the proposed law itself in isolation, ***the vehemenity of the protests just does not make sense***, and the protesters are entirely in the *WRONG*.

It's only when you consider the wider context of what the protesters are after that you can get an idea behind their methods of madness.

And even then it seems to be backfiring: Because of these protests/riots and the backlash of western powers (*include a smug UK trying to butt their noses back into Hong Kong*), these mess of a protest/riot has in effect ***SHORTENED*** the time HK has to prove itself capable of self-rule, since China has all but outright said that it is cancelling the ""Sino-British Joint Declaration"" (*that China has stuck with this agreement until recently is undeniable, and that was 'interesting' given how said agreement was forced sorta-kinda 'lawfully' onto China in the first place, just like Hong Kong was sorta-kinda 'rented out' to UK in the past too*).. I would say the system of Mandarins in Imperial China is a much better alternative.

To elaborate, I'm not so much of a fan of the imperial ruler himself, but simply of the mandarins (highly educated beurocrats) given the space to operate underneath. 

This is very relevant today, because every policy issue is highly detailed and technical. Maybe 0.1% of the general population understand fiscal policy properly, or can properly explain the pros and cons of quantitative easing. Or can understand a complicated foreign policy maneuver like Obama's pivot to Asia or the Iran Nuclear deal (I can't, and Trump certainly doesn't understand this at all, for example). 

If the people cannot understand the policy details, what good is asking me or my fellow poeple our opinion in running a country? 

This is akin to a doctor asking me if I want cotrimoxazole, ceftizidine or polymyxin B when I'm having a heavy fever. I have no understanding of microbiology, drug absorption, drug-drug interactions, antimicrobial therapy, side effects of these drugs etc. Then what's the point in asking me? I will most likely make a moronic choice, like ""ah give me the least bitter one can?""

Same with policy. I believe civil servants, who are highly trained on these specific issues, should be given the mandate to make decisions on our behalf, much like doctors are given a mandate to treat us on our behalf. We can have checks and balances in place, much like the medical profession has excellent checks and balances to prevent and punish medical malpractice. 

And this is not to mean the needs of the population are completely ignored. Much like a doctor carefully assesses the patient symptoms during a consultation, you can have focus groups, stratified interviews, an array of population markers like unemployment, inequality index, home ownership etc  to help guide decision making by understanding the needs and problems at the population level. But you should not ask the people what the bureaucrats should do, much like a doctor doesn't ask a patient exactly what tablet he needs.. Are you implying the HKers got something different to what they were promised? In what way? 

The 1997 transfer of sovereignty to China had no formal agreement from both sides on ""democratic elections"" in case you're harbouring that delusion.. Public policy is more nuanced than just going down-town and burning shit.

Who would have thought eh?. Recent history is a very good reference point.

Greece is a recent case of democracy gone wrong. Combination of populist politics, voter apathy, corruption and indiscretion in monetary policies.

The Philippines, a strongman seems to be able to get things on track or they somehow vote in celebrity. At the parliamentary level, pork barrel politics continue to dominate. I would not be surprised if Manual Pacqiao actually runs and gets elected for the presidency.

Thailand has basically went into the kind of chaos that is very much caused by opposing camps accusing the other of rigging the process. The country is being run by a junta... again. With the weak position of the King at the moment, the country will have much to go through.

Most of south asia despite having functional democracies, feature dysfunctional or central governments that are not trusted or unable to have an effective hold on it's territories.. On the other hand, the moment ""survived"" for almost 5 months now, it is because of leaderless. The government cannot just go ahead arrest the leader(s) and shut down the movement, which is what they did in 2014.. The colonies were not part of the UK. Legally and politically they were separate entities. The British voter, for instance could not actually vote for legislation that was domestic to say India. For example, India ware ruled by a government corporation, the East India company until 1858 and then directly by the British crown. Actually, If you want to apply the principle I stated that liberal democracy prevents civil unrest and violence over policy changes, the analysis works even here. The British empire was constantly running around putting down civil unrest and rebellions. The lack of any sort of representation also facilitated all sorts of awful and destructive policy in India and Ireland and so on.  Meanwhile, domestically, the UK last had a civil war in 1642 and last had a famine in the middle ages.  


"" if the government tomorrow declared that 90% of Singaporeans became  ineligible to vote (say based on income), but Parliament and the Courts  were preserved, you'd still say we're democratic? ""   


I would look at things in terms of a spectrum. I would say that we would become less democratic and this makes the problems of autocracy more likely. That being said, assuming the courts are independent in this scenario and parliament was not limpeh's parliament, this is still a heck of a lot better than China was in the 19th and 20th century and probably better than China today.. Sigh, even if the economic factor were so important, then why isn't it a part of the 5 demands? Why are there no slogans and propaganda about the housing crisis or income inequality. You think HKers would be more open about things that make them unhappy....... To be honest, I think the primary concern with any form of governance is ensuring that the government is acting out of the interests of the people.

Even the most inefficient of governments do a better job as long as they are genuinely acting out of the interest of the people (though there are plenty of blunders also showing good intentions can result in stupid outcomes. Great leap forward and Gorbachev for example). However, this feels largely tangential and unrelated to what system you're running (there are plenty of messed up democracies, and a few good examples of benevolent authoritarianism).

The argument people make for democracy however, is that if ensuring a benevolent government is the no.1 priority, then the assumption (tho largely not supported by anything) is that a democracy will be more likely to end up benevolent instead of an authoritarian government. The common line of reasoning is that they have an incentive to ""answer to the people"" because the people hold the power to remove them from office. (Which is of course... not very practically true in most democracies worldwide)

It's more difficult to impose checks and balances on a select group of bureaucrats however, and if their policies are too technical to understand, how can the people know if the policy is acting in their favour? Are they to blindly put their trust into their technocrat superiors? The less number of people in control, the easier it is to collude and the more incentives they have to go rogue. At least that's the argument made for democracy, though as I mentioned above it's hardly the case in real world scenarios... as they end up colluding anyway even with the people technically holding the vote.. The transfer was merely that, a transfer. The text of the Basic Law of Hong Kong however, states this: ""The socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years. "" and ""Chief Executive and members of the legislature is to be ultimately selected by universal suffrage upon nomination by a nomination committee."" Given that Hong Kong existed under a semi-democratic system, there is legal support for the continuation of democratic policies under these statements, despite possible narrower readings of them.. Bruh. Enough. You burned him alive already. Stop kicking his ashes around.. But there are far, far more cases of terrible autocratic states. Yemen, Somalia, sudan, north korea. Just go look at the democracy index, the trend is clear that quality of life and human rights are much better that autocratic regimes.. > The colonies were not part of the UK. Legally and politically they were separate entities. The British voter, for instance could not actually vote for legislation that was domestic to say India.

What? No, the British electorate elected their MPs, who formed their government, which appointed the Governor-General of India (and other colonial governors, including for Singapore). *Technically* the Crown appointed him, but like today, the Crown acted on the advice (read: instructions) of the government, because Parliament is sovereign. 

>Actually, If you want to apply the principle I stated that liberal democracy prevents civil unrest and violence over policy changes, the analysis works even here. The British empire was constantly running around putting down civil unrest and rebellions. The lack of any sort of representation also facilitated all sorts of awful and destructive policy in India and Ireland and so on. Meanwhile, domestically, the UK last had a civil war in 1642 and last had a famine in the middle ages.

Jacobite rising of 1745 would like to have a word with you. Long after England and Scotland had parliaments. Otherwise, agreed. 

>I would look at things in terms of a spectrum. I would say that we would become less democratic and this makes the problems of autocracy more likely. 

Fair enough. 

>That being said, assuming the courts are independent in this scenario and parliament was not limpeh's parliament, this is still a heck of a lot better than China was in the 19th and 20th century and probably better than China today.

China today uses a hierarchical electoral system. I'd argue that the average Chinese citizen today is politically represented far better than women and non-whites in 18th century America.. >""Chief Executive and members of the legislature is to be ultimately selected by universal suffrage upon nomination by a nomination committee.

You and I both know why this is a joke. Britain ruled Hong Kong for 150 years. During this entire history, they did NOT have universal suffrage. Even in the 1980s, only some legislators were ""elected"" by voting amongst some eligible members of the population. Even worse that how it is done today.

When the British left, they decided to unilaterally add in this joke of a clause. A textbook example of ""do as I say, not as a I do"". And you really expect China to say ok?

As for capitalism and the HK way of life, please point to me where any of that has not been accurately implemented.. U think ppl will read meh? They just believe what media says and follow blindly. Totalitarian regimes will tend to conduct such actions as it keeps them in power. Sudan, Somalia and even Yemen are practically in civil war status. The Pyongyang regime, is propped up by the nations that require it as a buffer.

I am not saying democracy is horrible as a system. I am saying that it is severely flawed and has so many weaknesses that keep appearing in recent times. I do not agree with recent statements that one party rule fits SG best. Well it will be if the other parties continue to game the system to their advantage, have all the ""power"" but almost none of the responsibility/accountability.

it is clear that HK's current problems are practically fascist in nature. Speak putonghua in HK? Be ready to hear ""return to mainland"" screamed at you. It is so fascist that if you are caucasian, you can berate the protesters and the worst they will do to you at that moment is scream ""shame on you"". Australian reporter escorts the actor to a police station and he gets death threats online.... There is no freedom in this at all. Democracy, universal suffrage, open elections are not something that is considered as The Sacred Cow of political systems. As a system of governance, it has plenty of problems. At the center of it, the people who are the center of it has to be able to not crave the temptation of remaining in power at any cost.. "" the Crown acted on the advice (read: instructions) of the government, because Parliament is sovereign ""

Ok, agreed. And this would have been after 1858. I think the key point is that UK voters had a representation while those in the colonies did not and the results speak for themselves.

Better represented? Maybe. However, lets not forget the big picture. China does not have an independent court system. It does not have independent political parties. For example, A woman or non white person in 19th century America could sue the government and win on the legal merits of the case. Here is a personal anecdote. While half my family fled China's self destruction to come here, a sizable chunk of them of them found their way to the US where they became successful business owners. There, they were one of the funders of the Wong Kim Ark lawsuit where a Chinese-American who basically sued the US government into obeying the 14th Amendment. Racism was a keystone of US public policy in 1898. Still, you could go do that. I don't think you could sue the CCP in a chinese court over a key public policy idea like this and win.  The Chinese constitution technically requires free speech. Can a chinese citizen sue their government in to allowing Xinnie the pooh memes and uncensored public Tianamen discussion? Can a Uighur sue his way out of the camps?. The changes that China are putting into force threaten to implement policies instituted by the Chinese government and prevent potential political activism.

And my point merely argues that your point was shaky, that there is legal standing for democracy in HK, and you merely reply by spewing rhetoric about British hypocrisy with the depth of a person who misread a postcolonial novel once.

Let's read the argument carefully:

You: There is no agreement for democracy by the two powers
Me: Statements in the Basic Law of HK can be interpreted as supporting democratic policies in HK.
You: Britain didn't have democracy while they were there as an evil colonialist power.
You: You expect China to follow a hypocritical deal?
You: The law has been implemented.

Which of your three points in your post actually deal with the actual substance of the argument, that there is a valid reading of the HK Basic Law, which was drafted by the two powers that argues that democracy should be taking place in HK?

In fact, your last two points tactitly acknowledge that there is a deal for democracy, otherwise China reneging on the deal would be irrelevant.

While we all know colonialism was a imperialist hegemony that subjugated the native peoples, the democracy given to them by the Brits gives something - the ability to choose their fate as a people.

The reason for the Brits giving them choice is irrelevant in the now. Not to ignore the history, the concerns of the people are in the now - that they have been given the expectation of democracy, and have been since 1997, a good twenty years.

But no, I guess you have to be right, the Brits were evil and HK is dumb and China totally isn't meddling in HK affairs to a point where they are seen as violating the Basic Law because actions seen as widespread violations of it are fine so long as it's the one in power who interprets the law who misuses it.. I don't disagree with what you said, but the reason why the protestors now want universal suffrage is because their government isn't working for them and their lives are shitty for the most part. 

If the average Hongkonger had the same social mobility and job prospects as the average Singaporean, the protests wouldn't be occurring, and Hongkongers would be happy with their flawed political system the same way Singaporeans are happy to keep the PAP in power. I keep reading comments from other Singaporeans about how the protestors keep destroying public property and ruining their own economy and livelihoods. It's not their economy and livelihood that they're destroying anyway.. Are you a troll? have you actual been to HK before? i've lived here for 3 years, and spoke putonghua with locals all the times, no one has screamed at me go ""return to mainland""  (It is so fascist that if you are caucasian, you can berate the protesters and the worst they will do to you at that moment is scream ""shame on you"" ) - what is this statement even about? you berate protestor and they scream back at you, thats just freedom of speech, something evidently lacking in china. 

  Democracy, universal suffrage, open elections are not something that is considered as The Sacred Cow of political systems.  Then what are the sacred cow of political systems? Have a almighty state that can make people disappear at will? Ban all dissent and protests and silence everyone?

Democracy is not severely flawed, its the best governance system compared to all other governance systems, because the people are actually involved with the governance. It's much better than hoping for benevolent dictators.. Good points.. ... so, lemme ask a thought experiment. 

If the courts of an utter balls-out dictatorship has enough autonomy and power to curtail and control said dictatorship in favor of justice... would it be just as good a country as a democratic country with a similarly strong court system?

We‚Äôre talking lower courts all the way up to Supreme Court here. Not those that make the actual laws... or are they one and the same?

Can they be decoupled too?

Just making sure that it‚Äôs still democracy we‚Äôre talking about here.. If you read my comment again

>The 1997 transfer of sovereignty to China had no formal *agreement from both sides* on ""democratic elections"" 

Key phrase being an agreement from both sides. The British are cheeky fucks, who unilaterally inserted a comment about universal suffrage at the last moment, when a) the rest of the legal document was written in careful consultation with China, and b) when they did not care to have universal suffrage in their entire 150 years of colonial rule. 

If the British had inserted a clause unilaterally declaring Santa Claus as the patron saint of Hong Kong, would China be obliged to respect that as well?. I fully agree with you that these people are demonstrating because they are miserable (high unemployment, particularly among youth, low youth home ownership, and a dismal outlook in the future). This is the core problem. 

My question is, how does democracy solve this? How does democracy automatically bring about economic development? We are sold a false idea by the west, that democracy is synonymous with prosperity. This is patently false. Look at third world democracies like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, many African countries, stuck with poor growth and uncoordinated development. Democracy was no panacea to them. Look at countries like SG, Taiwan, South Korea even China, which went through remarkable economic growth during periods of authoritarian or less-than-ideal democratic conditions. Look to HK during their 150 years of prosperity under British non-domocratic rule. 

Economic malaise is the problem in HK. Democracy is not the solution though.. Good for you, I would say. Many residents have not quite had the luxury of being able to disagree with the protesters. Maybe you should try cleaning the ""democracy walls"". Or you agree with them so you will never think to do it.

Screaming at you is tame, beating you or helping your shop do renovation is another. A taxi driver having to shout ""5 demands, not one less"" repeatedly when going through the legal and just road blocks is also freedom. Live near police quarters? Get ready for your phones, wallets, social media, chat grps to be verified when trying to go home when there is a freedom roadblock near your home. None of the protesters are trying to silence, instill fear and nearly murder their critics.

I wasn't quite trolling you before, now I am doing it..... I think each element of a democracy serves a unique function in ensuring sustainable governance. Note that I say 'sustainable  governance' as opposed to 'good governance'. There are occasionally good despots and often bad democracies. The key thing is that by avoiding  catastrophic outcomes that destroy everything ,  democracies can leverage long periods of sustained compounding growth. Exponential growth is an incredibly powerful force over time even if the annual  rate of increase is small. This is why it is so important to avoid Chinese style inter-dynastic implosions. 

But I  digress. I think free and fair elections are important because they defuse any conflicts about whether the government has a mandate and is legitimate.  You can try to cherry pick the various  features of a democracy and the end result may be better  than full blown ccp style authoritarian rule,  but you are still likely going  to run into social unrest and other avoidable problems. HK under the British was a good illustration of the problems this can cause.  British, unsurprisingly,  never allowed universal suffrage in HK even though  the court system and civil service was independent. As a result, British rule of HK was regularly beset by huge acts of civil unrest,  such as in 1967 and so on that stemmed from questions about the legitimacy of British rule. This is even  though in hindsight British HK was doing well and was a reasonably popular arrangement. Had the British allowed free and fair elections,  those that sought decolonisation would have had clear feedback about how much legitimacy the British had, and would have a peaceful outlet by which to present their argument to the people of HK. 

Note that even though the PAP likes to fuck with the independence of all of our civic institutions,  they don't dare touch universal suffrage and don't  dare to harm the integrity of our vote such as by engaging in ballot stuffing etc...  This is smart. To do otherwise is to invite  catastrophic consequences. 

IMO, the CCP would have been wise to allow universal suffrage. It would have prevented this whole disaster. Them making the argument that 'but the British did not allow elections so we ate entitled to do the same',  shows that they simply aren't learning from history. Just because you are entitled to do something does not mean it is correct.. The Basic Law was drafted by 23 HK members and 36 mainland PRC members, with Louis Chia (HK), ethnically Chinese introducing the mainstream model that was adopted by the HK Basic Law Drafting Committee. No Brits were directly involved in the drafting of Basic Law. 

The British did not slip any clauses in, though you may argue that their moves towards democratisation in HK in the late 80s and 90s were aimed at reducing the grasp of China on their former colony.

If Hong Kong and China write a legal document together declaring that Santa Claus was the patron Saint of  Hong Kong, even if it were something that Britain pushed for in the final days of their ownership of HK, then yes, China would be obliged to respect it.. Yeah, you raise a very good point, that democracy is not synonymous with prosperity. I also agree that the protestors' demands aren't entirely realistic and are also entirely short-term.

The thing is, though, the HK pro-Beijing government has had 22 years to fix this. They've spent the past five months dithering about the protests, as well, other than to escalate violence which of course only begets more violence.

So, if the government is not going to change on its own, how is it going to change?

I did come across an SCMP article from a few months ago about how Beijing was ramming through legislation to improve housing availability via the HK Legislative Council, though, so maybe that change can come from the CCP. Of course, the protests have created new grievances, and those will need to be settled as well..  None of the protesters are trying to silence, instill fear and nearly murder their critics.  I agree, its the CCP doing that.. Hmmm... something to think about, even if I don‚Äôt fully agree. Thanks for your thoughts on this.. Please lar some of the more radical rioters are doing it. You disagree with them and you are not white, GLHF. Ah yes, the radical rioters makes the whole 5 month protests invalid, why didn't i think of that before......",27422.0,17,455,1

It's so interesting to see how the way we speak has changed so much.. Oct 1985, the Centerpoint Kids made up of English speaking Chinese, Eurasians and Indians from mission schools attacked a young Malay chap Called Asmawi, packer from KC Dat and kicked him to death. The Police rounded up 9 of them and charged them. Since that murder, the Centrepoint kids disassembled for good..

Also, it used to be that if we are going to Orchard people would put in the effort to dress up but now most people choose comfort over fashion. Haha!. Haha! I always think it's easier to put the blame on particular groups but it is more like an individual thing, it's just 'easier' to not put in the effort to practice and speak good English. Also, it kinda became a culture if you try to speak like how they were speaking in the video most people would just be like ""are you trying to show off that you speak good English"" or like ""that person is so fake, speaking with an accent and all.""",465.0,5,1,1

I've been trying to find those of less well-known models such as the inkbook Explore and the Pocketbook Inkpad 3 but no luck so far :/ I feel that it's also quite difficult to find such things in sg as ereaders generally aren't popular here.

I recommend getting a Kobo ereader as it has Overdrive, which allows you to check out ebooks from NLB (will need to do some Kobo Account gymnastic to get access to overdrive)

As for where to buy, carousell has some seller AFAIK, but I bought one direct from Kobo website.. Kindle is good only if you need a small screen. 

No pen support + tiny screen 

There is a dealer for Boox on carousell.  Been using this brand for a while.. I got mine from AliExpress.

If you Google ebook reader Singapore, there's a local importer that brings in Kobos & the boox series iirc. You can find some brand-new Kobo and Onyx e-readers on Carousell. My friend got a Kobo from abroad which works fine here. I currently use Kindle Voyage which I love but may resort to other brands in the future if Amazon doesn‚Äôt release a Voyage 2. For alternative e-readers, I‚Äôd rather buy them direct online or ship them via Comgateway. But bear in mind the warranty will most likely be void.

Was looking at Monte Cristo 4 by Onyx not long ago. Onyx looks like a Russian co but is actually Chinese. The one brand that is really elusive for me is Tolino, which is only available in Europe.. Yeah, but Kindle is kinda limited because of that proprietary .azw format. No support for epub which has a bigger library (not to mention e-library support) as well as PDFs and .cbr/cbz if you read a lot of manga and comics.

1st quarter: Singapore defend really well and keep Bermuda to a low score

2nd quarter: Bermuda make a comeback and score a lot

3rd quarter: SG start really badly with all of our important players making mistakes

4th quarter: SG steady the ship and clinch the win just before the match ends

Hope that helps!

Genuinely thought that we had lost after the entire top order got dismissed cheaply. Glad that Navin Param's innings got us over the line. I hope the boys rest well before the big game against the Dutch on Tuesday. Majulah!

[Here's the full scorecard of the match]( Don't know anything about cricket or that Singapore even had a team, but I'm happy to see we're performing in at least one sport internationally.   


*Looks over at Lions.*. V Baskaran, 4 overs for 8 runs (two out of those 4 overs were maidens) and a wicket in a T20. Truly a madlad.. As an Indian PR who lives here and who LOVES cricket, at times I do not get the chance to express my love for the game to the Chinese, Malays and other nationalities/races who do not know much about cricket. 

For now, the Singapore Cricket Team consists only of Indians, Sri Lankans, Australians and Pakistanis (correct me if I've missed any nationality).

Hopefully performances as such can inspire people of other races to take up the sport and make the country proud.

Can't wait to see games like India vs Singapore or Australia vs Singapore (if our boys can make it to the top 10).

JIAYOUUUU SINGAPORE üá∏üá¨üëçüëç. How to read cricket scores? I have no idea what these numbers mean?. That was one great match. Singapore is rising like the Afgans. (for those of us who don't follow cricket) Realistically, is Singapore likely to qualify?. 

This is the match highlights for those interested. Hope they show it on fox sports Live on starhub. I did not know we are that good at cricket.. ~~The Only Other Team Sports That Singaporeans Excel IN~~. And to add on: 

Our local homegrown boys really stood up to be counted today. Janak Prakash, who had the most wickets and scored the decisive boundary to win the game (akin to a goal in the 90th min) is 19 years old and still in or just finished NS.. thx for the short summary. Have no interest in sports whatsoever.

But the way you broke it down, it must have been a really tense 4th quarter.. *pokes them with stick*

Come on, qualify for something. >we're performing in at least one sport internationally.

Joseph Schooling not counted meh?. Indoor skydiving.. Wow thanks for pointing that out. two maidens made all the difference today. The first number is runs, the second is wickets. 

The batsman hits the ball and then runs up and down. Going from one side to the other is one run. The wickets is the number of batsmen that are 'out'. There are 3 sticks behind the batsman called wickets. If the bowlers ball hits the wicket, the batsman is out. If the batman is running and the opposing team is able to retrieve the ball to hit the wickets, the batsman is out. The batsman can also hit the ball to the boundary. If the ball reaches the boundary, it's 4 runs. If the ball reaches the boundary without touching the ground, it's 6 runs. 

Each team has 11 batsmen - but 2 play at the same time so 10 chances. But in this version of the game there is a limit to the number of balls bowled. 20 overs each with 6 balls so 120 balls. And at the end of this limit, the team with the higher number of runs wins. But it is also possible to bowl out a team (eliminate all batsmen) before they reach the ball limit. 

TLDR: cricket is like baseball, but with 2 batsmen on a lane instead of a quadrant. And there is only one chance for an out. 

Also my knowledge is rusty and I'm using simple terms instead of proper cricket terms so please correct me if I'm wrong. This is also a simplified version, there is a bit more complexity to the game.. Okay so cricket teams take turns to score runs (points). 

Each team has 20 overs (over = 1 set of 6 throws), which is basically the time they are allocated to score as many points as they can. Each team also has 10 outs only. More runs + fewer outs = good.  


Bermuda won the coin toss before the match and decided to bat (score points) first.  
In their time allocated (20 overs), Bermuda scored 149 runs and had 7 batters out, hence 149/7. 

  
When it was Singapore's turn to bat, they needed to score 150 runs in order to beat Bermuda's score (and hence win the match). 

Singapore scored 152 runs and had 5 batters out hence 152/5. They managed to achieve this midway through the 20th set, hence you can see the notation ""19.3/20"" right next to the SG flag.  


Extra info: RR/CRR stands for ""run rate"" and ""current run rate"" respectively. Basically it's the average number of runs scored every over (or points per set if you will). It helps fans keep track of how well the teams are doing. In a tournament like this, run rates below 7 are bad, and run rates above 8.5 are really good. 7-8.5 is about the normal range.. I wish everything you are saying comes true.. Singapore is supposed to be an underdog in the group.  Still there are more matches to play. who knows it might happen.. You probably won‚Äôt get a definite answer because no one wants to jinx it haha. That is some disappointing highlights. Not even showing the scores. 

Was this match live streamed somewhere?. Oh yes it absolutely was! One of our players (Navin Param) really turned things around for us by playing an excellent game! We were all intensely refreshing our scorecards for updates (the match wasn't broadcast). AFF Suzuki Cup can annot. >Joseph Schooling

[Huge reality check for Joseph Schooling after world championship flop]( His bowling in general should have made all the difference.. T20 is still very rewarding as a slugfest. If we do qualify, we need to find ways to up our run getting or we will not perform too well. I do not hold out for too much but a few good showings would be really good. Bangladesh started out not too well in international T20 and ODIs either but has progressed quite well.. Although you are correct, PNG and the Netherlands are the other two tough teams Singapore has to face.. Nah , only the games happening at the two big stadiums are being streamed unfortunately.

Two cartons of milk? Sure. A trolley with enough food stockpile to last a nuclear winter? No.. Just say ""oh I'm with her, we are paying together."". I think if it is only one or two item, it is still understandable but if that person returns with a trolley full of items, that is too much. ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do"".

What we are doing in this Q thing is nothing compared to them.  


So our social thingy is somewhere in the middle. Nothing wrong, Nothing right. Just the way we do things.. Imagine you're in a foreign land and tell the locals what's right and wrong. Seems pretty arrogant. Also, it's not like you're bringing a whole trolley over. Just 2 small items.. You did nothing wrong.. Perfectly normal.

He probably did not live here enough to know how things are.. Reading all these comments, now I know why we are called a first world country with third world people.. By right, queue when you ready.
But some of us just wan to test the limit of other person.
Imagine everybody is doing this in the whole line.. perhaps they are thinking of this - 

having someone queue first and just cutting in because you happen to know someone there, are two different things.. people just salty. As long as you are asking your family member/friend and not someone you don't know to help you pay, AND have it in one transaction/one receipt, that is not queue cutting and I don't see any problem with that. This is largely acceptable here in Singapore.. I find it perfectly acceptable if your sister was queuing with some items already, and you're just adding on two bottles of milk. I find it less acceptable if your sister was queuing empty-handed just to ""chope"" a queue spot for you.. His wrong, your not wrong.. I get angry when people forgot to weigh their veggies & then the cashier has to do for them.

Normally anything that has no price like veggies especially at Giants supermarket,i always ask the worker who do the weighing 'does this need to be weigh?'.

It simply irritating. Dude white dudes don't dictate our culture. They fit into ours. Not the other way around. Nothing wrong. In Rome do as the Romans. Angmor has no right to intervene in local culture.

No offending the master race.. White man all very opinionated no matter if they are right or wrong. They have a need to voice out.

Unfortunately this is Singapore, so you can tell white man to adapt or die. Of course bring a trolley load you'll get alot of tsk tsk from aunties/uncles too. So 2-3 items is fine.

Don't worry my wife like to do this to me all the time. Leave me in queue while she go grab stuff she forgot. Normal and acceptable to us, so don't worry. White guy don't understand our culture. i would have said more to him just cause he is an ang moh. You are technically still in the queue, he was just trying to be an opportunist. I agree it‚Äôs ok if you only have one or two items.. unless your 2 bottles of milk put you over the under X items cashier point, nah.. So the trick is to pass the milk to your sis and head off ;). most likely its fine if its just a few more items but not with a trolley full of items. one or two items is fine, but bring a big trolley or baskets full  - :|. Yea its fine for two bottles of milk. If you have like an entire trolley then not cool for sure.

Ignore that dude.. If you are paying together, its ok. If you are paying separately, then join the queue.. This is totally fine, anywhere. He must've thought you saw a friend and tried to cut the queue.

Were you just holding on to the milk or did you drop it into your sister's trolley/basket?. If replace white man with bangla would you still doubt yourself?. What may be acceptable here some, may not be for others. I generally frown upon such behavior since if not fair for the other customers who are behind the line.. Wow.... So this is basically a hate white guy thread? 
""Adopt our culture"" ""ang moh should just mind own business"" 
For a multi cultural country where a singaporean kan be chinese, malay, philippino, indian, white. Thid is very interesting. And really racist..... So what I‚Äôm getting from your post and other replies is that he thought you were cutting queue and didn‚Äôt know you were joining your sister. After u told him then he apologized, albeit sarcastically. 

If that is the case then it wasn‚Äôt wrong for him to call you out for queue cutting since he didn‚Äôt know u two were together. In fact, I feel we should be calling out bad behavior more than simply doing nothing about it then sulk online on social media, which u often see being posted here. Don‚Äôt get too offended by him calling you out. It‚Äôs not a cultural difference, it‚Äôs simple just how things played out.. Well just pass the milk to your sister then?. It's not wrong. You are not extending the queue because you are occupying the intended slot. The white man must learn our ways or die.. Wow.... So this is basically a hate white guy thread? 
""Adopt our culture"" ""ang moh should just mind own business"" 
For a multi cultural country where a singaporean kan be chinese, malay, philippino, indian, white. Thid is very interesting. And really racist..... amdk always right, remember your place sinkie. Just stare at him and pretend not to speak English. Singapore is part of China after all.. This brings back horrible memories. ""Ah boy, you queue first, mama go take some eggs.""

Proceed to hyperventilate when it's my turn next and she's not back. Did she die? Did someone kidnap her on the way to the eggs??. THIS!!!!!. This happened with my husband and I at Mustafa! And it was 2 full trolleys of things. Entitled bastards.. What if it's just one person whose immediately before you with a basket or trolley, leaving the queue to pick up a carton of milk or a loaf of bread (1 or 2 items), expecting you to hold their position for them, and they just come back and conveniently slot in front of you again?

Too many times have I encountered this situation. WIBTA for ignoring their unilateral implicit *social contract*?

Edit: forgot to mention that they leave their basket or trolley at the spot.. Yeah the guy probably didn‚Äôt know. Just ask politely. I don‚Äôt understand why people always assume the worst in others.. Brb, engaging in gladiatorial combat with the aunty pushing a trolley-full of Campbell's Soup.. Yea I just said, she‚Äôs here what. And he apologised sarcastically. It‚Äôs just annoying cause I know it‚Äôs how we are culturally, not ideal in the eyes of the western but fuck their approval. you wait until some bodoh husband shows up with a fully loaded trolley after you've been in queue for 15+ mins see your blood boil or not hahaha. a few items ok la, +10 is a definite no-no.. Happens quite often in Singapore unfortunately.. That sounded like a sweeping statement, but at the same time that's largely the case and no one can say you are wrong in making that comment.. What is ‚Äútheir kind?‚Äù White people? That‚Äôs a huge mix of different cultures/races. Even by stereotyping, I honestly can‚Äôt think of every one of them being the example you mentioned.. Hahah I had that conversation with my sisters. But which comments in specific?. Some cashier especially like to say to customers 'buy 2 lah..got promo..then customers have to go take another bottle/packet that located at the far end'.

Sometimes it cashier fault..forcing customers to buy because there is promotion.

Imagine the only counter to be open.

That why nowadays,i prefer checking out through self checkout at NTUC.Giants should have cash payment for self checkout.

Giants is still way behind in term of serving customers.

NTUC,Prime Supermarket,Ustars are all in front.. Yes, it happens a lot at 4D queues. I once told that person in queue, you're giving away your luck to someone else. He thought about it for awhile, call back that acquaintance and ask her to queue for herself.. I haven't really met any sinkie who dares to do that, at most only bully other sinkies.. I feel so ashamed to be Singaporean when I read comments like this.. May not be acceptable for others but that doesn‚Äôt give one the entitlement to speak in a condescending tone.

Do I agree with the practice of using tissue paper to chope seats? No. Do I practise that? No. But do I go round telling people off for doing that? No, because I understand it‚Äôs culturally acceptable here.. If I had really cut queue then I would be fine with it cause I do call people out for cutting queues. But I remember him interrupting my conversation with my sister, cause I was like sorry? What did you say? Then he repeated himself. So he knew my sister was already in line. Why are you so sensitive?  Haven't you seen other posts about mainland Chinese needing to adjust local norms?  How is a it racist?. Always happened when I was a child holding a basket of NTUC items but no money. Nope. I ignore it too. You leave the queue, you lose the spot. That's what I think anyway. It's common and perfectly acceptable in western culture too. Sounds like he was just an asshole. In supermarts in France, sometimes people forget to print the tags for vegetables at the weighing machine and they do exactly this too, so seriously fuck him. Idk wife and I did this all the time in the US and no one ever made a fuss. Not sure why you had to bring up ‚Äúwestern culture‚Äù. It‚Äôs nothing to do with race/culture. If the guy really didn‚Äôt let you go even after you told him, he‚Äôs an asshole. Not everything is racial thing. In fact, when I was in Europe and was shopping alone, occasional I would forget things and the strangers behind me would hold my spot while I get the stuff. I‚Äôm sure Singaporeans will also do this when asked nicely. There are nice people and assholes in every culture, race and country.. I imagine the guy had a couple aunties squeeze by him in the past, and let that colour his view of things. I also imagine he hasn't been to many parts of the world, because he'd know that Singaporeans are excellent queuers on the scale of it.. > And he apologised sarcastically. 

\*Cue South Park's 'Sorry' meme. They also don‚Äôt need our approval in bastardizing Asian dishes like tea, Chicken rice that looks more of a salad with honey sauce and the classic crispy rendang. Happens in Soviet culture as well. Some put their shoes in the queue and sit down, or just tell someone physically queuing that they are after them, then go elsewhere.. It's totally normal in the west... The only thing I'd say that's expected is not to hold the queue up. Like if your turn comes, let them through first. 

Maybe just having a bad day, wouldn't dwell on it.. Happens in most Asian countries really.  The poorer the country, the more the ""Expats"" like to think that the locals are wrong.. kind refers to only those that tries to force their way of doing things wherever they go. Well they all have one thing in common. They used to have massive empires and they LOVE meddling in other countries affairs. Those that are particularly racist. Someone mentioned that this guy probably does not travel enough to know about other cultures. That‚Äôs hilariously hypocritical because this is practice of ‚Äúsaving spots‚Äù is also seen in all first world countries. I honestly don‚Äôt know why you had to bring his race into it. The moment you did, all the racists start emerging. Reddit Singapore is mostly left winged but now I truly see how many have been hiding. Maybe not assume it‚Äôs always about race?. Nowadays I don't even queue for 4d or toto. Just buy online using the app. when a foreigner is rude to you in your own country, especially one that feels superior to you, i feel ashamed to have someone that won't stand up for oneself or a citizen. I served my NS to not feel ashame for standing up and saying something. Then maybe he was really just being an ass. Or maybe it wasn‚Äôt clear enough to him. Or maybe back in wherever he came from, some people fake the knowing someone to get into the queue (in Singapore we won‚Äôt talk to strangers for no reason, heck sometimes we see friends we also try to avoid. Ang moh country is more approachable. In that case maybe there is the cultural difference)

Whatever it is, I think like others say just let it pass lor. We know ourselves do this is okay can liao. You‚Äôre all good, no social cues breached.. Then prob thinking: ""oh shit my mom abandoned me with a bunch of ntuc items"", filled with anxiety... oh man bad times man. Tricky thing is when they leave their basket or trolley at the spot, gone and grabbed their stuff, and came back before the queue has moved.. Thats fair.. Yeah well there are people like that in every race an culture. Can‚Äôt avoid.. That‚Äôs the US and UK. There are many more white-dominated countries in the world.. Me too. That was from long before.. What has culture got to do with any of this? That guy probably just had a bad day or is an asshole. This practice is done in every first world country. the fact that you pulled race into this is astonishing. And the fact that you emphasised you‚Äôd scold him just because he his white is even more appalling. I would always stand up to Singaporeans, but only those who deserve it. I‚Äôm not a blind patriot. Supporting or offending someone just based on their colour of their skin is the definition of racism. If you‚Äôre asking me to be racist to be Singaporean, then I‚Äôll gladly get the hell out. But I believe the majority of us are nice and polite and you‚Äôre just a minority. Hopefully.. Ah then unusually just let it be. What's a few more minutes. But I usually encounter those that did this, the line needed to move so I did. Basket be damned. You think the French haven‚Äôt interfered in world events and made their own empires. Everyone in Western Europe and Russia is guilty of this.. You haven't had your share of racism abroad. You don't have to tell a minority in this country what is racism and what is not.
Just having a bad day is not an excuse. You're even defending the person. That's inexcusable.. You aren‚Äôt wrong. But white people aren‚Äôt the only ones guilty of this. So I don‚Äôt think it should be an exclusively white thing. Grouping all of them under this criteria is a little far fetched.. Wow I didn‚Äôt know you knew who I am and how many countries I‚Äôve been to and all the experiences I‚Äôve had there. I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an excuse. He‚Äôs an asshole if he knew they were together and still didn‚Äôt let her go. You assumed he did it because of race. There are billions of other reasons but you chose this one. That‚Äôs racism.. Bravo next ms universe champion of world peace. 

What I'm trying to say to you, racism whether you like it or not exist in everyone. There's a reason why stereotypes exist. It's an unconsious bias. You can call it casual racism, you can call it whatever you want. It exist. It will continue to exist.

81,Singapore Beats Bermuda in their second game at the Cricket World Cup qualifiers after beating Scotland on Friday!!,dkjnvq,2019-10-20 13:33:49,notexthere,35,0.8,16.0,"I really hope they win the cup so we can see which of our local politicians are thick-skinned enough to crawl out of the woodwork for photo opportunities..  (copied my comment from the other thread)

Brief story of the match without any cricket terminology:

1st quarter: Singapore defend really well and keep Bermuda to a low score

2nd quarter: Bermuda make a comeback and score a lot

3rd quarter: SG start really badly with all of our important players making mistakes

4th quarter: SG steady the ship and clinch the win just before the match ends

Hope that helps!

Genuinely thought that we had lost after the entire top order got dismissed cheaply. Glad that Navin Param's innings got us over the line. I hope the boys rest well before the big game against the Dutch on Tuesday. Majulah!

[Here's the full scorecard of the match]( Well played navin param!. See sinkies, who says ceca got no benefits. tbh, I don't feel very invested in cricket. The last time I watched cricket, it was mandatory attendance for school, and the most interesting thing was one of our players getting hit in the face by the ball. Cricket is a funny sport. Its basically Indian/Pakis playing against each other wearing different flags. Any country that manages to attract lots of Indian foreign workers will somehow end up with a decent cricket team.. These are qualifiers for the World Cup and even if we just qualify it would be a huge, HUGE achievement.. I think you feel like this because you live in Singapore. I think you may want to research a bit more about cricket and which countries play the sport.... Australia, South Africa?. prepare to be downvoted lol. not true. The philippines team is also comprised of Indians.. New Zealand, West Indies. I agree, it's predominant in countries where cricket is not as popular and there also happens to be quite a few Indians like Canada, US etc. But countries such as England, and Australia predominantly consist of their own race of people playing.. yes of course. i am not stupid. my statement obviously does not apply to traditional cricket playing nations like England .... Yep, non traditional countries like Nigeria, Jersey, Papua New Guinea, Bermuda and Namibia are filled with Indians, no natives in those teams at all...oh wait, hold up, that's not true in the slightest..

> SINGAPORE: Singapore and China on Sunday (Oct 20) signed an updated defence agreement to scale up bilateral military exercises, provide mutual logistics support and establish regular dialogues between their defence ministers.

> The enhanced Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation (ADESC) formalises activities between Singapore‚Äôs Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA), including port calls, bilateral exercises, mutual visits and cross-attendance of courses, MINDEF said in a news release on Sunday.

> The countries had agreed to sign the enhanced ADESC in May when Singapore‚Äôs Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen formally met his Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe at the MINDEF building ahead of the latter‚Äôs participation in the Shangri-La Dialogue.

> At the time, Dr Ng said the agreement was not meant to be a ‚Äúbellwether of anything‚Äù amid the climate of US-China tensions, adding that Singapore wants good relations with all countries and together with China ‚Äúhas shared perspectives for a stable and inclusive region, especially for security matters‚Äù.

> In Beijing on Sunday, Dr Ng signed the agreement with General Wei in a move that MINDEF said reaffirms the countries‚Äô ‚Äúwarm and close friendship‚Äù, reflecting ‚Äúsignificant progress‚Äù in their defence relationship over the past decade and their commitment to strengthen it.

> Dr Ng is in China from Oct 17 to 22 having called on Chinese President Xi Jinping and attended the Military World Games in Wuhan on Friday. He will also give a speech at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum on Tuesday.

> In addition to formalising ongoing defence activities between Singapore and China, the enhanced ADESC includes these new areas of cooperation:

> Commitment to regularise and scale up bilateral exercises and interactions across the Army, Navy and Air Force

> Setting up of a Visiting Forces Agreement for troops participating in bilateral exercises

> Setting up of a mutual logistics support arrangement with China

> Establishment of a regular Singapore-China ministerial-level dialogue and continued high-level cross-attendance at multilateral conferences and dialogues, such as Singapore‚Äôs Shangri-La Dialogue and the Beijing Xiangshan Forum

> Establishment of a bilateral hotline

> Conduct of exchanges among military academies and think-tanks

> ‚ÄúBeyond bilateral cooperation, Singapore and China also reaffirmed both countries‚Äô commitment to cooperating closely on multilateral platforms in the enhanced ADESC, including the ADMM (ASEAN Defence Ministers‚Äô Meeting)-Plus and the Experts‚Äô Working Group exercises, the ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise and Exercise Coordinated Response,‚Äù MINDEF said.

> The ADMM-Plus includes Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US.

> In a call earlier on Sunday, MINDEF said Dr Ng and General Wei discussed ‚Äúsubstantive proposals‚Äù to expand bilateral defence cooperation, including the scaling up and institutionalising of Exercise Cooperation and Exercise Maritime Cooperation, as well as a new Memorandum of Understanding on academic exchanges between SAFTI Military Institute and the PLA Academy of Military Sciences.

> 

> Exercise Cooperation is the countries‚Äô flagship army exercise which started in 2009. The fourth edition held in Singapore in July involved about 240 personnel from the Singapore Armed Forces‚Äô 3rd Singapore Division and 1st Commando Battalion, as well as PLA‚Äôs Southern Theater Command Army 74th Army Group.

> 

> The ADESC was first signed by then-Permanent Secretary for Defence Chiang Chie Foo and then-PLA Deputy Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Ma Xiaotian in 2008 to formalise ongoing defence cooperation between the two countries and provide a framework for developing a bilateral defence partnership.

Anyone facing the same problem or successfully re-admitted into jc?,4,0.55,29.0,"Doesn‚Äôt this mean you shld try ITE dude?. To be real honest, if u cannot tahan jc, cannot tahan poly, u should start thinking if there is other underlying reasons why you‚Äôre not adapting well to either environments. You will not always be able to tahan whatever environment or situation you‚Äôre thrown into. Not every time you can simply walk out and restart all over. NS is one if you‚Äôre a guy. And if u want to go jc, your a levels very is not enough you need to go to uni, and uni will be similar but much worse than poly. That you die die must tahan, at least poly got diploma when u graduate. Sit down and carefully think through what is the real reasons why you‚Äôre not coping well at either places. Work them out from there. Don‚Äôt just keep flip flop prata shop and in the end go nowhere, waste time and burn yourself on the grill.. You drop out jc because you cannot tahan jc. You now want to drop out of poly because you cannot tahan poly. Make up your fickle mind lmao. Don‚Äôt think anyone is facing the same problem

When you go back to JC, can you tahan?. Wow you taking trial package? Trial test JC and poly?. No.. Apply again w your o results. I think u should think a lot and consider before applying since you want to drop out of poly after dropping jc. Was the studying too tough, the environment or your mental health? Good luck for whatever decision you made. So many people giving you unnecessary advice and acting so grand on their high horses. No, you are not going to be stopped. They just care about your results. O level results. Apply again. 

They doubt you‚Äôll survive, but that‚Äôs a different story. What you do is up to you. But to enter? You are not stopped. But fair warning, don‚Äôt drop out of poly yet in case no one wants you because of other reasons.. []( Don't give up!! At some moments in life, it will feel overwhelming and you will feel like giving up. Put one foot in front of the other and show up each day. You will be glad that you saw it through. You are stronger than you realise. :). Why you dropped of of JC?
Why you cant tahan poly?????. Was from poly, dropped out, went to JC and finished my A Levels. Final year in uni now and it was one of the worst decisions i've made. So much wasted time and could have had exemptions from some uni modules.. your mind is accustomed to giving up right now as soon as it gets uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

Suggest you take things slow and do what you can where you are right now.

And no, it is super highly unlikely any JC would accept you back. Once you accept that fact you can move on to what needs to be done.. Whats the reasons?. Don't take the easy way out. You do it once, you will always be looking for that easy way out. Why short-change yourself? Time and tide wait for no man. Ditter too long and your time is gone. You are too old to study in JC or poly. You have to work to support yourself and family with a O levels. Then where can you go with O levels? Opportunity is out there, but here you need the cert to open that door. Without a diploma, you can't do much I'm afraid. 

If you re-admit to JC, you will be older than your classmates and at least 1 yr behind your cohort. Or likely they will have graduated already. That's at least 2 years wasted.. Bruh poly so much more slack than JC.. I have had friends who did so. They only care about your results.. If he drop out of ITE how?. Lol this comment is even funnier than the top 2.

The most cringe thing I saw from one NSF is a picture of him in No 3 uniform with the Singapore flag IN the hand of his female kpop idol.. Not kpop girls?. I think there are a lot of weebs in Singapore. NS is two years where you have very little control over who you hang out with (ie your current situation) so you basically just got a glimpse into what most teenage Singaporean males spend their time doing (besides dota).. People used to hang posters. Now they use wallpapers. Nothing has changed!. because anime is cool and good

You wouldn't ask this question from girls who ""stan"" their various k-pop groups and whatnot. Let guys be fangirls too.. Because influencers/anime girls wouldn‚Äôt kenna Potong jalan by other people. 2D waifus wont betray you. When I was in NS we had SNSD posters everywhere. Can someone tell me who the hottest Singaporean influencer is? I want to see what so good about them.. Prinz Eugen is best girl. Lots of triggered people here. What do you have as your background picture then?. Not just NSFs do this but I'm sure many Singaporean guys do this as well. People can like what they enjoy. I have Call of Duty wallpaper.... What if I am an NSFs with pictures of... The forest as my phone background. Will it remind me of outfield? Or worst will MP catch me due to in camp photo?. lol as opposed to what? I know 90% of international sch kids put pictures of themselves as the wallpaper.

Basically this shows the difference in values. Sinkies are slaves to influencer or anime waifu, but the centre of the amdk universe is themselves.

So many times I burst out laughing seeing kids with pictures of their own selfie as their wallpaper. Ludicrously selfabsorbed. Heng I put photo of Jesus as my wallpaper and Guanyin as the home screen.. Dunno, around my office most guys put their kids as their phone background. Personally I put my waifu (the 3D sort). We're old =X. WHY NO ONE ASK THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION? OP WHAT IS YOUR WALLPAPER? POST LEH!. fandom   
it's the same as utilising pictures of products/logos of known brands (like, Ferrari) as wallpapers. 2D girls cant be stolen. luckily I have rv's Irene as my wallpaper. When I was in secondary school, one of my schoolmates went around school trying to convince his girlfriend was Korean dancing queen, BoA.

&#x200B;

We laughed in his face.. That's the same as asking why someone likes a certain hobby you can't comprehend. It's inexplainable.. and is there something wrong with that? alot of people do that, not just NSFs. Who gave this gold?. Boys around NS age are typically still within the tail end of puberty. Some kinda put it off for a bit to focus on studies, but once that‚Äôs done and NS starts they end up with a LOT of time to kill.

So they spend time watching anime, reading through Instagram, whatever during their spare time in NS. Not surprising they change pictures soon after.

That said it‚Äôs not universal. For reference, my background picture is of a flaming skeleton police officer (Inferno Cop!), while another friend has a painted forest scenery. I also see Pok√©mon art every so often.. It's their preference what... i usually use the landscape photo i took as wallpaper.. 

My campmate have Yoona as his wallpaper + profile pic on all social media for years.. recently just switched to Itzy member... its a secret agenda to trigger cucks. I knew a guy in NS who practiced drawing so he could draw his own anime girls. 

He was a rather odd fellow.

He once told me he liked the quiet submissive type anime girls like the Evangelion Rei because the 'stronger' tsudere types was harder to get. I was like what the fuck dude, how messed up are you that you're afraid anime girls would reject you. 

I bet hes like some master hentai artist now. He definitely drew a ton of porn.. You know, what you said makes sense. But there's a bigger problem. And I couldn't figure out why.

The problem is: ""Why are you so interested in what other people put as their whatsapp/phone background?""

Pardon me, but the only person I know who would be interested in a guy's phone backgroud is his girlfriend. And that's becaude usually they want the background to be their pair photos.

So I could not figure out why you, a guy in NS, would be interested in someone else's phone background.

Unless of course it's because you're bored out of your mind in NS. That I would understand.. I mean I only have one or two friends who do that.... Is there any way to check the demographic of a specific thread on Reddit?. when i was in NS, my handphone is in black & white dot matrix LCD so can't have wallpaper.

Now my wallpaper is Tifa from Final Fantasy 7 and she's 3D though...with a bust size to boot.. Weeebs. My wallpaper is an R34 gtr. Can anot bro? Is it too weird? Should I change to something else? Pls advise. Are u sure its not their siambu. Because that's what they like. You have a problem with it?. What's yours than?. i'm in this post and i don't like it. They are doing it for you so that you can see when you message them. You cant see your own profile picture all the time anyway.. Haha, I used to put Kpop Girls as my Wallpaper but recently switched to BTS Save Me as my wallpaper. Otherwise theres no guy who would put a wallpaper of scenery because they don't have an SO. Why does it concern you? They can have whatever picture they like as their background. It's their phones, not yours.. It's the new age of sheltered emasculated Kpop, anime, video game playings weebs who spend their parents' money chasing fickle trends.. Weebism isn't a desirable trait in males lol...my friends and I consider it a red flag in a guy unless he has some other redeeming factors (like he appears to be a mentally normal guy, or he has heathy hobbies like sports and volunteering)

Truth hurts, but if you're an unhygienic or overweight male whose ONLY interests are anime or video gaming... lol, eww, there are better choices tbh. Probably their fap material since porn is banned inside.. I‚Äôm in IT and a lot of men do that. TBH? It‚Äôs weird and quite a turn off. I‚Äôve asked one of them before and he just shrugged.. very bizarre phenomenon. It is indicative of a socially regressive culture, which discourages intimate connections with women, and rewards involuntary celibacy. I have a friend whos like that, and every now and then i poke fun at him, although we are still best mates rofl. Seriously, if you're an adult and you partake in that kind of childlike nonsense, i believe i do have the right to mock you a little bit.. You know, you could just ask them that question, since you mentioned that you are section mates.

But while you are here, lets entertain your question: the real reason why straight men put pretty girls as their phone background is as obvious as the reason is.

If you want to go into the social-cultural climate of why it became this way, then I suggest you read up about NEETs in Korea and Japan. It happens in Singapore too, albeit to a lesser extent. Simply put, the fact that we are more conservative in respect to sex as compared to the western culture led to this situation in Singapore.. 2D girls will not betray or cheat us. Men of quality I see. 2D > 3D. I prefer 34D girls. 3DPD.. 2D girls are clean shaven xD. r/waifuism. Whys that cringe sounds pretty memey if you ask me. HAHAHAHAHA. can confirm.. am NSF with kpop girl as wallpaper. bet they wear uniqlo cloths and nike shoes when they're outside camp. Miraie. Do teenagers still play dota nowadays? Whenever im in game, all i hear is pinoys or indonesians, if im in a lan shop , i hardly find anyone playing it as well. There is some truth to this. Dunno who SG hot influencers?

Maybe ex Skarf Tasha & Ferlyn?. Ask jianhao tan or noc lor. Naa, enterprise is best girl. Prinz bestest girl. It's fucking hilarious reading them. Lmao sia ya. might b him n his chiobu gf + photos from his travels in EU/US. I really want to know this of OP u/Echokaph. didn't this game stop being cool like 5 years ago. I shall not judge people by the content of their wallpaper. i know maybe 2 or 3 people that set a photo of themselves as their background not remotely close to 90%. but sure go ahead and make up your own statistics to make a point.. NPNT. That is a name that I haven heard in a long while liao. lemme guess.. ryujin?. Rei isn't submissive though she literally slapped Shinji lol

Mmn maybe he was talking about rl preferences with that one? Most people, even master hentai artists, would still go for 3d girls eventually I guess. But yeah I wouldn't go for tsundere Asuka either I'd like my waifus to not abuse me thanks.. Literally 0 people have been interested in my phone wallpaper, which is the samsung factory default. Not my girlfriend or any of my exes. If the girl i date somehow prioritises me having our picture as the wallpaper I'd think she's dumb as fuck. BNR32 better car  


\#wangan. kek. >Truth hurts, but if you're an unhygienic or overweight male ~~whose ONLY interests are anime or video gaming~~ lol, eww, there are better choices tbh

Ftfy

Wonder why there are so many incels and bbfa. oof, get some upvote. Turn off because the 2d waifus look better than the real one?. yes because only hobbies you like are valid hahahahahahaha shut the fuck up. Pretty much agreed, though I'd prefer sympathy over mockery.

Personally I enjoy plenty of anime and all, and hence can appreciate the appeal of 2D characters. But I can tell that people who obsess over anime characters, etc., are from a certain perspective compensating for something they did not get IRL.. The amount of downvotes you get explain why there's so many bbfa on this sub. Yes, it's unfair that you can't get dates because of your hobbies and interests, but that's how the game is played and unless you have attributes like being tall, handsome and/or amdk to negate your weebness then don't be surprised if you stay single deep in your 20s.. Idk why you're downvoted but this is the truth. A lot of these guys never really learnt how to navigate the social aspect of dating so they just ""gave up"" and showered affection into Kpop idols. After all, your Kpop idol/anime poster can't reject you. Same goes for pictures of female anime characters. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with liking anime or kpop though and there are a lot of guys who like those but at the same time managed to maintain healthy romantic relationships but its pretty telling how an overwhelming amount of socially reclusive men turn to anime/kpop. It gets unhealthy when anime/kpop starts to become a coping mechanism from a mere hobby. 

I wonder if this is a residue effect of a socially conservative society where men who are expected to conform to be in hetero-relationships and those who are left behind often feel like pariahs and turn to kpop/anime as a safe place. I think this can happen to women as well but to a lesser extent probably. I have actually met a few women who do this and they are also mostly single. 

And NS does nothing to help this when you get virtually zero opportunity to meet women.. 2D girls never ask for anything and will always be there for us.. PTSD sorry wrong place. Excuse me I'll have you know that some of us wear new balance

Not all of us have perfect feet. Ugh so basic /s. Can you blame us? Uniqlo clothing too comfy.. Ahh I know where this came from..... And have some hobby or play some sport?. Fuck I'm guilty.... confirm watch netflix, anime or dota, then got free time play sports or volunteer lor. what...whats wrong with uniqlo and nikes?. Joke‚Äôs on you I bought my clothes from Giordano.. > bet they wear uniqlo cloths and nike shoes

*looks down*

How did you know?! Haven't been a teenager for over a decade though, this is my office attire.. Cleveland represent. Satki la amdk. some would say 10, some 12.... Correct, but it's cool now because of CoD Mobile lol. The same can be said of you. That you're making up the statistic of 70%. I think you don‚Äôt get the irony here. I made up the statistics of 90 percent because you made up the 70 percent.. yuna actually. Og Asuka is pretty bad. Misato is gud tho.. I‚Äôm saying from a girls perspective.. waifus and kpop idols are manufactured by industry to project a compliant, affectionate image where they'll love you no matter who you are. look at the recent trend of slave waifus in isekai anime. it's all a plot by The Man. if it makes money (figurines, concert tickets), they will come, and by god, they'll do anything in their power to increase their profit margins.. > I wonder if this is a residue effect of a socially conservative society where men who are expected to conform to be in hetero-relationships and those who are left behind often feel like pariahs and turn to kpop/anime as a safe place.

I agree. but i think its incumbent on the individual to try and better himself. instead of blaming society. If someone is born ugly, i don't fault that person at all. But if they refuse to put in the effort to connect with people, theres nothing i can do. Social conservatism is a plague, and ruins everything that is pure and good in this world.. 2D girls don't have mood swings. more like new balance is the one you can redeem for credits at emart lmao. Buy from emart too, might as well use those credits. Wait til you become a NSman. Then you will start going to kopitiam to eat breakfast in PT kit and SAF sandals..

He volunteered the info about being from an international school to explain why and how he doesn‚Äôt understand a phenomenon but you took that and honed in on it and disparaged the demographic that he‚Äôs in. Of course he‚Äôs gonna be defensive.. wow he must really like that name heh. dalla dalla~. Ftfy singular girl's perspective

I have friends who got together and get married after attending anime conventions and found their other half as well as couples who debate together on the best waifus

Soooooo. This is depressingly true. As long as there is a demand for something, there will be a supply. 2D girls don‚Äôt smell weird. I'm that dumb fuck who spent my own money buying them thinking it was retro-chic only to be described as that ""uncle who comes for a wedding in a shirt, jeans and sneakers because he doesn't have a suit"".

It was a casual wedding at a voiddeck in my defence.. Someone call the fire department hahahahah. Already ORD‚Äôd.

Never liked walking around in sandals too much though. Still preferred running shoes. Bruh i go orchard in admin attire.. Jin comfortable lor, not so about the sandals though. San deego best girl. thanks mate. Reading in between the line, he is calling Singaporean NSF who don't go to international schools losers for having these pics.. So what? I‚Äôm talking about from my perspective.. 2D girls have twintails. Yikes, as in the actual one being sold at emarts?

Hahaha, well at least they're really comfy.. i always thought the saf sandals were pretty low tier. i find them comfortable enough. The cost-to-value ratio cannot be beat.. [Headnod]. My secretary right now. You just can't feel down when she's around. Welcome to reddit. 2D girls dont have imperfections. No la haha. Classic 574s.. They were okay. Not bad, but not the best.

They were comfortable enough to use on a daily basis, but not enough to use all the time. For me the saf sandal always bite into my skin so I seldom wear them other than once a year. 

Maybe cos too new since I end up get annoyed and threw them away at the end of the cycle. Oh you don‚Äôt have to get so butthurt about it. It‚Äôs not personal.. 2D girls dont love you based on looks. I have to say they're the **most** un-comfiest sandals I have worn. I once had the suay-ness to get a plantar wart right in the middle of the big toe, and I got ""excused footwear"" from the MO and some tetracycline. I just meh and eschewed the excuse as the sandal keep bumping the wart causing annoying pain. By comparison the no. 4 boot's padding is way softer and comfier. It was non-Goretex boots, full leather. Altama, I believe it was called. Soft sole liner with good arch support. The cushioning helped to 'absorb' the bumps and allowed me to walk normally, no need to avoid stepping on the wart. If I wore the sandals, I keep getting those unavoidable bumps, ""zzzt! Ow, pain lah, ciiibai!""

Anyway, the cream did jack shit. So I went to polyclinic, got referred to hospital (I forgot which hospital) and told the doc about it. He did that ""Hhhhh"" laugh when I mentioned the tetracycline and set me up to remove the wart via liquid N‚ÇÇ and scalpel. Bonus point for using 11B to foot the bill. Screw you, MO.

Apparently, MOs are notorious for downplaying medical severities. Two whole months, I rubbed that snake oil on my toe.... Think about what you wrote and read your own replies. Sure thing u flower. Haha. 2D girls never let you down. Mmm you'd think an MO would know antibiotics does nothing to warts.. Ya, I only bought those sandals to reservist but for everyday usage,  I use other sandals instead. I do not think that I have said anything wrong. You on the other hand, saw a need to tell me about how your friends still manage to be married despite of it. For what? ... Ok?. Yeah haha. That's why the doctor's ""Hhhh..!"" was *totally* warranted.. Signs of denial, check
More explanation than deemed required, check
Extrapolation of own feelings onto others, check
I can provide my perspective but others can't, check
I can generalize and do stereotypes but others can't, check

If you think u said nothing wrong, why do u think I said something wrong?

You saw a need to tell everyone you work in IT, which no one asked for, stereotyped men, get all defensive and angsty, and provided with alternate perspective from another person, you get all touchy and claim the alternative perspective is butt hurt.

Ok sweety, cheers to the time of the month which is the only explanation u can use to get yourself out of the amount of "" butthurt"" u are showing.

I do love myself a little banter now and then. Especially when you get to use others words against themselves.

I didnt even down vote you but why are u so butthurt that you place all that down voted grievances onto the only person providing u with their perspective, sounds familiar? Hahahahahah

I forgot this, you gave your own perspective, for what?.... Ok?. It‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm pretty sure somewhere, someone out there finds you desirable.. Still so butt hurt you try personal attacks, which fail but reveal the fact you are a lady working in IT, single, and with your character, probably forever will be.

More please, this is fun.

Actual neutral question though, how did u even get into IT with that logic u have there? By personally finding the flaws of your interviewer and attacking them during the interview?

Next you be targeting my supposed waifu wallpaper on my phone, which I don't have? HAHAHAHA. Funny, because I am actually in a relationship.

Can‚Äôt say the same for you though, based on how invested you seem to be on defending yourself.. Funny? Look who started the personal attacks, awww.

Congrats you are in a relationship, let me know when u actually settle with that lovable character u have.

From the first reply to your last, anyone else can tell u who is the one trying to defend themself.

Cute.. When did I personally attacked you? LOL

Hahaha, thanks though. I‚Äôm actually quite well liked. So I don‚Äôt really care what strangers on the Internet think about me. 

Have a good single and long life though.. Aww good single and long life, are u referring to yourself soon?
Too much personal information.

I'm sure you don't, given your replies which stray further and further away from who you think others inteprete you as :)

When in doubt about yourself, go back to the checklist I made for you dear.. Interpret me from my preference for men (that I don‚Äôt fancy men who have kpop/anime girls as their dp)? Oh no, I‚Äôm so afraid of them finding out the true me.

Cheers >:). Once again, refer to the checklist.

91,which credit cards are available?,dkh62r,2019-10-20 08:56:51,"Hi /r/singapore

Coming straight from /r/CreditCards and I was told that most of the requirements aren't the same outside the US.

I'm Swiss citizen and I'll relocate next week to Singapore. I'll travel a lot for work and my goal is to get one of those cards:

* CSR Reserve
* Citi Prestige
* Amex Platinum

My current learning is that Singapore citizens can apply for the Citi Prestige and the Amex Platinum.

* [](
* [\_cards/credit-card.htm](

Originally I planned to get the CSR Reserve since the benefits align best. I assume though that the CSR Reserve is not available for non US citizen in Singapore. Is that correct? I do have an employment pass and a good salary and no history with depts in credit cards (Swiss credit cards though). Am I correct that I can apply for Citi Prestige and Amex Platinum if I fulfill the requirements?

&#x200B;

Thanks for helping me out.",0,0.48,16.0,"too high ses question for us peasants

serious answer: the eligibility criteria is stated clearly in the respective sites‚Ä¶ if you meet the conditions there shouldn't be an issue getting the card‚Ä¶ however, the more troublesome part would be a proof of address. Google would easily answer all of your questions. 

- Chase cards are not available in Singapore, citizen or not
- yes, you can apply for Citi Prestige or Amex Platinum, but those are not the best cards available locally for air miles, rebates, or general benefits. I love my AMEX platinum mostly for the dining discounts, membership privileges (being able to go to Tower Club in RP during lunch break is incredible) and the concierge service. You can look into the AMEX SIA credit cards if you're looking for travel perks, but I don't think it's the best card if you're looking for miles.. You should also note that not only are the requirements different, but the benefits and annual fees are also different from the other versions of those cards. Typically the annual fees here are much higher and the benefits are lower for the same card. So advice from people in other countries isn't really helpful.

As you seem to be looking to earn miles, you might also want to research the earn rates of the cards and transfer partners of the various banks (especially if you have significant miles with a programme currently). Typically the higher tier cards here (like the ones you are interested in) don't earn as much miles as mass-market miles cards. 

Then again, all of this is putting the cart in front of the horse. Just because a good card exists and you satisfy all stated requirements doesn't mean you will be approved. You should figure out which banks are willing to give you which cards, and really the only way to do that is to ask the banks yourself.

The Prestige card here has 1 thing going for it: the 4th-night free benefit has not *yet* been capped to twice a year.

Not sure how it is in other countries, but there are 3 Amex cards with the word ""Platinum"" in the name here, 2 credit (Amex Platinum CC, Amex Platinum Reserve CC) and 1 charge (Amex Platinum Charge Card aka The Platinum Card).. Visa.. thanks. Why do you think proof of address is difficult? Shouldn't this be easy with a copy of the tenant agreement signed by the landlord?. which card is the best in your opinion? Thanks for the reply.. Not sure why you're getting downvoted, but Visa/Mastercard is more widely accepted here.

Hell, I think I've seen more places that accept JCB than Amex.. AFAIK it needs to be some form of bill (utilities, telco, etc.) or bank statement that is addressed to your name and mailing address‚Ä¶. Get your bill 1st ,in the mean time you could use your amex card. Nope, you need the 'official' tenant agreement issued by either HDB, or in your case I assume if you're renting private, you need an e-stamped document from IRAS and yes, you or the houseowner need to pay a stamp fee for that. 

Maybe you can negotiate to split the fee and both keep a photocopy of the 'official' document for all these verification purposes.

So you kindda need this document before you can open bank account or signup for a telco plan (iirc).. as long as amex dun change their t&c for grab top up lol. This is wrong. A copy of the tenancy agreement will be fine for any credit card provider.

Edit: lol u/Neptunera - instead of downvoting me why don‚Äôt you look up what the requirements are before spewing incorrect info online. I have credit cards with proof of address being the first page of my tenancy agreement. Your ego is bigger than your brain.. Nope, pretty sure you're wrong, or at least the banks & organisations I've researched on want to cover their ass with a more 'legit document'. That's what happened when a foreign friend of mine tried to apply with his FIN & signed tenancy agreement.

Hell, most banks doesn't even accept tenancy agreement any more.

Maybank :

>Proof of Mailing Address (i.e. Utility/Telco/Bank statement with another bank in Singapore) where name must be the same as your Passport and Employment Pass 

Citibank :

>A photocopy of resident proof such as utility bill, telephone bill or Bank statement with applicant's name and address

OCBC :

>Additional documents

>Include any one of the following documents:

    Phone bill
    Half-yearly CPF statement
    Any bank statement

OUB : 

>Proof of residential address (such as the latest telephone/utilities bill or latest bank statement; all documents to be in English).

Standard Chartered is vague, but requests proof of residence.

DBS/POSB doesn't accept tenenacy agreement like most banks listed.

For good reasons too, because anyone can just scribble


>I, Xiaoming, agree to rent apartment ABC #01-23 to John McJohn

But requesting a copy from HDB/IRAS requires some level of authentication with the respective agencies.. I speak from personal experience with cards from DBS, UOB, Citi, and Amex. When I went through the documentation process for all except DBS, it was accepted.. My friend in question needed to wait an additional month for his Citibank application.

On an unrelated note, for SG/PRs updating their NRIC address @ Police posts, tenenacy agreement is accepted but only from HDB/IRAS.",888.0,5,144,1
92,Current Thoughts on SGSecure?,dkgz1c,2019-10-20 08:32:02,"First post here; me and a couple of mates are doing a project on Cyber Literacy, and so far we have gathered sources from 100% definitely non-biased Singaporean News sites.  However, now we want the humble opinion of the Singaporeans of Reddit. Just like Blizzard's motto: every voice matters (terms & conditions apply)",19,0.78,16.0,"Nice try, SGSecure.. > (terms & conditions apply) 

I wonder why Blitzchung got kicked..... Ask any nsf this. Okay, like /u/DarthDanial said, SGSecure not just the app, but the movement - but the App is like one key part of the movement.

While being generally prepared for disasters or unforseen circumstances are great, the app currently is fundamentally flawed because it doesn't take into account of reality.

Let's just say - touch wood - you witness a car accident while you were at the kopitiam having your lunch...

Sure, you can use the app to make an emergency call, but wouldn't it be easier to just dial 995/999? I believe everyone probably has these numbers drilled into them from years of NE days. 

Signing up as a first-aid / firefighting responder through the app is a good thing, and undoubtedly we could probably do a lot of good if everyone who has these skills signed up through the app and try to respond to emergencies around them in real time, but once again, it does not really fit into the reality of things.

If you see an uncle collapse, for example, your first instinct would to be checking up on him and maybe calling an ambulance, but who would really go into the app and ask for help like calling a Grabcar. 

I guess one of the good things if you have the app would be to use it to SMS police in case you were held hostage and cannot make noise while in hiding...? 

Then again you can just google ""sms police number"", which I did right now for this point, it's 71999 btw. 

Overall, the application is lacking because we're not used to the idea of it yet, and using phone numbers / sms would be way more convinient (What if no data or no signal? At least phonecall/sms still can work for emergency services.)

And also the absolute meme it had become after NSFs / other civil servants got forced to download it, allegedly.. My impressions of SG secure is from the ad before every movie in cinemas... talking abt the importance of CPR... 

Seems like they shifted the focus from terrorism to this.. if you happen to be at the west and hav time, there‚Äôs actually a SG Secure roadshow outside Jurong Point going on till 9pm today. An opportune occasion to gather all you need at one go xD

edit: but imo, its a good attempt by the government to level up home security. it‚Äôs jus the user base may still be limited just to the tech savvy bunch.. It must be understood that sgsecure is not an app.  Its actually a national movement to mobilise the civilian populace, the sgsecure app being one of its instruments. 

While I can get behind the idea of the sgsecure movement, the app itself leaves alot to be desired.. i keep my phone free of filth so i can take more food pics (no nasi lemak). What is 100% non biased?

No such thing as non biased media la. What else do you wanna know?. Dammit, you caught me right in the act.. Thanks for the answer, we'll be sure to put this in. Yes, that was the joke I was hinting at..

94,SSDC or BBDC for Class 2A?,dkfwey,2019-10-20 06:15:41,I'm coming back to Singapore during my summer break from my studies. And I wish to clear my 2A license within like 2 months. Which one is faster? And how long did it take you guys to complete your 2A journey?,3,0.64,14.0,"Depends on which center is nearer to your accomodation. Class 2A : 3 Months (SSDC)
, Enrol : 2017 Jan,
Got 2A on first attempt : 2017 Mar,
, When booking Next available lesson waiting time is at least two weeks 

Class 2 : 1 Month (BBDC)
, Enrol:2018 Mar 
, Got 2 on first attempt : 2018 Apr 
, Completed all lesson within one week then waited for TP and got it in less then 4 weeks if I remb correctly. Yeah I did 2A at BBDC within a month.. Got my 2A at SSDC in 1 month, could've gotten it within 3 weeks if i did not delay my theory lesson.. I cleared my class 2A and 2 at BBDC, finished all my practical lessons in a week and the TP was just 1.5 weeks later, it might not be the cheapest option but they were really fast and class slots were always available. 

The next part is subjective but I think BBDC has a higher passing rate (IIRC), they also have pretty decent quality bikes that are pretty well maintained, instructors mostly is about luck... but are generally pretty knowledgeable about using proper technique. Most people clear class 2A/2 in about a month so it‚Äôs really quite fast game (assuming you not bobo rider). As someone said before, biggest factor is traveling distance to the school.. Just curious, why is cdc not considered for 2A/2. I cleared my class 2 at ssdc in about a month'ish. Don't see why you have to go to bbdc if it's not going to make a difference. Plus, you grad your 2b from ssdc so you're already familiar with the circuit and facilities, that's a plus imo.. I live in Woodlands and took my 2B in SSDC, however I heard BBDC is faster and more frequent when it comes to practical sessions and TP. 

I wonder how true is that.. I guess this is a no brainer, BBDC is so much faster. It‚Äôs too far for me. BBDC practical lessons you can only book a maximum of 3 or 4 classes a week, from the school slot sell. However, if you're lucky, you can purchase slots that other users sell off, and if you're really lucky like when I did my practical tests, you can get a bulk of slots and finish 12 lessons in a week. I‚Äôve never had to wait for lessons for BBDC. If I wanted to go the next day I‚Äôll just book the night before. Off peak lessons are usually more popular so you have to book early. TP test was about 3 weeks waiting list. (July 2019)

I‚Äôve also met people who cleared lessons and evaluation in one week.. But then 2A only requires 3 practicals. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna be a problem. Oh true, I was thinking about Class 3",472.0,6,41,1
95,"What salary and benefits do Singaporean Military Experts , Warrant officers and officers get ?",dkfuwm,2019-10-20 06:10:46,"So last time I asked the question "" What benefits do Singapore military members get"" here as part of a personal project I'm doing on Militaries of different countries . Basically Military politics , salary & benefits , soldier Quality of life , morale etc .


And the post didn't go quite well .... because I didn't mention  that I specifically meant career and volunteer soldiers instead of conscripts  .",15,0.6,19.0,"The keyword for Singapore is ‚Äúregulars‚Äù. Don‚Äôt know anything to help you with the rest of your question though.. It's a stable job with a livable income, but don't expect too much either. Many who retire from the force find it difficult to find jobs in the private sector because they don't really pick up much transferable skills. Most of it is actually just glorified office work that happens in a defence setting.. remember to include the SAVER plan which is the closest thing to a pension system in sg. its a pumped up CPF plan for them to recognise that they are unlikely to have a 2nd career after leaving the forces. IIRC it's at least a 2k/mth for ME1s/Sergeants. ALong with a hefty sign of bonus that's meant to pretty much make sure you have no immediate financial worries.

Your pay varies depending on not just your rank, but also your appointment, location of posting, and other factors. 

Some links for reference:

Regular Officers pay (2LT to Captain): 


NCO pay (only shown for 3SGs, however):  My 2sg friend in service vocation gets 2k after CPF. Pay-wise I think google is your best bet. 

As for the rest:

CEP is heavily based off academics and scholars climb ranks much faster than their more experienced (and perhaps) more capable counterparts, hence the term 'paper generals'. Many scholars go into politics at a ministerial or vice-minestrial level after retirement from service. However, it is important to note there are many different scholarship tiers and only the top tier scholarships like the SAF Overseas Scholars programme ensures at least a BG rank.

As for MEs, ranks run parallel with the conventional ones. ME4 and above are officer level ranks whilst ME3s are WOs and ME2 and ME1 are Sgts. Main difference between MEs and the norm are that retirement age is increased to 60. This also means promotions are slower as appointments are cycled longer. 

There are schemes for WOs too, however these are often less lucrative than those for officers.

Another key personnel to the SAF you have left out are the DXOs(Defence executive officers) which are civilian administrative officers that handle some aspects of office work. Depending on appointment, these ranks can run up to DX15, equivalent to MG. Many of them are regulars who have hit retirement age but chose to remain in the service.

As for politics in the office, it sorta goes as in the civillian workplace and differs from unit to unit. One key difference is that there is a lot more bootlicking or angkat bola-ing (malay for ball holding) which breeds bad blood amongst coworkers. This is especially so in the context of Singapore's competitive society. Of course there is significantly more wastage of resources  and red-tape bureaucracy as opposed to the private sector, typical of all government services. Also, security has recently become an utmost concern due to several high profile leakages of data to date. However, for the most part, the SAF still functions relatively efficiently given her size.

Morale amongst regulars are usually high in the young blood who haven't hit their cep whereas the older ones who have tend to become more lacklustre and spiteful. There IS plenty of revolutionary spirit amongst the younger officers towards the outdated promotion system and the like but this (for the most part) amounts to nothing much as those who do hold this attitude tend to leave the service early. 

As for benefits, free healthcare, insurance and better treatment as compared to conscripts in camp are some. Others may include better rates at some establishments and memberships etc but there isn't really much appreciation by the public as compared to countries with fully professional armies as most men have served. 

As for work life balance, I'd say this depends on rank, appointment and personal alignment. Those in higher ranks and appointments have a heavier workload and thus, have more OT etc. As for this aspect, it is quite improbable to draw a reliable gauge as most career soldiers have only worked in the SAF and thus, cannot compare the experience to the private sector. The SAF does employ several techniques to help servicemen in regard to their mental health but Singapore's conservative outlook on such issues dissuade them from seeking help. This is characterised by a multitude of suicides that happen in camp. Whilst the situation is improving, this is more of a Singapore problem rather than an SAF problem and I'd say that the SAF has employed much more avenues to help her employees more so than in the private sector.

These are just some of the opinions I have as an nsf that works closely and interacts with many regulars on the daily. While some of the information may be biased given my status as a conscript, I think most regulars I have spoken to hold the same thinking. However, it is important to note that many of these opinions are shaped by the culture of the unit and respective workplace. For the most part, I'd have to agree with a fellow commenter that most singaporean regulars work a typical 9-5 with the added aspect of having to don a uniform. Instead, if you're looking for a combatant's/trooper's outlook or the SAF I think itd be better to ask the NSFs as most of the footmen are made up of conscripts.

Hope this helped in that project of yours :). Climb up to the top echelons and you might get a backdoor entry into a more corporate SMRT and SPH. 

Unfortunately NOL no longer applies.. Ah, so you wanted the minority opinion. Understandable that that would be different.. Is it the lump sum cpf money they get when they retire. Do they also get degrees and education sponsorship ? And does it always have to be related to the job ?. >SMRT and SPH

What's that ? P.S I'm not Singaporean so I'm not so knowledgeable about the terms. IIRC you get those if you are a 2LT/LT and is gunning for higher ranks. The last time I saw the 'list of degrees' back in BMT it was pretty expansive. I believe Engineering degrees will generally be more relevant for the Navy and Air Force.. Having the armed forces pay for your education (partially or in full) is one of the key attraction points. You can look into the different awards and scholarships that the SAF offers.

For example, Officers can apply for the Local Study Award where they give you a lump sum to cover some of your education fees. There are also scholarships that pay your monthly tuition fee, or better yet, cover your monthly tuition fee AND continue paying your salary.

The degree doesn‚Äôt have to be related to what you do, but the institution/course must be one that is approved by them.

Also, whatever figures you see on the website excludes the bonuses that Regulars receive. There‚Äôs mid-year, end-year and performance bonus. Or, if you decide to forego any sponsorship or study award, you receive a sign-on bonus.

Money all around, really.. If you need to know about degree sponsorship, these should be of help for you:  (can apply either pre-uni for full sponsorship or mid-term for 60%, these are the more traditional scholarships, afaik no need for related degree)

 (a more exhaustive list incl specific career paths and NCOs)

SAF Scholarship = Overseas studies only, formerly known as SAFOS, 2nd most prestigious scholarship in Singapore behind President's Scholar. I think they give <10 of these a year, get one and you're guaranteed to be a BSD of SAF in 10 years time.

SAF Merit Scholarship = Overseas only, lower than the SAF Scholarship but still good chance to be a BSD. Iirc it's the top scholarship available to women, I knew one who went to LSE to study Pol Sci on this. Tuition fully paid, and with the salary + benefits she was getting extra of high-$3K a month just for studying.

SAS = SAF Academic Scholarship, can be for local or overseas. Not sure of the specific benefits.

LSA = Local Study Award. If you sign on, usually will auto-get this if you're studying a local public uni. A friend of mine studied Psychology at NUS on this. Note that every scheme here includes rank-based salary during your time of study (usually LTA rank). I remember a recruitment talk that outlined a starting pay scheme based on your degree honours: $3.8K (2nd lower class), $4.2K (2nd upper class), $4.6K (1st class)

Edit: Saw that you're not a local. If you have any questions on the terms used, happy to answer. SMRT is a major local transport operator, Singapore Press Holdings is a major media publisher, both with strong government ties. The trend is that high-ranking military officials here are usually moved into cushy C-suite jobs after their service (e.g. the CEOs of both these companies, among others). Google search CEO SMRT and CEO SPH and you will find the similarities.. Whoah ! That sounds awesome from a Civilian perspective hehe. Hahaha more like awesome from a military perspective. The general complaint from most Singaporeans is that these military CEOs aren't a fit for the job, they're just there to get paid. Not a military state by far, but shades of it. NOL under Ng Yat Chung is a good classic example.

97,What's with Singaporeans' unhealthy competitiveness?,dkfnar,2019-10-20 05:45:01,"This text might offend some but I think it should be discussed.

Competition is good, it spurs people to improve themselves and it is a motivator for people to excel in work/studies.

But my pet peeve is how competitiveness in Singapore unhealthily extends to outside of work/studies. For example:

Lane-cutting on the roads to overtake even though the person isn't late for work

Relatives one-upping over the other during CNY to prove that their children are better

Micro-aggressions by some Singaporeans to prove that they are right

Must be first in queuing over the latest trend for social media likes 

Holding lavish weddings and sharing them on social media to showcase wealth and probably outshine others

Comparing the 5Cs here and there

Speeding up when you need to change lane

Rushing for MRT seats",448,0.95,203.0,"Replace competitiveness with ego. And you have your answer to most of the questions. Singaporeans have high ego.. I am guessing unmet emotions. Most feel they are not validated, because only the ‚Äòbest‚Äô gets the validation (recognition and affection), and mathematically, the ‚Äòbest‚Äô are the minority. Probably the hidden side effect of a meritocracy-based society.

Unfortunately, they are not aware that they are obsessed with the best or being the best, and hence, this obsession crosses over to all facets of their lives unconsciously. 

Personally, I‚Äôve hardly come across Singaporeans who could appreciate the journey, rather than obsessing with the goal. Even those who think they appreciate the journey has the goal in mind, and the goal is still shaped by some kind of competitiveness.

For example, many live by a bucket list (an idea which I never really found useful), and for many, that list is largely influenced by going for unique things ‚Äì competition in itself, to be the minority. Most tellingly, notice how many tend to describe their travels with ‚Äúit has the best ______‚Äù.. Small nation, dense population, not much to go around, unhealthy expectations. High-requirements or volatile jobs like doctor, lawyer, stock broker, business manager expected to be the norm or even 'requirement' to a good life.. In other cultures, being ""kiasu"" is seen as negative behavior. Here, as a nation we take pride in it. No surprise it leads to unhealthy habits developing for some.

That aside, I disagree with the majority of the examples you shared. Lavish weddings is very much an Asian concept, not exclusive to Singapore. Social media like farming is a well-observed trend everywhere.. Sinkie must pwn sinkie if not cannot sleep at night.. Relatives one-upping over the other during CNY to prove that their children are better

Micro-aggressions by some Singaporeans to prove that they are right

Comparing the 5Cs here and there

- Fk'em. Just do your own thing.. I think it‚Äôs how Singapore was built, over the 50 odd years. A first world country was born. Thus everyone, or most, have the mindset that if you‚Äôre first, then only you‚Äôll make it. We live so fast we forget what it‚Äôs like to take a step back and let someone else go first. 

We are built around ego, the government also have their own ego, trying to step into public‚Äôs life thinking its for the country‚Äôs best or the public‚Äôs interest. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm making any sense but if you tried to live at other country , New Zealand/Aus/Finland and such, you‚Äôll then realise what happens when you move just a step slower and relax.

In sg we think that if we got the fastest car, the biggest house or the highest GPA, then we‚Äôll make it like Imran. 

Then we end up in MLM scams and then that‚Äôs where most young adults think to not trust anyone and live their life for themselves , not sharing , not caring but just want to be the best. 

TLDR : too much ego, too fast country , don‚Äôt trust Imran.. because happiness and contentment from within is the strangest concept to grasp for citizens living and working in the 2nd hardest-working city in the world. 

here's an exercise: tell others that you truly are happy just being and having what you have. That you have enough and don't desire further luxuries in life. Note their responses. Most will be perplexed but out of politeness will give the customary 'that's great, good for you' but you obviously sense their disturbance. Those bolder, or closer to you will question  your unconventional/defeatist/mediocre mentality  and end up challenging you to be well... more competitive.. >This text might offend some but I think it should be discussed.

everyone thinks it, you dared to say it. 100% agreed too.. Competitiveness in terms of material comforts are what Singaporeans strive towards achieving as their purpose in life. Life needs meaning, for most Singaporeans that meaning comes from doing better than someone else, in terms of studies, career, salary, etc. Most people never questioned what that meaning implies, satisfied with the pre-ordained meaning epoused by Singaporean society. Trapped within this complex by peers who edge them on towards a more ""success"", in a well-structured society that enables such behaviour, the ""sinkie"" is a person who acts, but doesn't think. 

Thinking about what this means, about whether ""success"" is worth it, is discouraged by the ""pragmatic"" approach encouraged by the Singapore government. Anyone who even attempts to ask, for once, what is the point of it all, is often told by his social circle to ""stop talking cock"", ""be grateful you are born in Singapore"", ""what a pretensious wank"", in addition to other prejoratives heaped upon him. He often just gives up and follows along, or immigrate, leaving the people who are content with Singapore as such to remain here. 

Honestly, Singapore is a small city. What else do we have other than to compete in our careers? There is no escape other than to work, our leisure is limited to shopping malls and NParks. Of course we compete. That is the way we show our plumage to our peers, a gesturing contest for superiority in a admittedly small stage. 

We look down upon our cultural scene with distate, the ""unemployed artist"", the ""bugger-flipping painter"", the ""you want to work at McDonald's is it?"" careers that no one wants to attempt. What else is there than? Without arts, without culture, only cold, hard economics, facts and figures, capitalism becomes our only arena. We don't celebrate the poor, but thoughtful artist. We celebrate the artist that makes money. Economics. In a society with only one arena to succeed, only a small amount reach the top, driving the rest to claw ever moreso desperately to become one of them. Only when we acknowledge alternate means to success can we alleviate the competitive state of Singapore society.. People like to one-up others to make themselves feel better. In office work setting people ask about you not out of concern, but more of info gathering. They don't care, nor want to hear that you are doing well. They want to get anything on you that make them seem better off then you, so they feel better about their lives.

Chinese people has this culture of comparing with others, usually with relatives, about how well they are doing in life. 

It is always in comparison to people more fortunate then themselves, more money, better job, better family. Always looking up to them and being envious of their lives. Meanwhile anyone less fortunate than themselves, they will shame and ridicule. As if everyone else deserves to be worse off, only they themselves deserves a better life.. The thing I have found is that this competitiveness does not really extend to long term self improvement. As an engineer, you would be amazed at how few locals have the drive to learn to code, learn to cad or learn some subject so that they develop a mastery and deep expert expertise etc.  Then they wonder why their career become chui when they hit age 45 and get retrenched. If it is truly so competitive, why is it so hard to get people to improve themselves? We live in an era where all the information to do this is available online. If you put in the effort, you can learn almost anything. But no. We have one of the lowest productivities of any developed country.   


Only know how to go around bian jiak, Sabo each other, thumb each other down, cat fighting, bullying grab driver/service staff, borrow money to haolian, mis-using your children to haolian etc etc. Anything that results in a real improvement that helps yourself and others as well as improves our country's ability to economically fight and win globally? AWOL.. Unpopular opinion: I don't think we are competitive, especially the younger generation. Many of my angmoh colleagues in finance industry complain about Sinkies junior hires being slackers who can't handle criticism and competition.. Well our elected leader already said that we must steal other people‚Äôs lunch.... Although, I have had a chat with a Korean who came to Singapore to set up a business, because the competition culture is here is less.

But I'd like to hear more opinions, as this lady went back to Korea, so it's like she negated her own words.... Read through all of the replies and I don't feel like anybody's really put their finger on it.

In my opinion, it all started with WW2 ‚Äì an extremely traumatic event ‚Äì and then subsequently post-WW2 economic and social policies instituted by the SG government that were designed to keep the populace terrified of falling behind. Singaporeans have been conditioned for 50+ years to be extremely loss-averse. It's really a sort of national PTSD that nobody talks about much. People inherit the fear and anxiety from their parents and peers. The whole country needs therapy, IMO.. The stress from focusing on work/ studying and societal pressure to compete is unreleased in the wrong ways. If you ain't first, you're last. When can we progress from:

‚ÄúI play to win/I play to gain‚Äù to ‚ÄúI play to sustain‚Äù?

So much brainwashing that every situation‚Äôs a zero-sum game; god-forbid once in a while someone comes along that actually wanna give back to his/her industry to level-up everyone.... I don't think the issue is about competitiveness, but rather what are we competing for. Things like queuing over latest trends, lane cutting, choping seats, etc - these are petty stuff that appeals to the masses because of the low barrier of entry. 

If we take it to the next level, for example, wanting to be the first team bring a sustainable source of clean water to poor nations, or reducing world hunger by 15%- do we think that people will be complaining about the push to excel?

&#x200B;

The problem with most Singaporeans is that we only think about what benefits us while we are still alive. Hardly anybody bother leaving behind a legacy. Gotta earn more money to live a good life, get a pretty wife, live in a big place, etc. Until we have a shift of mindset, this will remain.. it starts when your mum and dad wants you to score highest for PSLE. smol pee pee so must compensate in other areas of life & work. The mindset from the 1960s nation building and super-pragmatic generation.. Lack of humility and cohesiveness, I would say. It's a dog-eat-dog society here.. To be frank, the amount of competitiveness in school is also unhealthy. It's creating toxic stress for students who are unable to 100% follow the syllabus or content.. Serotonin boost in the brain when one-upping another person. It makes one feel happy. It's actually hard-wired in our primitive brains. But I still think those people are assholes.. Why I left Singapore and went back to Malaysia. People in Singapore just so obsessed with one upping each other.

If I stayed and found a spouse there, I am afraid I get sucked into this vicious cycle. I am a simple guy so don't want to compete endlessly with everyone.

My own sister married a SG guy and he splurge his money on wants but then complains endlessly about money. Its so illogical why you want to impress strangers when you are broke in the bank. 

Anyway, I doubt this can be changed, its so deeply built into SG culture.. I can't handle too much toxicity, cut ties with friends and people :(. My mother scolded me for being gorng gorng for giving up my place in a q, to a nice auntie who smelt really nice,  in a crowded Mac.

I grew up learning to never give an inch: on the road, in the train, and even on the bed (sorry my imaginary wife).. This doesn't only happen in Singapore. I think it happens to most countries with Chinese majority population. It's just in the genes to be competitive in everything.. > Lane-cutting on the roads to overtake even though the person isn't late for work

dont think this is really being competitive dude, just jerk driving. there are countries where drivers ignore lane markings entirely 

> Relatives one-upping over the other during CNY to prove that their children are better

one common topic parents talk abt is their children 

> Micro-aggressions by some Singaporeans to prove that they are right

examples? like pple suddenly quoting their life story / academics to prove a point? yeah i can see it in this sub but i dont think they are being competitive, just poor comm skills

> Must be first in queuing over the latest trend for social media likes

this is definitely unhealthy but teens all over the world do this

> Holding lavish weddings and sharing them on social media to showcase wealth and probably outshine others

this is your assumption. weddings usually only happen once and involves many friends. dont see anything wrong in sharing

> Comparing the 5Cs here and there

i haven't seen this term used since 2000 dude. what are the 5Cs now?

> Speeding up when you need to change lane

i m suppose to slow down while changing lanes? again, seems like just bad driving habits

> Rushing for MRT seats

this is just poor social etiquette. dont think there is a competition here

the strange thing is most of the posts here are addressing competition in work and studies though so maybe you have a point somewhere but its lost on this sub. Doctor, lawyer, engineer

The holy Trinity of jobs.

Everything else and you're useless.. Ego. When a country is built upon the foundation of strong business mind structure, what do u expect?. PM say we must steal other people's lunches or they will have theirs stolen.. I literally just saw a driver speed up to overtake a car... In a carpark with single-lane two-way traffic in Chinatown. 

God forbid if he crashes into a lightpole somewhere, can't wait to have one less reckless driver on the roads. What‚Äôs are the 5Cs?. Nothing compared to some SE asia country road & queueing line chaos. I believe the Chinese term ""kiasu"" would be self explanatory.. Indirectly quoting from an article by RICE, the problem is in our culture of pursuing sucess, with reference to comparing our children.. IMO, its all driven from young. From young you have class positions so everyone wants to be the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù. 

I have seen it for myself and young fresh grads joining. Always wanting to excel, be recognized and expect to be promoted after joining for a year.....

Then that‚Äôs where I realized there are even more individuals who are much better than me but not promoted yet.... at the end of the day. Just do your own shit and pass by your day.

If you really want a fast promotion then go play your politics. üôèüèΩ as long as not much OT and not much shit to clean up - I‚Äôm happy!. Personally I'm just super unfit and have a hard time standing for 15 mrt stops. So yeah I'd like to be able to sit down.. Getting into the MRT before those inside have alighted. I FUCKING HATE THIS! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY AUNTIE! I WILL SHOVE YOU!

Sorry... It just happened earlier and I'm still raging about it.... Why do you think the favorite past time for sg is to travel out of the country lol. Isn't this prevalent in other countries. Kinda swiping it with a broad brush.. Most are hardly unique to Singapore. Is it also because we are importing more and more people and therefore it's getting tougher and tougher in everything. Crowded Housing. Jobs. etc. Resulting in us being more and more kiasu?. Is this really only exclusive to sg though?. Insecurity issues. 3rd world citizens who assume that just because they live in a 1st world country, they are, by default.. Kaisu + anything to add to our personal portfolio. The road ones are a time and a tit-for-tat (no one gives way to me so wtf should I give way to others) issue.

The MRT seats one is really just because sitting > standing so it's really more like a resource grab.

The rest are ""face"" issues.. Those who like to compare and prove that they are ""better"" than others, are usually the ones who are least contented with their own lives and are just trying to make themselves feel better by putting others down. The most toxic kind of people to be around because they are the ones who will actually feel happy if something bad happens to you. Cut them away and live your own happy life :). Is this perception applicable to all races in Singapore?. > Lane-cutting on the roads to overtake even though the person isn't late for work 

How do you know that? And i think its very unlikely its due to ""competitiveness"", and more to do with saving time. 

> Relatives one-upping over the other during CNY to prove that their children are better 

I honestly dont think theres anything wrong with parents being proud of their child. of course, some go overboard, but comparing achievements is like a topic of conversation for relatives who meet up rarely during CNY. What else do you want them to talk about, how stupid their child is? 

> Holding lavish weddings and sharing them on social media to showcase wealth and probably outshine others 

If they hold that for others, then theres something wrong but if they can afford to do so, why not? Most people do it to give their wife a good time. You only have 1 wedding in your lifetime (for most people), it should be an occasion to celebrate. 

> Speeding up when you need to change lane 

Arent you supposed to do that when you change to a righter lane? 

> Rushing for MRT seats 

I rush for MRT seats because I hate standing for 30mins squeezing with other people. Not because of ""competitiveness"". I have to compete to get the seat, but that doesnt mean i love competing. I would rather there be an empty train where I dont need to compete for seats.. Usually competitiveness is passed down by parents based on their way of teaching their children, I've noticed this about my own parents and have since given up on appeasing them, cause my improvements are to no help.. First and foremost this is not endemic and exclusive only to Singapore. It comes in other forms elsewhere.

What you listed above is perhaps the more obvious signs of people in Singapore attempting to keep up with the Joneses. In cities known for being densely populated financial centres this is all too common.. Because we're mostly descended from Chinese and we inherited the rotten super-competitive culture from our Chinese ancestors. That's all you really need to know. In contrast, the Malay and Indian Singaporeans I've met and known seem way more laid-back and easygoing. 

Just to be clear: I loathe Chinese culture with a passion. It's oppressive, backwards, and absolutely toxic. I hate being called Chinese, and whenever I'm asked, I'll introduce myself solely as Singaporean. Because that's what I define myself by. I don't care if my great-grandparents came from China, **I'm** Singaporean and that's all that matters as far as I'm concerned. 

But this competitiveness we got from the Chinese, who told us that good grades and education were all that ever mattered in life, is what's fundamentally wrong with our society, I think. It's that mentality that we need to be better than everyone else, that idea that we have to trample over them all. It's what convinces parents to throw thousands of dollars into after-school tuition for their children that, very often, is absolutely useless because their children's poor grades are not caused by any problems a tutor could fix. It's what torments children so badly that they wind up throwing themselves off buildings. 

And yet, we won't do anything about it, because it ""mostly works"", I guess. I just wonder how many more people need to die before we'll finally wake up and acknowledge the problems, let alone do anything to fix them.. r/unpopularopinion but you have a point

*a lot actually*. I am sorry to say but I haven't faced so much racism in my life as I have here in Singapore. I just can't wait to get out. I don't want to generalize this but maybe I am unfortunate but I haven't meet a single person here who treats me/ us like a human being.. To be fair to Singaporeans, competition is ingrained in culture. You‚Äôre surrounded by two large countries with different religious ideologies, and you lack resources other than your own human capital. 

Competitiveness and individual excellence  is what has made you succeed so far. Whether it is the right values for the future who knows? But that‚Äôs been the case for at least for the last 50 years. 

Embrace it - but with an understanding that working together with people gets you further eventually than prioritizing yourself only :) that‚Äôs the big lessons SG peeps need to know long run. Some of them is definitely agreed, but rushing for mrt seat and overtaking when not late, is rather justifiable. 

MRT seat is good to have tbh if you are taking long trips and sometimes other people can get fast enough that you do not have seats , even more so when you are in a group

Late is rather..... relative. Late for work does not mean you need to literally be late for work, the same goes for school. People may have plans on things to do early on etc, so it's good to not judge on that basis.. Like 90% of what you listed is the same in other major western cities.. Don't even get me started on elders and teens alike choping seats with books or laptops in libraries.. we taking meritocracy to a whole new level.. Kiasu on steroids. That ego is being bolstered because since young we're always being told how our country is superior to the every other country around us. For example, I have friends who do nothing with their lives, but because they are lucky enough to be born as singaporeans, they have the gall to say hateful things and look down on certain groups of less privileged foreigners.. Ego is a mental self defense mechanism. The lesser your self esteem, the bigger the ego.

Caused by toxic parenting. Parents who expect alot and keep telling you that you are not good enough.. A friend of mine once postulated that the high ego in guys is contributed by NS. She studied and lived in Australia for a short period and notice Singapore guys are alot more cocky and egoistic than others. And rarely when she met a guy from Singapore that is less misogynistic, it appears that he somehow has some condition that 'exempts' him from the usual NS.. People travel to see the world, to experience different cultures, climates, environment....


Singaporeans travel to escape.. Bucket list is great for consolidating all your to-dos. But I don't understand the need for some to showcase what they have done on their bucket list, and ironically, it becomes a competition on social media to see who has 'completed more'. > Personally, I‚Äôve hardly come across Singaporeans who could appreciate the journey, rather than obsessing with the goal. Even those who think they appreciate the journey has the goal in mind, and the goal is still shaped by some kind of competitiveness.

""Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."". >  Most tellingly, notice how many tend to describe their travels with ‚Äúit has the best ______‚Äù.

Actually, I don't really get what you mean by this. Any examples?. Somehow, children must aspire to be doktor, lolyer, banker or biznusman.

God forbid if you aspire to be a writer or chef

Happy cake day. The lack of social safety net leads to such behavior.. Like how every country speak their own English with their own accents and local slang, but only Singapore proudly claim it to be singlish. No other country made their own derivation of English official, except America.. :(. Ah fellow EDMWer. Good to see you.. I do my thing. But I do wonder why they have to bring their competitiveness to their personal lives. After all, people should 'slow down' after work. Agree with your thoughts. That's where you sometimes hear people refer to us as ""1st world country, 3rd world manners"" (or variations of the phrase)

As a country, we simply grew and tasted success too fast for our own personal development to catch up.. People here don't enjoy the journey, they just want the title. Hence, you have doctors, lawyers or bankers who hate their jobs but still stay at it because they want $$$ and bragging rights. Income inequality also. If you arent the top few, you get an unfairly miserable paycheck for first world standards. This is the fault of the PAP for refusing to draw a poverty line and introduce a minimum wage and fairer wealth distribution. Sg has the lowest proportion of gdp going to wages among developed countries.. ""I am happy with a 2k job, not planning to have kids, love public transport and I am an indoor kind of guy.""

I swear to fucking god everybody I told that to gives me that reaction like you said.. In some circles of people I know they call it peasantry. Pretty sad tbh. YES. Many don't get it. I'm doing a degree, majoring in two supposedly useless subjects. But I enjoy it. So so much. I know that I'm not graduating with something in banking which should guarantee me expensive bags and big houses and stuff but I'd rather enjoy the journey with a decent salary that'll get me by in the field I love working in. I feel I don't NEED these stuff (well if I can have them then that's great but it's not necessary) and idk, I feel some people think I am unmotivated. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. > here's an exercise: tell others that you truly are happy just being and having what you have. That you have enough and don't desire further luxuries in life. Note their responses.

That's quite a common sentiment around my friends imo... A few even say they want to cut back their careers and take pay cuts so they can have more time.. Thanks, I made that statement because I don't wish to be misunderstood as attacking my country. I love my country, but damn, people should learn to slow down and stop being competitive in interactions and on the road. Agree. At times, they will put you down subtly just to one-up over you in front of others. > how few locals have the drive to learn to code, learn to cad or learn some subject so that they develop a mastery and deep expert expertise etc. Then they wonder why their career become chui

Very much so. I've mentioned it multiple times in this sub in the past, but I'll mention it again: it fucking drives me up the wall to see the people here still think and behave like they're #1 with nothing new to learn, then wonder why their competitors are taking a shit on them every day.. This is very true but not unique to $ingapore, I think one of the key things here is an expectation that education stops at college/university and postgraduate education, such as MBA, is not about learning, but about status. 

Newer generations seem to be improving on this aspect I believe, but often lack social skills, as they have limited exposure to real world situations. 

I think the government realises both issues. There's a hint of truth in that I think... I heard/read a lot more complaint regarding competitive behaviours from Singaporeans than experiencing them myself. The ego explanation of the top comment answers this too. Like to compete, but don't like to be lose, don't like to be proven wrong.. of course the idea was Singapore as a nation needing to compete against other nations, not every individual Singaporean, but people are fucking each other up to get ahead anyway, even without the government announcing anything.

like they always say, sinkie must pwn sinkie. That is a good mindset for work, because the working world is harsh. But my grouse is that Singaporeans must also carry this mindset outside of work, which actually makes society less tolerable. Can you provide the quote for that? I would love to read. Can't speak for Koreans, but having lived in Tokyo, I can use the Japanese as an example.

In work and school, Japanese are extremely competitive, even more so than Singapore.

But on the road and commuting in the train, while it is fast-paced and sardine-packed, graciousness is still being practised and on the roads, people will still give way to those who need to switch lane to make a turn. Exactly. It is very unhealthy. It is no coincidence that mental issues are plaguing the youth nowadays. He was high when he said that! You could be second, third or fourth.. hell you could even be fifth!. If you‚Äôre not the best, then you‚Äôre just one of the rest.... God forbids someone to chase his/her dream, instead of doing a job that earn $$$ and bragging rights. what an assessment. I find myself like that sometimes too, and I really regret it. It was my parents doing the one-upping from when I was young though... (and funny enough they are Malaysians from a very humble and poor family background)

I guess, many SG kids like myself got sucked into this competitiveness because our parent's generation has experienced how the lack of education really takes away opportunities. Hence the ""you must become doctor/lawyer/banker"" mentality?. Follow Malaysian here. Am a PR. I really don‚Äôt like living here ahah. How are you doing now in Malaysia? I‚Äôm still studying as of now so I‚Äôm still considering if I should go back when I graduate... I'm chinese and i' m lazy af. True, maybe Taiwan is still slightly better, not counting Taipei. Taiwanese are not so aggro in general when you speak to them and people there tend to be more considerate.. > It's just in the genes to be competitive in everything

It's less nature, and more nurture. The cultural and economic environment you grow up in is what determines your competitiveness. When folks say things like ""competitiveness is a Chinese thing la"", the word ""Chinese"" is used as its cultural definition, not genetic.

Genetics as an explanation for *all* behaviors harks back to a time when societies had a limited understanding of what influences our lives... a time when our family and immediate social groups within a 10km radius defined 99% of who we are. Globalization the internet has changed all that. Let's move past lazy narratives like ""it's in the genes"".

>It's just in the genes to be competitive in everything.

I'm Indian, from India, and I hear the same thing as a commentary on how competitive things are in Indian society.. I'm not OP, but

>examples? like pple suddenly quoting their life story / academics to prove a point? yeah i can see it in this sub but i dont think they are being competitive, just poor comm skills

Yeah. Singaporeans have nothing much to talk about. You definitely have heard of girls complaining about guys always talking about NS or work. Yeap. I don't know why people have so much trouble finding better topics to talk about at parties.

>this is your assumption. weddings usually only happen once and involves many friends. dont see anything wrong in sharing

It's fine, but he might be referring to the all the drama surrounding weddings. People get upset about who gets married first, who's wedding is more flamboyant, and there's a lot of shit stirring, salt and grudges. It's actually really common, but hidden and people don't talk about it because of how sensitive it is. You won't know  unless you dig deep.

>this is just poor social etiquette. dont think there is a competition here

Rare but a few people do compete on public transport.. [deleted]. Yep, I'm an Indonesian PR and every examples OP listed can be easily applied to many Indonesians... Indonesians are just a bit more relaxed in the corporate settings, but much, much more hierarchical at the same time.. This mentality also manifests in other asian cultures, not just the Chinese. As much as you dislike, being culturally chinese is not something you can ignored, even after 2-3 gens have passed.. More accurate to blame Confucianism than strictly Chinese culture. Japanese and South Korean are also known for being competitive and putting education and work first above everything else. The big difference is they are more allowed to pursue their creativity dreams. Vietnam is also the same from what my Viet friends have told me, but they're not really known for being that in the world because they're not as influential as the other mentioned Asian countries. [removed]. I won't say I am an avid traveller, but I have travelled to a few countries in SEA, US and Europe, taking their buses and Singapore has the most entitled passenger of all. Only in Singapore, people can refuse to scoot to the inner seat, and when you attempt to sit there, they will glare at you like you owe them your first born. Plus those that place their bags on the chair despite the bus being crowded. It happens so often here and these people don't even feel bad. Even apparent in Starbucks. Oftentimes people who engage in behaviour like that are doing so to make themselves feel better about their own shortcomings and unhappiness. At least in my experience. 

The successful, happy people I know don't have a bad word to say about anyone. The people I know who are struggling in some aspect of life or are unhappy about their lot, they have a lot to say about everyone.. This may just explain alot. Especially amongst Asian countries. I think most other countries in Asia will look up towards other better developed countries, like the US, UK, or even Japan. They will have comments telling the people to look towards those other countries in developing a culture for success. Like simulating the civic mindedness of Japan and the education system of Sweden. But in Singapore, we usually just look at the negatives of other countries with the gov here always stating how lucky we are.. I feel strongly about this too. That's because of how the newspaper always trumpet headlines about good things about Singapore, never the bad things. People just read headlines, grew up with inordinate sense of well being. 

I realized that Singapore sucks at many things. My bullshit alarm goes off when govt. said that we can be hub of this and that. Come on.. how many talents do we have. 

Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam have so much more talents.. Vietnamese student here. Was once told by a guy that foreigners in SG contribute nothing but troubles. When I asked him what kind of troubles, he cannot answer, just ramble on like ""social la, jobs, overcrowding la..."" Dude has been pounded into his head that foreigners = trouble. You put it perfectly. i was sent to study in singapore from a young age and used to make the daily commute from JB to singapore every single day. i had sg classmates who would ask me whether my family was poor / whether i lived in a kampung / why was my english so good lol / why is malaysia so dirty and poor. 

on a nicer note, my sg friends' parents tend to have a better impression of me when i reveal that i'm malaysian - ""wah malaysian means hardworking!"" ""malaysian girls are humble!"" etc.. It's different for everyone i guess. When I came out from tekong, I was embarrassed to even talk to my mom because we were treated as the lowest lifeform inside BMT. My pride and existence have been entirely erased I feel. However I see section mates talking to their girlfriend right after bookout like they just came back from a boy scouts camp lol.


I do realise sometimes officers feel entitled even after they ORD, like they are a special breed of humans or something.. I believe it is more of a coincidence in your friend's case. From my experience, NS has a more humbling effect if anything. Maybe your friend studied with all the white horses.. I feel the same way. A surefire way for me to know a guy hasn't achieved much between now and his ORD date, is that he still talks loudly about his NS days. Even as a guy myself, it has me shaking my head and smiling.. This is true. But I think traveling to escape shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. You can both escape and also experience different cultures. i think many travel because it's a bucket list thing. i never understood many of my friends who travel with a checkbox itinerary with the main goal of posting their travels on social media. so back to OP's qn, it really is about seeking external validation because inside, most of us are just empty.. Think maybe hes describing the instances where people say things like ‚Äúhave you ever been to Austria? It has the best snow alps‚Äù etc

Usually associating something (in this case a travel destination) with something its uniquely the best at/ for.. I must say this only applies to those who habitually compare or showcase, rather than using ‚Äúbest‚Äù for exaggerated effect.

Best [insert food here] because it is made in [insert country here]? Why the need to qualify it via some ranking?. God forbid if one wanna be in a industry where there isn‚Äôt a singular ‚Äúmodel answer‚Äù, e.g. more than one solid way to cook a dish, way more than a few good book titles around.... hey, it's cake day! thanks. Imagine their faces when you tell them if you wanna be an artist or musician in Singapore.

""Eh that industry earn not much leh""

Well sir, just because an industry doesn't earn you much income does not mean suddenly it's not viable. I swear people here live just to work like robots. 

There is no creativity here just a bunch of robots following the system and not thinking for themselves.. So y u hab to spin a gud stoly to lai into getting top courses. Must disagree a bit here. Singlish grammar can be way different from standard English. It's like English words with Malay/Chinese grammar. In this case though not a language, it should be classed as a patois. U fookin wot m8







The first two developed alongside Modern English, while most creole languages (including Singlish) branched off Modern English during the colonial era. They're all recognised by linguists, and like Singlish feature non-standard pronunciations, grammar, and vocabulary.. Malaysian English is called Manglish, but it's definitely a lot less in the spotlight than Singlish is!. Some people just live on pwning other people.. 3rd world attitude I think. Manner wise, Singaporean more of ‚Äò fake it till you make it ‚Äò. We shake hand because we feel like it‚Äôs a need. We wear a facade while meeting people. To the point you can‚Äôt differentiate genuine manner and fake manner. Then when we go other country and bring the same manners, they see right through us. Then we come back and say ‚Äò X country citizens are trash because ....‚Äô

Attitude wise, it‚Äôs very old fashion but with current technology, doesn‚Äôt balance. Can‚Äôt give you example, I‚Äôm a cave man. üòÇ. Agree. Other country they enjoy that profession or simply just want to do good. (Bill gates and his wife) but of course cannot take him for comparison. But u get the gist. 

Country too fast. But the people cannot catch up. We might still be in the 80s attitude. But also cannot blame LKY. Back then he had to take charge and quickly solve 200 things in one night ( example only not real ). And then it snowballs to our current gen. True but sometimes I think we need to stand in the government shoes too. Imagine having a min wage , let‚Äôs say $7 per hour. And it‚Äôs across anyone who works in Singapore,PR, FT, FW. We will not have as much entrepreneur, because let‚Äôs be honest. Starting a company anywhere in the world is not easy feet (coming from experience, ex ID company). And Singapore has no natural resources, meaning we are solely growing because of ‚Äòcheap labour‚Äô , good ideas and accessibility to other SEA country. 

And I think, I emphasise THINK , they want to encourage more ‚Äòthe more you work the more you earn‚Äô attitude. If today Singapore has a minimal wage of $7, everyone will just work at the easiest, nearest workplace(eg, McDonald‚Äôs, not saying it‚Äôs bad but it is what it is. Accept it) and we won‚Äôt have a lot of competition, that‚Äôs great right? But think about the amount of ideas and creativitness( new word I think u get it ?) that are lost, especially where we at the the stage of ‚Äòyoung people is the future‚Äô 

So in my point of view, I agree some industry(don‚Äôt talk about NS) wage is too Low, especially when you‚Äôre Singaporean. But it still boils down to our lifestyle, whether you choose to live lavishly , comfortably or savvy is a different story. Most Singaporean wants to live life comfortably and lavishly (sometimes). We tend to look down on others that aren‚Äôt making as much as we are, and then want to live a life beyond our capability , end up tons of debt then blame government for not doing this and that. 

But. But. But. I believe there‚Äôs something that needs to be done to our housing prices. Maybe working hours need a change too

TLDR : yes wages is an issue, but in government view, it seems like a ‚Äòthe more you work the more you earn‚Äô move. To me housing is a bigger issue, maybe even working hours.

I‚Äôm not the government Nor do I work there, just my view. Also only have O levels so don‚Äôt judge if I said something wrong. Instead correct my mistakes. Cheers.. Let me add to that list: 

Rushing to get on the escalator before someone else then proceed to stand on the left side anyway 

Rushing/sometimes running to get into a queue even when they see someone clearly approaching the queue first 

Rush to tap their ezlinks first at bus/mrt gantries 

Force their way to board buses even when there‚Äôs a tight squeeze to enter the bus 

... 

... etc

Maybe it‚Äôs in (some) of our nature to make sure we don‚Äôt ‚Äúlose out‚Äù in every/any way possible. We‚Äôve been brought up in a ‚ÄúSg‚Äôs the best; first world country; world-class standards; #1 in everything‚Äù society so we feel entitled and think we always always always only deserve first place because we‚Äôre obviously better than the entire universe. Giving way to someone else as a form of basic human decency and graciousness? No way, what the hell, you think you‚Äôre better than me? Oof.. "" then wonder why their competitors are taking a shit on them every day. ""   


AHHHH! The Gahmen bring in too many CECA!!!!! If Gahmen don't protect me from competition, I go on EDMW, call all Indian people rapists and indulge my violent incel fantasies about murdering them and their families.  Maybe after I post all these racist things about other people and call them rapists, we all together go create some telegram group where we...  


Do I have the impression about right?. Agree. We are no where near western levels of competitiveness. When I was in US, there was much more male posturing and aggression between men. 

In SG, the level of male aggression and competition is toned down a lot, which is a huge relief to me.. Can you blame them though? There's a real steep cost to not getting ahead.. Can sleep soundly at night.... There are some character traits that can't be switched on and off at will..  Sounds like Singaporeans are in need of help, to be more gracious and less competitive, when there's no need for it.... Truly exquisite. I am not sure but I think one upping comes from a lack of self esteem. That's why you need to one up each other. If you are confident and content, you don't need to engage with one upping.

Also noticed that people who engage in one upping come from middle class and are trying to make it look like they are better off like upper middle class and above. I met some people from the upper classes who are rich af and they keep such a low profile that you mistake them for normal everyday people.

Just people I guess.. I would say give yourself some time to evaluate. I worked in Singapore for 3.5 years after graduation. 

I took the time to weight the pros and cons carefully. Singapore is a great place to save due to low cost of living, low inflation rate. You don't need a car, can rent a room for 500 $, cost of stuff is actually very low ($3 to 4 per meal at food court compared to RM 6 to 7++ in Malaysia).

I also had nothing holding me back in Singapore and a family business to run in Malaysia. So for me, there was no real reason to stay in Singapore.. An outlier then. Lol I didn't say all chinese is competitive, just that most Chinese do. Besides, lavish weddings, one upping relatives, cutting lanes, all of this is commom encounter even back in my country Indonesia. Lots of Chinese Indo threw crazy extravagant wedding, competing to show off who's the richest, especially from big cities like Jakarta and Surabaya. The other time there was a couple from Surabaya held their wedding in Bali and had Calum Scott as the guest singer. The souvenirs for guests were gold. Some other couple also had their proposal event and engagement in Macau. There was also a 17 year old girl who had pre-sweet 17 birthday party by taking her 10 best friends to France, all fees paid. Don't get me started with cutting lanes and one upping not just relatives but also strangers. My point is this is just sadly a deep rooted Chinese culture, always wanna show they're better than others.. I guess so. I do notice Singapore puts academic achievement first and foremost more than other asian countries I know (except South Korea). Figures why I don‚Äôt know what they are considering I‚Äôm still in school. thanks for explaining!. What does success and happiness mean?. Not just the gov. I hear it from my parents, my teachers and I hear it during social studies as well.. As someone from up north, I think Singaporeans tend to look down on Malaysians in general though the people i work with have been great and they even envy Malaysians. But that's just my experience with a small group. 

I'm just here to make a living like everyone else. I certainly haven't taken away jobs that might exist for a Singaporean as I'm a transfer. *shrug*

There are plenty of things to like and dislike about both countries. >look up towards other better developed countries like the US, UK

honestly in my experience sg people who 'look up' towards the US and UK are usually people who have NEVER been to the US and/or the UK, let alone experience the failings of their education system, healthcare (ogod), public sanitation... etc. also lol not sure about 'culture for success'.. > on a nicer note, my sg friends' parents tend to have a better impression of me when i reveal that i'm malaysian - ""wah malaysian means hardworking!"" ""malaysian girls are humble!"" etc.

In my experience that has been true. I've found Malaysians to be friendlier and more approachable. Also, I guess at least the ones who come to Singapore will be more hardworking.. On the other hand specs are pretty nice

But also you can't generalise. I've got a superior that boasts so much about NS and yet call it humbling. He claims that guys who goes to NS will come out more mature and humbled by what the real world can do to a person. 

So, he will often say that the girls won't understand the real world because they have never done NS. And that sg guys will always be more mature and understand the world more than other nationalities.. Good day, litpath. It's your Reddit Cake Day! üéÇüéäüéä

You're now in the Six-Year Club!

What else can you achieve in NS besides NS? And honestly you spend 2 years of your life doing a certain thing, of course you would talk about it.. Indeed.


But the fourth or fifth trip to the same place? It‚Äôs like taking a bus from downtown to the suburbs... only instead of driving, we flew.. Something like going to the Zoo, posting your pics with the animals, then coming back. When asked about the trip, they know nothing about the animals (diet, habits, name, etc), nothing about the place, nor the people there. 


(Disclaimer: this is an extreme example. Also not everyone is like that). If anything is the most ""unsolid"", it's law. Well, saying it's official is pretty harsh, but people here take it a little bit too seriously. Feels like alot of us here glorifies it too much. So, what I meant was, no other countries glorifies their dialected English as much, besides the Americans.

And there are quite a few, who prides on this patois so much they don't even accept where some of the words come from as well. Ive had friends who swears that scarly is a true blue singlish word and has nothing to do with the Malay word, 'sekali'. Similarly, the word agar-agar... Yup, compare singlish to those. That's my point, Singaporeans are being proud of singlish. Accepting it is different from glorifying it. Even the gov is discouraging it, but the people are exalting it.. Yea, but Malaysians aren't proud of it. They know they have an accent, and probably hate it when people think they are speaking singlish. I don't think they will argue that they are speaking manglish and not English when they are being corrected.. people will work at the industry they want to work at. you think anyone wants to handle hot grease and fake meat voluntarily? they'll work what they want for minimum wage. Something to think about: most countries have minimum wage including our neighbour malaysia. So are the malaysians all vying to work at the nearest macdonalds? ü§î. In my industry, we *need* foreign workers because almost no local person wants to work in hospitality. The main problem is there are management companies from Indonesia and other parts of APAC who come here and set up properties in Singapore, and are handing our asses over on a platter. There is **so fucking much** we can learn from our competitors but so few locals are willing to change their mindsets.. machismo and backstabbing are 2 diff things. No ours is just more subtle. Singaporeans do need to be more aggressive in general though.. It can be learned gradually. The Germans are serious at work but after work, they enjoy their lives. Too bad they are still focusing on the old industries that make Singapore successful today. The new internet economy is not a zero sum game.. Over here, the government is literally screaming in our faces to be gracious and considerate. Like those cartoon characters on the MRT or emotional short videos telling you to give up your seat / appreciate others. Or signs everywhere that tell you not to litter.. >Also noticed that people who engage in one upping come from middle class and are trying to make it look like they are better off like upper middle class and above. I met some people from the upper classes who are rich af and they keep such a low profile that you mistake them for normal everyday people.

ikr, relevant quote,  

""We buy things we don't need with money we don't have to impress people we don't like."". Well, I think that's subjective.. I envy Malaysians because you guys are happier even if not as well off as Singaporeans. Can easily see the difference between the Singaporean side of my family and the Malaysian side.. There it is. My point exactly. Some people pick the good points of other countries and talk about it. I go there and at least I see at least common courtesy in buses at least to sit in the inner seat. Travelling there, there are always someone asking what I'm looking for whenever I look lost. In Japan, their civic mindedness is off the charts. 

But people here, exhibit A, you, only look at the bad. And I feel like that's the way the government is leading us right now. They are doing a good job at it, I won't disagree with that. But my point here is to address the original comment that states how high the ego of Singaporeans are.

So, like you said, whenever someone comes to you and say things like, wow, Scotland is such a wonderful place, the people are nice, so carefree, wish I could go there. And people like yourself will retort with things like, you've never been there, the people aren't educated, their infrastructure is terrible, youve never seen the world yet. 

See where in getting at about high ego and being stuck up?. Wow seriously? That koolaid in SAF worked well for him huh.. Lol that is wrong on so many levels. I think he just hates women. And despite NS, I disagree our boys are more mature than other nationalities, mainly because our lives are so sheltered. The sheltered lives we live is a whole other topic.. I'd sorta agree that everyone comes out of NS a **little** bit more mature (but humbled not so sure...).

But outside of NS, the bad habits can also come back.. Gee thanks!. Yeah because Bali and BKK are places for cheap getaways mah. People who go there may not be able to afford trips to Europe or places way more expensive.. That has nothing to do with singlish in itself. Your friends are ignorant and stupid, that‚Äôs all.. >That's my point, Singaporeans are being proud of singlish. Accepting it is different from glorifying it.

You think Scots aren't proud of speaking Scots or West Africans aren't proud of West African Pidgin? The latter even got the BBC to launch this: www.bbc.com/pidgin

Kanasai, this kind of Sinkie ah.... Does reddit have a bold text function? I think I emphasised the word ‚Äò think ‚Äò there. But then again, don‚Äôt so groggy when you wake up leh. 

So if no minimum wage you‚Äôll not work what you want? Because it seems to me that you will only work for what you want when there‚Äôs a minimum wage.. Sinkie guys also try to enjoy lives after work, but they fight over siambu

Sinkie girls try to enjoy lives after work, but fight over who‚Äôs doing what on social media. Being serious at work is not the same as ""stealing someone else's lunch"". We can be serious without living in a dog eats dog world.. How can business not be a zero sum game ?. I'm Singaporean, and I was doing a little bit of sarcastic humour with my previous comment...

Anyway the thing is, if people don't want to do it, you can shove all that good intentions you want down their throats, and it still won't make them better people.. For context I have actually lived in the UK for a number of years. My parents themselves lived in the US. I grew up in Malaysia and then Singapore. My opinions are derived from my personal experiences, having lived in a number of places. 

I don‚Äôt deny that here are certain small things I‚Äôm grateful for and appreciate during my time in the UK. But if I had to compare living in Singapore vs the UK, it‚Äôs self explanatory that I turned down job offers in the UK and chose to come back to Singapore. Given the current political situation, most of my friends who chose to stay after graduation are also making preparations to come back. 

If someone asked me hey would you go the US / the UK for a holiday? I would obviously reply yes it‚Äôs great for a tourist. I fly back almost every year myself. But my answer would be different if someone asked if I would actually want to live there in the long term. Alternatively, I would recommend Malaysia both for holidays and long term living. 

I don‚Äôt feel that this has anything to do with ego or being stuck up lol, just personal experiences.. That's one thing, but he also looks down on foreign guys who didn't go through NS, and also guys that are in the lower pes. But he is a superior, so he can say whatever he likes. Lol.. The number of Europeans I've met who are 25 and older and have no idea how to cook is scary. I don't think it's fair to make blanket statements like that.. I think what r/keyupiopi would be referring to will be going to less common places like Sabah, Hatyai etc. Same distance, same or cheaper prices, but in general Singaporeans don't like to go coz these places are not as ""well developed"". 

It really drives home the point that Singaporeans travel to escape, not to experience new places, as most would rather take a 5th trip to BKK than a first trip to Hatyai. So? At least the Scots are in the UK. And btw, this thread started about kiasuness where a trait viewed negatively by many other nations is being glorified here. And I mentioned that English is one of them. Do you think the English people who find  theScot accent endearing will think the same of singlish? I doubt even the people closer to home will find singlish endearing. But nah, it seems that quite a few here are very proud of it. So it's proving my point that this is similar to the original comment about kiasuness.. One of my dorm-mates in a UK uni didn't know how to do his laundry or iron his clothes. His mum would come over every few weeks to do it for him. Imo the superior above may not be right for every single individual, but he's certainly correct at the population level.. > Do you think the English people who find theScot accent endearing will think the same of singlish? 

They don't. The average Englishman finds both incomprehensible and grating. It's the same.

>I doubt even the people closer to home will find singlish endearing. But nah, it seems that quite a few here are very proud of it. 

I think Singlish is a beautiful language and I'm proud of it.. No I totally disagree.

The number of Europeans and Americans I know who have no idea about financial planning is pretty close to 100%. Their idea of financial planning is to get a job and hope there's a pension or financial assistance when they are older that will suffice. And I'm not talking about young people, I'm talking about people from all ages and sexes.

Compare that to Singaporean guys. A large majority are already introduced to it by the time they are in NS (thanks Aviva) or in uni (thanks annoying insurance salesperson classmates).

What's your definition of maturity here? If you're talking about life skills and ability to survive in the working world, Singaporean men are much better equipped. The majority of us had to learn how to clean maybe cook, and even drive and look after ourselves in national service or staying in dorms / boarding school.

If you're talking about emotional maturity then that's something really subjective that I wouldn't even dare make a blanket statement about. Emotional maturity is also assessed at a cultural level. If you think someone who cries over things or doesn't know how to handle a breakup is emotionally immature, then consider the other extreme where people get angry or intoxicated and start being physically violent. That's a form of immaturity too but for some reason, some cultures place less emphasis on one over the other with the excuse that 'boys will be boys'.. Case in point. Even the gov isn't proud of it, but you are. I'm not saying it's bad, but it's just proving the original comment.

Anyway, Englishmen do think every other accent is jarring. Some even claim that There's no such thing as American English, but bastardised English. But they are more welcoming to the Scots than us. In fact, quite a few Londoners have admitted to me that they can't tell the difference between our English and the heavily accented English of the mainland Chinese.. > The number of Europeans and Americans I know who have no idea about financial planning is pretty close to 100%.

Desperate for any action, why are we surprise we have horny males venturing into criminal enterprise to get the thrills they need in a wholesome relationship? 

Look at Japan and their ""chikan"" culture. If Singapore is not careful, we could become the next city to gain such notoriety.. Singapore males are heading towards the Japanese males' practices.. Wtf. Why can‚Äôt we let women live in peace? This very well could be your sister/cousin/family friend or anyone you know who became a victim of this disgusting community!! They are legitimately minding their own business and some prev think he has the right to objectify her??

Where do I sign up?. I don't understand these people...why can't they just go home and watch a porno?.  sex depraved people are in sg are fucking disgusting. The gov should make all phones camera flash and w the sound on like Korea. Just because they are in public does not mean they are for your sexual pleasure. Especially those talking about 14 and above, fucking pedophilia is everywhere yucks.

edit:those who downvoted me, can I know why you think the opposite or why you disagree?. People seems to forget tumblr exist. ladies and gentlemen we got him. Maybe the guilt got to him, and he had a change of heart. Whatever the case, it's a good thing he has exposed the group. It's always good when someone from the inside of a horrible/evil organization/group leaves and exposes them.. >According to our reader, he was pulled into the group by chance.

eh i think i know what he means. i dont use telegram much but when i opened the app recently, i was added into a soccer betting group and a russian looking group (no idea what they're talking about). it‚Äôs literally the most primal desires of men. 

Not saying this is ok, but you have to be a special kind of naive to not know about these things.. This. at least it hasnt gotten to korea level yet. the mass spy cam and leaks there are far worse. We live in a society.. we live in a society

>According to this reader, the group shares porn and photos of local women that are snapped in public, like on trains and buses.""

Tfw mothershit can just say 'tiagongs from our reader...' and then rephrase and repackage the article with a more clickbaity title.. yet singaporeans are still not heading towards japanese politeness levels. Is your GPA high enough to sign up?. True. Think of this way, We will not understand them Bcos we r not them in their perverted mind.

Dunno why u get downvoted though.. This used to be the case a while back, when cameras first started appearing on phones. Sometime around the smartphone era the shutter sound went away. 

Honestly I‚Äôd rather the sound didn‚Äôt come back. Why punish everyone for the sins of a few?. sex depraved sg boys/men are not by definition crazy. Manipulative, desperate, stingy, selfish, exploitative, disgusting, yes but not crazy for the most part. The fact that many of these men are high functioning, evasive, able to conceal their true selves and, for the most part except for a few, are able to control and stop their urges from manifesting into reality.

Look at all the physical and sexual assault and rape cases in other countries. Sg cases are relatively mild compared to them. Hence, while I didn't downvote, crazy isnt really a good description.. Does recording video in Korea have shutter and flash too? How does it work?. It is extremely easy to remove shutter sounds if you are determined enough.  End up youre just penalizing everyone for the crimes of a few, which they will still do anyway.  Wasting resources.. Shutter sound comes out of a tiny speaker, which I have found to be extremely easy to block with a finger.

There's a simple general rule: if you are visible from public space, it is legal for your picture to be taken. You can request the person taking the picture to delete it, but it is not against the law for them to not delete it.

If this is not in place, well, you have no freedom of the press. We already have tiny spy camera capable of taking pictures anytime.

Now if people find legally taken pictures of 14 years old arousing, well, that's how humans work and we need to learn how to deal with it. People jerking off to your picture is not that big of a deal. The majority of sexual abuses (that actually harm or hurt) are committed by people the victims know. Learn to prevent those instead of worrying about stupid issues.. Seems like you are out of the loop, boy.. Probably didn't get into the VVIP group. Or maybe initial wave anyhowly invite, after that became invite-only?

At least that's how I got into high-profile clans/guilds in games LMAO.

By being there when it was small and unselective.. TBH, I think the rise of all these perverts and voyeur incidents is partially because of our abstience-based sex education, conservative mindset about sex and stressful education system.

Young men have no outlet, they go online and become creepos, and this happens

Maybe we should look into why this is happening instead of saying ""Aiyo! Why men these days liddat ah? So bad ah!"". Rather take a knife in my face than having to navigate social contracts of pseudo-politeness though. No, but I am a NUS student. Is that good enough?. It is a mild inconvenience but people who do not wish for their photos to be taken without their permission will know someone took their photo. I personally don't like the sound but I rather everyone have the camera shutter so we know if someone took our photos.. thank you for the explanation. Perharps I used the wrong word, disgusting might be a more approriate word here. Even though sg has few sexual related crimes compared to other countries, reducing it should still be the important goal. The national anthem starts playing at max volume when you start the recording.  in Korea, it is illegal for phones to silence the camera shutter.  Since Korea has many voyeurism soy camera issues, they implemented this law to try to reduce the problem.
[Article on spy cams]( Got ""ploin!"" sound when u press record if u know what i mean.. i know exactly what i am talking about. You're my direct opposite, I enter well known clans/guilds when they are dying then leave because they are dead.. If Japan is anything to go by, being socially awkward, single and sexually repressed is the perfect recipe for producing a pervert.

I think it's a cop out to say that these men have no outlet however, they make a conscious choice as to what kind of porn they watch.. As a student I disagree that we have an abstinence based sex education. Speaking from personal experience we were definitely taught about birth control and contraceptives as well as the dangers of STDs. Could just be my school but the only abstinence bias they had was telling us that statistically abstinence is the only 100 percent success contraceptive. Doesnt seem too biased or conservative IMO.. Go ahead.. I didn‚Äôt know this, that‚Äôs kinda amusing.
Can tourists snap without sound on?. That‚Äôs clearly not my question. I can understand shutter and flash when taking a picture, but how does it work when you are taking a video?. Tumblr exist?. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). I mean, even with Japan being the example, they're more open in certain views regarding sex and sexuality.

I mean, a pretty popular example would be their R18 videos industry, and how their talents can transition to and from other entertainment fields even after starring in R18 videos. (Ex-singer becoming AV casts, AV casts becoming actress/presenters.. etc)

For them if they want to see nekkid Japanese grils they can just buy a disc on Amazon.jp, but uhh... maybe that's why guys here take the risk to be creeps for just clothed photos in public lmao..

Mandalay Beer, a fraught business operation, was the only option for drinkers until 1995 when Asia Pacific Breweries entered the market and started producing Myanmar Beer and Tiger Beer in a joint venture with the military government.

> But with founding partner Maung Zaw as the operation‚Äôs chief brewer, slowly Burbrit Brewery started to take shape and win over a brand new market. After opening the brewery in January, 2017, now their operation and its associated Taproom in downtown Yangon - which started a year later - is a successful and growing business.

> The Taproom has a familiar vibe to the Singaporean establishment that inspired it, with open spaces, wooden furniture and a relaxed drinking hall atmosphere.

> Burbrit currently has more than a dozen beer varieties available, including four packaged in cans for retail sale in local supermarkets and hotels. The labels include locally-themed names like ‚ÄòRangoon Blonde‚Äô, a German-style lager, Burma Pale Ale, a fuller-bodied IPA and Nagani, a now award winning bright red beer brewed with dragon fruit and mint.

> Like their craft beer counterparts in Thailand, the company is increasing its focus on unique, local ingredients. Maung Zaw says the brewing process has become more consistent and drinkers - mostly affluent and urban - are starting to appreciate the flavours.

106,Schools for design degree,dk41ef,2019-10-19 13:52:21,"
Hey guys! I‚Äôm hoping someone would shed some lights on this problem I‚Äôm having. I‚Äôm a design student and I‚Äôm planning to take degree right after my diploma (because I know my lazy ass will be too lazy to take it if I go out work first + plus it makes my mum happy so)

I‚Äôm studying visual communication.

So far, I‚Äôm looking at NAFA, Lasalle and SIM.

NAFA and SIM offers top up degree. (One year only)
School fees are similar (22k +, not including overseas study programme)
NAFA is affiliated to University of Central Lancashire, UK. (Which I honestly have not heard of)
SIM is affiliated to RMIT Australia.

Lasalle is 3 years. If my portfolio is good enough my diploma studies are relevant, I can be exempted from year 1 so thus 2 years.
School fees is $9730 per annum.
I‚Äôve heard from my friends at Lasalle that the overseas programs are only for selected students.

Last but not least, NTU ADM. I‚Äôm not that confident that I‚Äôll get in, plus it‚Äôs 3-4 years :(

I know when it comes to the design industry, it‚Äôs skills > qualifications. But since I‚Äôll be spending my money and time doing degree, I might as well choose as good school.
I‚Äôm still my doing research on my own, but would be great if someone who went to any of these schools give some advices or what is the studies like there.

Thank you!",6,0.64,2.0,"You might want to consider SIT glasgow school of art as well. It‚Äôs a 2 year degree course and if i‚Äôm not wrong there is an overseas study trip to the actual glasgow school of art in europe that is mandatory for all students to do as part of curriculum. The standard of work that comes out from GSA is good as well.. Have you heard of Raffles Design Institute? Now I think they're affiliated with Conventry University UK. They used to affiliate with University of Chester UK but not anymore. They also have top up degree program, so only continue 1 year to get bachelor degree. One thing is I almost never encounter any Singaporeans in Raffles lol. Most of their students are international students and I don't know much about the VC cause I majored in Fashion Design there. But from what I heard, it seems that NAFA is still the best choice for VC. You can try research on it first since I probably didn't help you a lot with this information üòÖ sorry",177.0,4,230,1

It may have changed in recent years, but the last I read about it, we are 3rd in Asia in terms of arms export, behind only China and South Korea; and 20th in the world, which is bonkers considering our country's size. We export as far to Europe and Africa.. Doing UO with this sucks.. OMG.. SAW! Current SAF still use this? 
Saw gunners Fire!!! IA IA IA.... As always, have a nice day.  I believe fpsrussia has a video on the ultimax which demonstrated how effective the recoil system was, by firing it single handed, on full auto and the firearm not kicking like a mule.. Doing it with any of the alternatives would be worse.--All of which are longer and heavier.  


Of course, this should not be construed as advice to 'suck it up'. Getting better gear is a process of constant improvement.

&#x200B;

My second least favorite thing about it is how firing the cheap SAF underpowered blanks turns this into a bolt action gun.  


My least favorite thing is how they ruined all the M-16 magazines in order to make them fit this gun. The M16 is sensitive to feed angles from the mag. By drilling those 2 hole to make this fit the Ultimax, they created a lot of reliability problems for the M-16 that would not have existed otherwise.. No more liao. Last ict I went back got no more saw gunner. Cssb battalion.. Too bad he can't legally own guns anymore iirc due to drug charges.. Wonder if you could drill 2 holes in a Magpul P-mag and have it work better than the standard STANAG mags on both platforms..... TBF M16 is a really shitty gun from a magazine loading perspective. 

It gets jammed easily at the slightest and was a huge pain point for marines in Vietnam.. Weren‚Äôt there rumours about him killing a guy too. The P-mag would be stiffer because of the thicker polymer walls. But I think the holes are very close to the feed lips and there is a risk of cracking under stress. The aluminium mags respond to this by bending and distorting the feed lips causing malfunctions. 

It just isn't a great design. They should have simply re-used the M-16 magazine well.. Actually, that is more complicated than that. I owned several AR-15s in the US. They were incredibly reliable. I have fired thousands of rounds through them and have never encountered an IA or jam. The design has come a very long way since Vietnam. There is a reason, lots of countries still use it. In the UK and Australia, Their special forces use the M16 derivatives even though the rest of the army uses different rifle model. The M-16 is reliable, (very) accurate, light and flexible. None of this would be true if it was a 'shitty gun that jammed easily at the slightest'. 

OTOH, I have never fired an entire magazine from one of our SAF M16 without an IA. IMO, the first part of the problem is our blanks. They don't seal well and don't provide enough power to cycle the action. The second problem is our butchered magazines. The third part of the problem is that the M16 S1 is basically a vietnam war era design that lacks basically any of the improvements that have gone into the AR-15/M16 over the decades.--Things like the Anti-bounce recoil buffer and so on. There may well be other problems invisible to us in the manufacture of these rifles. 

As for the experience in Vietnam, most of the problems stemmed from soldiers getting told that the rifle did not need cleaning, but even worse, the Army did not follow engineering instructions from colt/Armalite and used an untested of propellant ( a mixed ball propellant) that fouled up the rifle and generated high pressures in the gas system. To illustrate how significant this was, the rate of fire of the M16 a1 was rated as 800rpm. Thanks to this powder, the rate of fire on these guns increased to 1000 rpm. Also, the original M-16 did not have a chrome plated chamber. 

-This made the chamber very 'sticky' and prone to corrosion. This created a a lot of failures to extract and torn cartridge rims when coupled with the high pressures in the gas system.

-The higher rate of fire created parts breakages. 

 This was later fixed with improvements to the rifle. Barrels were chromed. The weight of the bolt carrier was increases to reduce the ROF.  Parts were strengthened and given improved anti corrosion finishes. etc etc Some these changes, like the Chromed barrel lining found their way to the M16s1 we used. 

It is worth pointing out that the problems we faced with these rifles were very different to the problems the US army faced in vietnam. Our problems tend to be along the lines of failure to feed, double feeding etc. All of these problems are magazine and feed angle related. 

( also note, the US army, not their marines were the ones that were issued the M16 first and experiences these problems)

The AR-15 rifles I owned were very insensitive to ammunition type.

If you are curious and want to know more in greater depth, this is an excellent video. 

 Correction, OUR clones are. But they're based on the 16A1. It's 40+ years old and the reason why we use it is because we can't export it anyway. But still, that's about 20+ years before we even considered replacing it.. m16 > sar21

they know it which is why theyre killing it for the br18. That would mean that the design of the ultimax drum mags would have to be significantly different, probably closer to the C-mags and we all know how ""reliable‚Äù those are....


Person I prefer the Lancer L5-AWM.. My range results say otherwise.. It is interesting that you bring up the beta C mag.  Did you know it was actually  designed  by jim Sullivan,  same guy that designed the ultimax? It is actually  a follow-up design to the ultimax drum. Also from the MK5 onwards, the Ultimax uses stanag mags and usus a common magazine well with the M-16. ST is now selling these versions of the Ultimax with the Beta C mag as the 100 rd drum option. I think that this is at least  a better idea than punching holes in magazines. 

Drum mags in general are vulnerable to dust and fine dirt. Is the C-mag actually less reliable than the original 100rd ultimax drum? It is probably hard to say without so. Some side by side engineering trial.I own a C-Mag and it was flawlessly reliable in my use.  Reliability trials by the us army done in 2008 indicate the same. But I am not a soldier in dusty Afghanistan trying to use them in 2003 to protect convoys..... lol you must be a l33t csgo player then. That's a nice tidbit of info. I do stay away from them because they make the gun heavy and harder to handle, plus the couple I tried from my buddies weren't too reliable. Perhaps they have made improvements since.. How is that even related to CSGO, does CSGO even have SAR21? 

The scope of SAR21 really helps a lot, to the effect that combat shoot my NS unit can get 100% marksmen vs NSF era when marksmen is less than 50% 

Especially night shoot I don‚Äôt even know wtf I was shooting when using M16 with the iron sights totally useless.. so badass. So lame",1282.0,33,1,1
108,TPG telco?,dk3i1i,2019-10-19 13:04:21,Anyone currently using their $0 plan? How is it so far?,4,0.6,16.0,"Great as second sim. It's basically free unlimited data and you even get roaming data in malaysia. Just switch to your primary sim when connection is unreliable.

It doesn't happen very often but when singtel is down, I can still get data from TPG so I'm always connected.. Great when it's free but if I had to pay for it I would reconsider as once you're out of TPG 4G reception (e.g. in some mrt tunnels) you would lose cell service. That and combined with their relatively slow speed compared to the other telcos makes it more useful if you have a low data cap on your main phone line but you shouldn't make it your main line. Just enjoy and cancel after the 12 months :). Good for extra data. No coverage when underground though.. Burns through my battery pretty quickly tbh not sure about others. i use it as my primary sim. it works fine but i can‚Äôt get data underground neither can i call or receive calls. Slow as hell bro. I use GOMO for my primary when im surfing the net like facebook etc. But when it comes to NETFLIX when im outside I just use TPG. Good for an extra 2 gig of data, after which the speed drops drastically.. Check for phone compatibility should be your first step.

For brands like xiaomi which aren't included, disabling the carrier check with a dialer code (Google it) will work.

Edit: If your lte enabled phone is not compatible you can only make calls through whatsapp or similar platforms.

It's free. Has free roaming to Malaysia (and Indonesia batam?) I believe it's openly stated underground reception is not supported, might be my imagination. But all in all, nothing noteworthy to scream about in terms of inconveniences.. It is stressful because customers are worried about how to finish free unlimited data. The stress doubled when they applied for 2 SIMs. Sigh...you can identified these customers as their hairs have turned from black to white.. If it actually cost money. Let's say $18 for the sake of argument, would you continue keeping it as a back up?

Secondly you're only ""protected"" against an outage on the mobile infra. As we've seen before a severe outage on singtel fibre can cause all telcos to be out. If your phone isn't LTE enabled you can't even connect and use data. TPG is LTE only.. Netflix 4k ""Am I A Joke To You?"". No, I won't keep it if they charge even $1/month. If all telcos happen to be down at the same time, there's nothing else I could have done anyway. A second sim is just meant to protect me from temporary connectivity problems.. Even if your phone is lte enabled like my backup xiaomi phone, you can't make or receive calls until you input the dialer code.

You can only use data.

Alright I see what you mean, I got my 3rd Para wrong.. I think I get what you mean. You're referring to VoLTE right?. Yeah",500.0,2,11,1

Hmmmmmm. Now know how to cry Liao ah? I thought very sa ki that night like the movie Young and Dangerous? Pui. this was outright murder... among the 3 remaining really need to have at least 1 (knife user) kena the murder charge. if not like no law and order anymore.. > # Orchard Towers brawl: Tears as woman gets murder charge reduced

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî More than three months after she was charged with murder in relation to the high-profile Orchard Towers brawl in July, Natalie Siow Yu Zhen found out on Friday (Oct 18) that she will no longer face the death penalty.

> The 23-year-old ‚Äî the only woman among seven who¬†on July 4¬†were charged with the murder of 31-year-old Satheesh Noel Gobidass ‚Äî had her charge reduced to one of voluntarily causing hurt.

> If convicted, Siow faces a maximum sentence of two years in jail and a S$5,000 fine.

> It was an unexpected turn of events for Siow, who did not know why she was called back to court on Friday. She burst into tears upon finding out that she no longer faces the gallows shortly before the court session began at 2.30pm.

> ‚ÄúBefore the judge came out, she was wondering what she was doing in court. She had no idea what was going on,‚Äù her lawyer, Mr Amarick Gill of Amarick Gill LLC, told TODAY.

> Mr Gill said that it had been two months since he told her that she should more appropriately be charged with voluntarily causing hurt and that he and his assistant, Ms Cheryl Ng of Intelleigen Legal, would make representations for that. They were back in court on Friday as the prosecution acceded to the request, he said.

> Her amended charge now states that she had kicked and punched the victim together with Tan Sen Yang, 28, Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 26, and Ang Da Yuan, 26 ‚Äî the trio still face the murder charge.

> Siow was offered bail of S$15,000.

> She walked out of the State Court at about 6pm with her father and a family friend.

> Her case will be mentioned again on Oct 25.

> THE INCIDENT

> The Orchard Towers incident that shook the nation unfolded in the early hours of July 2, when a man was found lying motionless in a pool of blood at the entrance of Orchard Towers.

> A video footage of the incident later went viral on social media, showing a man collapsing near an escalator in the building after a brawl, prompting onlookers to rush forward to check on him. The victim died in Tan Tock Seng Hospital about an hour later.

> The police established the identities of eight suspects ‚Äî two among them are women ‚Äî and arrested them within 12 hours.

> Of the eight, seven were charged on July 4. Apart from Siow, Tan Sen Yang, Joel Tan Yun Sheng and Ang, the others charged were Tan Hong Sheng, 22; Loo Boon Chong, 25; and Chan Jia Xing, 26.

> On July 11, Tan Hong Sheng, Loo and Chan had their murder charges reduced to that of consorting with Tan Sen Yang who is said to have had a foldable ‚ÄúKerambit‚Äù knife at about 5.45am on July 2 at Naughty Girl Club in Orchard Towers. The knife was allegedly used in the attack.

> Loo and Chan are currently out on bail, while Tan Hong Sheng, who was originally on bail, has been in custody since Sept 27 after jumping bail on Aug 29 when he failed to attend his hearing in a district court.

> Tan Hong Sheng‚Äôs mother reported the matter to the police and a warrant of arrest was issued against him. He was arrested, then handed another charge ‚Äî this time for rioting outside Club Secret at Central Mall in Clarke Quay at about 3.30am on Aug 9.

> Video footage of the incident posted online shows a group of at least 20 youths fighting in a car park.

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( Singapore law a joke nowadays. Didn‚Äôt see the video footage so idk but it does sound like a pussypass that the only girl in a group of guys charged for murder got her charge reduced.. Makes sense. I doubt she knew her drinking mates were actually gonna kill the guy they were fighting. Must have just thought it's just another fight. Would be ridiculous to stick her with murder charge.. This makes sense assuming she only intended to cause hurt. I think it will be excessive for her to be charged with murder.. r/PussyPass. She's not held to be ""less culpable"". Just to be clear - the court hasn't ruled on this case yet. The prosecution just decided to charge the accused with VCH instead of murder. As to why - no one except the AGC will know. Probably because they have a weak case if they try and push for a murder charge, so they're settling for VCH instead. But ultimately my guess is as good as yours.. It could be that she really only intended to beat the man up. The other 3 men still face murder charge.

The amount of information about the case revealed to the public barely scratches the surface, but I guess it's not going to stop redditors from being armchair lawyers/detectives.. dude, she's Albert Einstein!. good grades?. Remember the downtown east murder? None of them were charged with murder. That incident was even more premeditated than this one too.. Hmm.. there were originally seven people charged - six men and one woman.

[Three men were given a ""discharge amounting to an acquittal""](

Now the only woman has her charge reduced.

Do you want to explain why it counts as a ""pussypass"" when half the men originally charged got off ""lighter""...?. How would we know her intentions? We can only judge by her actions.. Ah I see, many thanks for the correction. I was under the impression that the judge ruled it and not a change because of the prosecution.

The point about weak case is interesting though, they have video footage of the incident so in my mind, it was a cut and dry case to begin with. The defense would push for mitigate and hopefully assist them to avoid the death penalty while prosecution would push for death penalty. At least this was how it played out when I read about this case.. give it a rest dude... lol. Spare the poor horse pls. wha i remember that one. just went to read on it, it was a brutal attack/death. BUT the murderers were aged below 21 at the time, and should be fairly sentenced as minors in accordance to the law. their punishment is still harshed though, with about 10 years jail + 10 strokes of cane. 

this case all like above 21 = full fledged adult. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Wasn‚Äôt aware of the other 3 men, stand corrected.. Need to prove both the physical act and the fault element. The video deals with the act, but because she didnt do the killing blow, maybe no evidence to show intention/common intention. Or might be plea bargain.. [deleted]. i think accountability is very important, especially for such a high position such as a judge. so until that final verdict is out, i will try to follow it closely. 

just dont report me as fake news.. I mean they can still charge 299 with common intention or abetment by instigation, no killing blow can kena.. I agree with you, i just think the NUS meme is just boring and stale at this point.. i still see the need to give that comment, to reflect how poorly the case was handled... the amount of confidence in the justice system has yet to be restored, for me at least.. I think there are legal nuances that we need to comprehend before rushing to judgement. I don't like that the NUS guy got a light sentence, but if he is truly mentally ill, then the solution is obviously psychiatric treatment. Far too often we rely on our emotions and lash out, instead of looking at issues objectively.. oh. no la. if diagnose by psychiatrist as mentally ill all is ok. were there any such results declared? 

i only disagree with how the judge treated the whole issue. comments such as minor intrusions or potential to excel in life... the judge intention to ‚Äúbe lenient‚Äù for terence backfired and his act goes viral instead. blowing the whole matter up for unnecessary attention... everyone (victim and culprit) suffering more.. > if diagnose by psychiatrist as mentally ill all is ok. were there any such results declared? 

I don't think there was, but that's not my point. If someone has a pattern of repeat criminal behaviour, then that might be indicative of mental illness. We need to investigate to know for sure. I'm saying its a possibility. the potential to excel in life thing is nonsense, i agree with you on that.. indicative of mental illness, yes. it is up to the person‚Äôs choice to seek medical help. even actual prisoners should have the access to do so. BUT the diagnosis is the upmost importance. we are talking about using it in legal defence... even having another psychiatrist to cross examine might be needed depending on the severity of the crime. 

hell no to self diagnosis or armchair psychiatrist theory.  mental illness is a serious issue that have no room for self diagnosis. so yes, i will go as far to say that anyone who (self) claims terence have mental illness is retarded and counter productive to mental health awareness.. I'm talking about an actual diagnosis of mental health issues. Anything less is insufficient. But mentally ill people aren't aware of their mental illness, it is up to us moral citizens to lend a helping hand. 
Don't use the R word. We are talking about mental health issues here, such ableism does not sit well with me.. so ya. he would be advised to seek proper medical attention = psychiatrist diagnosis. hence i asked that at the start. 

never a self diagnosis... too much ‚Äúi have depression/OCD shit‚Äù going around that undermines the real attention needed for sufferers from depression/OCD. same for armchair psy. i have immense hate for those. 

the only way out for mental health is to always advise proper medical attention.. >never a self diagnosis... too much ‚Äúi have depression/OCD shit‚Äù going around

How do you know those are fabricated? Why so quick to judge? Not attacking you, just curious. they suspect to have it, go seek help, the sooner the better. get the correct answer/treatment from there. things can be worked in the forward direction (easily) with current medical science. 

bringing it up as ‚Äúan excuse/saying‚Äù without any intention to seek medical treatment does not do any thing IF they are real sufferers. all else, they draw sympathetic acts and ‚Äúnormalise‚Äù the wrong symptoms of the medical condition, which hampers real sufferers to act upon their own condition. 

i do not judge them to be with or without the illness (not the doctor). i just judge the action of self diagnosis.",1878.0,10,1,1

P sure the branch at hillv2 has it. you can make this yourself easily with lime/calamansi, sugar syrup and soda water.. Where can you get it for cheap ah? I usually get it for $1 at NTUC but it's sold out now :(. you lil shit, sharing is caring :‚Äô(. Most places sell out really fast the moment it goes on the shelf. It's pretty much a investment item now. No, but they got removed in favour of the less/no sugar versions because they are healthier.. Sweet. Thanks for the heads up. Ya but i really just prefer to buy. I also dk leh. been damn long since I even came across it. Used to buy it from minimarts when I was a kid. The more atas places don't seem to carry it. The yellow one tasted quite good too. Think it was fruit punch flavoured milk. The green one was green apple flavoured milk if i'm not wrong.. Schweppes does a [canned]( version, not sure if you can find it in SG.. Yep. Bought before but not easy to.find. supermarkets dont stock up on those",708.0,4,49,1
111,Why does Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin sounds similar?,dk2now,2019-10-19 11:42:50,"Aussie here learning Mandarin. There is this mystery I have wondered about for a very long time, ever since I started with Mandarin years ago. I noticed that Mandarin spoken in Taiwan and Singapore sounds exactly the same and is very different to Mandarin spoken in China.

As far as I know, no one has noticed how Singapore and Taiwanese sounds so similar. I've searched online but there was nothing about it. I've asked Chinese people about this, but they either don't know what Singapore Mandarin is like, or don't know what Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin is like. When I asked the Taiwanese, they too don't know what Singapore Mandarin is like.

Recently, I met someone from Singapore and we spoke in Mandarin. Immediately I feel like I'm speaking to a Taiwanese person. I told her that her accent sounds like Taiwanese and I have always thought that both accents sounds so similar. She said it's very actually very different, but she couldn't give an explanation. Funny enough, we at a food fair together and later she was speaking to one of the food vendors who was Chinese. They were speaking in Mandarin about the food and at one point the guy said ""...ÂæàÂ•ΩÂêÉÔºå‰Ω†‰ª¨Âè∞Êπæ‰∫∫ÂñúÊ¨¢ÁöÑ"". It was the first time I saw someone else made the connection between Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin, other than myself. So I know it isn't just me that thinks this.

Taiwan and Singapore are so far and have nothing to do with each other. China is closer to Singapore and has a way bigger population than Taiwan. Singapore Chinese people are descendants of people from China, not Taiwan. As far as I know, there wasn't any special historical or modern relationship and interactions between the two places. So why would Singapore have a similar accent to Taiwan, and not China? 

Please enlighten me guys, I have been on this for too long.",52,0.85,56.0,"I'm half Singaporean and half Taiwanese and I don't think the accents sound all too similar.  In Taiwan people think I'm Singaporean and in Singapore, they think I'm Taiwanese.  Though actually Mandarin could be considered a second language for a lot of Chinese people in SG as well.

Even the Hokkien spoken in Taiwan is a bit different from that in Singapore.  That's not to say we don't understand each other, but we can definitely tell when someone is from SG vs Taiwan.

Recently though it seems like there's less difference in the accents because a lot of Taiwanese dramas are available in SG.. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related, but both a majority Taiwanese people and a majority of Singaporeans of chinese descent are descendants of immigrants from the Fujian province of China, where the native language is Hokkien (it‚Äôs called Taiwanese in well, Taiwan). That might contribute to how the native language influences the way a foreign language is spoken although today mandarin dominates in both countries.. To us, we sound really different. Taiwanese can tell immediately we're not Taiwanese from our accent. China is a really huge country with many different kind of accents due to the different dialects they speak. Our accent is influenced by English so it somehow affected our tone of certain Chinese words and the tone at the end of our sentences differently. And it's difficult for Singaporean to complete a sentence without English words in between.

One major difference is we have different pronunciation for certain words. For example rubbish is lƒÅ jƒ´ for us and l√® sh√® for them.. Here is my $0.02. The Taiwanese has a language dialect, which is [Taiwanese Hokkien]( In Singapore, the largest dialect group for the Chinese is Hokkien. So the similarities in terms of speaking are there. Many Malaysians share the same ""accent"" when we all speak in Mandarin. The sentence structures and certain descriptive words are all similar.

Of course, with Mandarin being Taiwan's first language, they are far more proficient and fluent when they speak. It's faster, more melodious, and the words that they use are vastly different from our simple Mandarin speaking skills. We Singaporeans use the Chinese language to order food, be informal with friends and family, or just to joke and relax. So the words and vocabulary is usually less complex. Unless you are a Chinese teacher at MOE.

Therefore, depending on who you ask, most Singaporeans will first tell you, it's so different. Because we know the nuances of the language, and we also know that we are not as fluent. 

However, if you have thought deeply about this subject, and have Malaysian, Taiwanese and Hong Kong friends, you'll probably realize that from an outsider's point of view, we do sound similar. 

Lastly, if you find Chinese people from Guangzhou, Guangdong, or even Xiamen, we may also sound somewhat similar. Personally, I first found Mediacorp actor Qi Yuwu's accent (he's from China) to be more Singaporean than Chinese when I first watched him on telly. Then, I realized he's from Guangzhou, and probably speak Cantonese or Hokkien as his dialect. 

Source: You're not alone. This is also one of my pet topics to think about when I'm bored.. Southern china mandarin sound similar as well. The stereotypical mainland china accent is from Beijing.

The way we speak a language is primarily influenced by our parents, who are in turn influenced by their grandparents and so on. Notice how singaporeans don't really pick up British or American accent even if we watch tons of youtube or TV series from overseas.

Edit: You can check out this video. Notice how much more similar southern accent is to Taiwan and Singapore's mandarin, since that's where most of our ancestors migrate from.

 As someone who is super into Taiwanese related shows, I can tell you that Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin definitely don't sound the same. The accent sounds different already but it may be quite difficult for some to catch it.. Most Singaporeans and Taiwanese would not think that the accents are similar. But I think what you're thinking is that, they are more similar than compared to mainland Chinese accents. 

Even in mainland China, the accents vary quite differently. Broadly speaking, there's Northern Chinese and Southern Chinese accents. Northern Chinese accents are ""heavier"" and have more Âç∑Ëàå compared to Southern Chinese accents which are ""flatter"". Both the Singaporean accent and Taiwanese accent fall on the flatter side of the spectrum. If you go to somewhere like Guangzhou in China, you might find their accents to be more similar to Singapore/Taiwan than somewhere like Beijing. 

>  Singapore Chinese people are descendants of people from China, not Taiwan.  

Well technically we all (Singaporeans/Taiwanese) came from the Southwest coast of China. Our ancestors migrated from Hainan, Fujian, Guangzhou, etc. The ancestors of Taiwan Chinese people mostly migrated from Fujian. The indigenous people of Taiwan are called Âéü‰ΩèÊ∞ë and have their own languages too.. Definitely different. When I'm in Taiwan, I said I'm Singaporean, they commented that my Mandarin was ""good for a Singaporean"", and asked me whether I have studied there. When i'm in Singapore, some locals thought I'm Taiwanese, but true blue Taiwanese would have known better.  


However I'm can definitely can default to the ""Singaporean Mandarin Accent"". I tend to speak more proper Mandarin (less English mixed in) to native Mandarin Speakers.. I've talked with a couple of Chinese primary school teachers by trade. Apparently we use the exact same Chinese learning method as Taiwan, explaining why the speech pattern is similar (not heavily accented like in certain regions of China). The main difference is how we're taught to write. Where we start with Simplified and learning Traditional is optional, the Taiwanese start with Traditional and official channels there demand Traditional.. I don‚Äôt have an answer for you, but when I was in university speaking Chinese to the mainlanders, they also commented that I sounded Taiwanese to them.. Back in the 90s, early 2000s, Taiwanese pop culture was very very popular here. We watched Taiwanese variety shows, idol dramas, we listened to Taiwan Chinese pop songs. Every now and then, Taiwanese artises, singers would pop by to meet the fans here. Naturally, the way we spoke Chinese got the Taiwan influence. The TV hosts here would say what the Taiwanese TV hosts said, like ÊéåÂ£∞ÈºìÂä±ÈºìÂä±, like how they described the taste of food, Âè£ÊÑüÁªµÂØÜÔºåÁàÜÊµÜ, ect.
It was until later on our gov started aligning to PRC standard, then we saw changes. Official channel we no longer say Âç∞Â∞ºÔºå Êæ≥Ê¥≤ but Âç∞Â∫¶Â∞ºË•ø‰∫öÔºåÊæ≥Â§ßÂà©‰∫ö, ect. We try to speak Chinese the way that easier for PRC to understand. But on the ground, the Taiwanese influence is still strong.. Because Taiwanese mandarin is better than western Taiwan mandarin.. From experience, sg uses language appropriation a lot, meaning we try to react with the same language usage that is common to your conditions or the environment, chinese as foundation can be adapted to malaysian chinese taiwanese chinese etc.

It happens uniquely to our society and maybe malaysian chinese as well, that we learn english or malay as the first language, there's a lot of fusion to other languages, cultivating the innate ability to change the tone quickly as per situation.

Not enough recognition is put into this aspect, if you realise, we get criticised a lot for our language when we are in singapore, but almost seemingly anybody can pull it off when in another country. Its similar to mimicking, i also think its safe to assume we watch many programmes from their sides too.. For a long time the official mandarin syllabus was based on Taiwanese mandarin because China was in its self imposed solitude back then. Just that we use simplified chinese characters. The actual phrases and vocabulary are Taiwanese style. 

Our accent isn‚Äôt similar to Taiwanese mandarin we and malaysia have what e Taiwanese call a southern nanyang accent.. OP, if you‚Äôve been studying Mandarin as long as you claim, you should know that the native dialect of Singaporeans and Taiwanese is ÈóΩÂçóËØ≠.  This explains why when they speak Mandarin it may sound somewhat similar to you.  But actually their accents are distinguishable.  Like their English accent lol.. Because of ÊàëÁåúÊàëÁåúÊàëÁåúÁåúÁåú.

From Batam here, watching Channel 8 from young age.

Mostly watching Taiwan shows like everyone.. They're different enough. The analogue best for you here is for someone learning English and asking why do Aussies and Kiwis sound similar.. It is not about the language, but about the accent. Local ethnic Chinese here in Singapore are made up of a majority from the Hokkien dialect group, which traced its ancestral origins to Fujian province. Many Chinese in Taiwan, to an even greater proportion than Singapore, have ancestors that came from the Hokkien dialect group in Fijian province. We inherited this accent from our parents, whom in turn inherited it from their own parents, in which case have a better-than-even chance of being first generation immigrants from southern China. 

Even so, there is some 'drift', especially among the 3rd generation. 

However, between ourselves, we can differentiate and tell the difference between ethnic Chinese from Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan based on ""accent"". It is not that obvious at times though, even among ourselves.. I've lived a couple of years in Taiwan, and I've been in Singapore for about 10 years now. Honestly, I feel the accents between mandarin speaking Taiwanese people and Singaporean people to be very different. It's so different that I can accurately guess when someone is from Taiwan.. uneduacated guess -   
for the most of the 80s ~ 90s, overseas chinese TV programmes (variety shows) are mainly from Taiwan. to a extend also from HK (TVB Drama series); while there're dubbing done for the original dialect dialouges, i highly suspect they're done in pretty much neutral accent.   
that said, still, we hear more spoken mandarin from Taiwanese artistes, as back then entertainment exports from PRC to SG is quite limited (except that classic mid-1980s CCTV-produced ""Journey to the West"".. L E G E N D)

>As far as I know, there wasn't any special historical or modern relationship and interactions between the two places.

\*raughs in Exercise Starlight*. One of my ex girlfriends who was shanghainese says my mando is very taiwanese. I do not agree though. 

I barely speak any mando as it is.. Our dialects will affect our intonation and speech habits. Singapore has a hokkien/teochew majority.

Most Malaysian Chinese speak Cantonese. You will find their manner of speaking similar to Hong Kongers.. Nah. Our mandarin sounds very different.. You might be thinking of the way northern Chinese people speak mandarin.

Even in south China today, most of the Chinese don't sound 'china' when speaking mandarin.. You‚Äôll have to understand that there‚Äôs no unified ‚ÄúChina accent‚Äù in China as well, because it‚Äôs so massive. The ‚ÄúChina accent‚Äù you‚Äôre referring to should be Beijing‚Äôs accent. 

The Cantonese people in Hongkong speak in a very distinct accent, and shanghai has a very different accent than Beijing as well. 

Taiwan and Singapore received a lot of southerner refugees due to the war between kmt and ccp, so we largely share a common ancestry. 

Be that as it may, there are significant differences between singaporean and Taiwanese pronunciation of different words, though you have to be native to hear the differences. 

Growing up, many Singaporean Chinese watched a lot of Taiwan shows as well, and ‚ÄúMediaCorp mandarin‚Äù has a very strong Taiwanese slant, which is also a factor to consider.. on the contrary, as someone who learnt Mandarin as a third language when I was a kid, I could hear the difference between all three (Singapore, China, Taiwan). I was **not** able to understand the Taiwanese accent until much later because it‚Äôs so slurred. 

also my friend is Taiwanese but grew up in Singapore from primary school onwards. you can hear the difference in accent when he speaks to Singaporeans vs when he speaks to his (Taiwanese) family.. Probably higher exposure to Taiwanese shows, hence picking up and using the lingos used.. Can I hijack this and ask you..

* how old are you?
* are you good with languages in general?
* how long are you learning Mandarin already?

I.. am interested. I'm mostly intimidated though... The words we use are totally different. Eg la ji and le se for rubbish in Singapore and Taiwan.. Right that makes sense, if both countries has this dialect, it would probably influence Mandarin.. I agree that we have quite different pronunciations for certain words, as we learn from the mainland chinese pronunciations (using hanyu pinyin rather than taiwan‚Äôs zhuyin) to a greater degree. And (Âíå) is pronounced ‚Äòhe‚Äô instead of ‚Äòhan‚Äô, Character (noun) (ËßíËâ≤) is ‚Äòjue se‚Äô instead of ‚Äòjiao se‚Äô, Liquid (Ê∂≤‰ΩìÔºâis ‚Äòye ti‚Äô rather than ‚Äòyi ti‚Äô.. Haha, that would explain why she was saying the word 'than' so much.. > rubbish is lƒÅ jƒ´ for us and l√® sh√® for them.

Apropos of nothing, I discovered this when I, as a very novice Mandarin learner, went to a McDonald's in China and attempted to order their equivalent to a McSpicy. It did not go as planned, and the nice cashier lady was very confused. This.  It is how the similar dialect influences how each side speaks Mandarin that is confusing the OP.  But it is also true that the Singapore accent for Mandarin is somewhat different than that of a Taiwanese.. Ah it's making sense now, thank you.

Haha, it's awesome that there is someone else who ponder about these things :D. This is really interesting! Thanks for sharing.. Tell that to amos yee lol. His accent ain‚Äôt from his parents.. Definitely difficult for me to suss out the difference.. That makes sense now, I did not know that Taiwanese people immigrated from China, relatively recently in Chinese history. If both Singaporeans and Taiwanese are descendants of people from the same area in China, that would explain the whole accent thing.. Right I see. Yeah I noticed that both Singaporeans and Taiwanese would say Êæ≥Ê¥≤ and not Êæ≥Â§ßÂà©‰∫û„ÄÇ. Aye?. I think the average Singaporean mandarin accent is alot closer to the Taiwanese one than the average Malaysian one though.... Yeah, but I only really focus on Chinese from the mainland, so I'm not familiar with mandarin and dialects outside of China.. Yes, but with Australia and New Zealand, there's a clear reason to why the accent sounds similar. That is, both were British colonies, settled around the same time and have special relationships with each other throughout history.. Not at all. Malaysian Cantonese is rather different from the Hong Kong variant.. Intimidated? How so?. Yes I noticed, however some words are also used in both countries, like Êæ≥Ê¥≤ instead of Êæ≥Â§ßÂà©‰∫û.. Judging from your post history you are from Perth.  I am Chinese, I can speak both Mandarin and Cantonese, as well as English. Most people in Australia are cantonese people (myself included) and so you are more familiar with Guangdong mandarin accents(most still speak cantonese). Perth doesn't have a lot of immigrants so hop over to Sydney and explore Hurstville, Chatswood, UNSW, Chinatown, Burwood, Eastwood, Campsie to explore Chinese Australians.  

When I went to Singapore, my parents noticed(they were born in China) that Singaporeans are Hokkein people as there was ""Ang Mo Kio"" which is clearly not standardised Chinese. They didn't get it at the start. Furthermore Singaporeans call their Chinatown niucheshui but we call it tangrenjie. I love Sydney.. . Lz
M. It's forced.. Counter got reset!. Right, yes, that's true, but what I was trying to say is that they are different to those who are familiar with the language. Native speakers (or even a Singaporean banana like me) generally can hear the differences.

I think the other thing is that if you're comparing to the northern Chinese accents (like Beijing), then yes, it will be stark. It's a bit like comparing scouse to Aussie and American accents.. >u/SlwWlkng

Yah malaysian cantonese is quite different from HK canto...its got this twangy heavy accent. * no relationship to any language I've encountered
* hard time hearing (let alone reproducing) tones
* pinyin is hard to make sense of and lots of material seems to target native English speakers
* shy/introvert. *Niuchesui* is a place name specifically referring to Singapore's Chinatown around Kreta Ayer Rd (kereta air = bullock cart water in Malay, so the same meaning).  *Tangrenjie* can refer to any Chinatown anywhere.. o i didnt know that I was wondering the same thing. Your chinatown is good, our's is rubbish in Sydney",2760.0,8,313,1

Go exchange them for $10 from the Japanese government.. There's always money in the banana ~~stand~~.. I have one! High five. ‚úã.

Please PM me back if you have old Malaysia, Dubai, Zimbabwe, China, Singapore, blah blah blah coins or notes for sale! Open price for pieces is RM10,000.. I know a lot of people are wondering what I‚Äôm going to do with them. Nothing because 1. These belong to my grandma and she is still very much alive. I can only stake my claim of banana money once she‚Äôs no longer here. And I hope that won‚Äôt be anytime soon. So basically this is all I want for my inheritance. Her old stuff. Ive already claimed for all her coins and notes. So we‚Äôll see how it goes.. Yeah, these are pretty common.

Ironically, during the occupation, Straits money became even more valuable.. Would like to have them. I have a three inch thick stack of this stuff! If you ever figure out what to do with it please let me know because I know it's pretty much worthless, but it's still kinda cool.. National Museum would love this.. Keep it ;) might be worth a dime or two in the future. I donno why but this makes me sad. I would like to have them if you don't want it.. Wow you must keep them! It can become a family heirloom. Frame it up and preserve it op. Waiting for those ""collecting old brunei, malaysia, Singapore currency, PM if selling"". Wow... the exact same thing happened to me. Was clearing my grandma‚Äôs old things and also stumbled on banana money.... My granddad had these too! Not sure what happened to them. Do you plan on selling them? I love collecting money and I'd be very interested. I think hell money has stronger currency than this. Do you plan on keeping them? I love history and collecting that would be incredible!! (i dont mind paying as long as its a reasonable price). go crosspost this to r/oldschoolcool. Tkey still in mint condition? Sell it to me sgd 2 per piece.nego.no bs. ÁßçÁìúÂæóÁìú ÁßçË±ÜÂæóË±Ü. Since is banana currency, just go to fruit stall and buy banana using the banana currency.. I'm assuming this is the Philippines and the dollars they speak of are American.. Which is why they were worthless. Anyone could print it and nobody would be wiser.. Congratulations!  

You have won:  Admission ticket for One Pax to Sook Ching Exercise. **NO TOUCHING!**. Can confirm. Am banana. God, those ads are super annoying.. He's everywhere man. I came to the comments searching for this lol. are they like scammers or something. genuinely curious. BITCONNEEEEEEEEECT. Am honest man and deal with sincerity. It's pretty cool to have a small piece of history for collection :). I‚Äôve done some currency collection before but havent touch it for about 6 years. Banana notes do not even have much value these days and they are actually abundant in the market then even till now when i visited the so-called mini sungei flea market at toa payoh. not sure whether its still there.
Edit: Still a pretty cool piece of history though.. Carousell. Though validating their authenticity will be a challenge.. But they are historical, why would they still be worthless. Depends on which ones you have. The first edition ones are worth a little more. The one OP has are second edition which are almost worthless.. Any chance you could sell/spare them? I'm genuinely into history and I'd love to have a set. maybe you're OPs brother. I have a freshly minted $1 coin. Can deal at your price. No BS. I can't buy President Yusof Ishak using the current money, so how does that work?. Why would you assume this is the Philippines on r/Singapore?

And why do you assume the dollars to be American?. These banana money replaced the Straits dollars when Japan occupied Malaysia and Singapore.

edit: For example, one of the notes has letters ""MN"". M is for Malaya, N is the printing batch.. Well they need their cannon inkjet printers to function first.. >printers
>1945
>during wartime occupation

Heh. 

They're worthless because the japanese overprinted, they themselves fucked the currency up, no external input necessary.. Serial numbers don‚Äôt help everyday people catch counterfeit currency, only the authorities. Nobody looks at the numbers, you‚Äôre much more likely to catch counterfeits because of the texture of the note or the pigmentation etc. The real Halloween Horror Nights. Yup  Where is this toa payoh flea market?. There are far too many banana notes for any of them to be worth anything. I believe the ones I have are the same as OP, no serial numbers.. Yeah sure! I'd be happy to give away one set of the notes.. Wow really dude?I wasn't being sarcastic.but hey whatever floats your boat.have a good one. The ink cartridges would cost more than the money you could print would have been worth even when it was still currency.. i think they should have used bitcoin.. Goddamn overinflation thanks to them. Why didn't the jap occupiers just use the standard yen? Did they introduce banana notes just so they can print money?. r/underratedcomment. > Victims would then receive fake receipts from scammers as proof of successful payments and asked to pay administrative fees to the scammers.

How do people still fall for this? Isn't this the same modus operandi of the Nigerian inheritance scams of old?. near courts at toa payoh central.. I mean its hard to calculate worth vs value especially for notes like this.

Are they useless as currency? Undoubtedly.

Would I pay a dollar or two to own a piece? Maybe.

Considering the amount of garbage people buy on Shopee/Lazada just because it was on flash sale, it's not hard to imagine that they can have some interesting historical value now.. I would love to have 1 set and don‚Äôt mind buying from you too! Let me know? üòÄ. Low ball offer man. Venezuela but just a few years earlier.. I think you mean Hyperinflation.... I'm guessing it's due to the occupied territories being under military occupation rather than civil administration. Colonies also use their own currency as well instead of the currency of their colonisers.. Controlling people. Actually all currencies are like that, making your own currency allows you to enact controls on finance of the people who use the money. 

Some control their currency much more than others cough cough usdollar cough nk cough rmb cough (although nk rn is more like a voucher than money at this point)

Wartime currency is just the most stringent kind, and wouldn't you want to seperate domestic finance with occupation finance?. what do you mean, there are no hot single attractive females near my area?. Same shit different bowl, man. Even I didn't think much of it until I saw it pop up all over Instagram. And it's pretty targeted at seniors too, since they're the ones with old currencies. Icic. Might check out when I'm ard there next time haha.. Yeah totally! Pm me and we can sort out the logistics. Have you seen the venezuela inflation meme. Yes. Also, even in 2019 there are still ex-French colonies in Africa who still pay tribute to France and many dealings are done in Francs. While France has officially adopted the Euro, dealings are still done in Fracs undergoing exchange rates. 



It is one of the reasons why France initiated the War on Libya. It was never about democracy or overthrowing a dictator. It was because Gaddafi wanted to introduce a new currency standard for the African continent, replacing petrol dollars (USD) and Francs using Gold. 

2019, Libya is still in a mess due to sins of the past (Western Colonization). There are. They just aren't interested.. üòÖ. **CFA franc**

The CFA franc (in French: franc CFA [f Å…ëÃÉ se…õf…ë], or colloquially franc) is the name of two currencies, the West African CFA franc, used in eight West African countries, and the Central African CFA franc, used in six Central African countries. Both currencies are guaranteed by the French treasury. Although separate, the two CFA franc currencies have always been at parity and are effectively interchangeable. The ISO currency codes are XAF for the Central African CFA franc and XOF for the West African CFA franc.

sUREE. All those years of medical school just to culminate in this.. > # Ler Teck Siang, doctor involved in HIV data leak, jailed for drug offences

> Ler Teck Siang, the Singaporean doctor involved in the HIV Registry data leak saga, was found guilty yesterday of injecting a drug abuser for a fee and for possessing drug utensils.

> Ler, 38, whose nine-day trial spanned five months, was sentenced to 15 months in jail on two charges: Possession of a drug-stained syringe, and a charge of injecting methamphetamine into a Sim Eng Chee last year.

> Ler was arrested with Sim, a convicted drug abuser, at Conrad Centennial Singapore hotel on March 2 last year, after hotel staff found drugs in Sim's hotel room and called the police.

> During Ler's sentencing yesterday, District Judge Christopher Goh said this was ""a tale of drug consumption and sex that unravelled"" for Ler as the other ""protagonist"", Sim, did not realise he was assigned to a new hotel room. Hotel staff thus found drugs while Sim was out procuring more drugs, the district judge said.

> Sim earlier testified in court that he had hired Ler for ""slamming"" services - slang for the administration of illegal drugs via injection - ahead of group sex sessions with other men.

> But Ler countered that he had provided ""massage services"" to Sim.

> District Judge Goh said he found Sim's testimony more believable than Ler's, as his evidence was consistent with the text messages between the two, and he came across as one who has seen the error of his ways.

> Sim answered the questions clearly and to the point, even when what he said might have caused him embarrassment, added the district judge.

> But Ler's claim of providing massage services was not raised in his statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau, said the district judge.

> ""I found his attempts to explain drug references in the text messages difficult to accept,"" he said.

> For example, Ler had claimed that the ""coke"" mentioned in their text messages referred to the soft drink Coca-Cola, while the ""poke"" was in reference to the Facebook ""poke"" function.

> ""I was, in fact, incredulous at some of these explanations,"" said District Judge Goh.

> He also rejected Ler's explanations for the drug-stained syringe found on him. Ler first claimed that the syringe was used to flush food particles out of his teeth, then later said it was from his former partner Mikhy Farrera-Brochez's study.

> ""I agree with the prosecution that this explanation was an afterthought,"" said the district judge.

> In calling for a sentence of 15 months in jail, Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Wuan said Ler had committed the offences for greed, and had done ""precisely what a doctor ought not to do"".

> ""His commission of the offences at the expense of others is abhorrent,"" said DPP Wuan.

> District Judge Goh added that a sentence of 15 months in jail was fair, and that the prosecution, who included Deputy Public Prosecutor Desmond Chong, had made a concession by not requesting the sentences to run consecutively.

> This sentence will run after Ler finishes serving his two-year term for helping HIV-positive Farrera-Brochez cheat the authorities into issuing a work pass.

> Ler and Farrera-Brochez are at the centre of a HIV Registry scandal, in which the details of 14,200 HIV-positive patients were leaked online.

> Correction note: An earlier version of the story had the wrong name of the District Judge. We are sorry for the error.

Is there any ghost stories behind this place? Seems like there would be one.... How accesible is this place? I might want to explore it.. My SO did a study on this place for her thesis. While interesting place no doubt it's a bit of a stretch to compare it to Angkor Wat the ancient millennia old temple complex. Malaysia's Bujang Valley or Indonesia Borobudur is more apt.. Chicken rice recipe hidden inside.. As referenced to several articles from ST and TODAY:

'Hainanese immigrants, who were the last of the Chinese communities to settle in Singapore, established the kampung in the 1930s.

By the 1960s, it was housing close to 100 residents who came from various dialect groups and ethnicities.

After the last resident left in the 1980s due to housing development plans, the land was eventually covered by secondary forest.'

Hope this helps!. It's a buffer park outside the actual CCNR.. Dude, if you listened to all the ghost stories about sg, practically every inch of the country is haunted.... You'll have to walk a lot to get inside there. And if you are coming from the north, pray hope you got a car.. Somehow EVERY school used to be a cemetery for some reason lol.

116,I'm an NSF going to Uni next year after I ORD. I have a spot in NUS for engineering. I haven't done anything academic since I enlisted. Any advice for me?,dk23pi,2019-10-19 10:43:25,I'm also considering changing my course but I'm not sure what to pick. I have no real passion for any subject.,3,0.54,32.0,"Was in the same position as you. 

You dont have to do anything until you enter because unless you know the syllabus, you probably dont know what to study. If you do, then yes you can study.

The truth is,engineering can get you job. Dont expect the pay to be mindblowing unless you have high skill or you are studying something that will be in demand 4 years down the road for your case. 

You can take up things you want to learn, like driving etc. Once you get into uni, use your breaks to do internship.. Rather than spending time revising JC maths and Physics which you should be able to recall quite easily and which will likely only be useful for the first semester, go read up on the 3 different pathways and the types of degrees available that NUS Engin offers. 

The 3 pathways are Practising Professional Pathway (PPP), Innovation & Design Programme (iDP) and Research-focused Pathway (RfP). The types of degrees/progammes offered include Second Minor, Single Degree with Second Majors, Double Degree with Single/Double Honours, Global Engineering Programme (Masters in 4 years), University Scholars Programme (USP) and the most atas one NUS French Double Degree Program ( 2 years in NUS, 2 years in some french uni).

If anything, reading up extensively on these programmes, as well as NUS Hall/Residential College life and Semester Exchange Programmes will prepare you the most because of all the reading/research you're gonna have to do for modules anyway lol. Looking at the recommeded schedule for my course, the common engineering modules throughout the first 2 undergrad years, from this academic year onwards, seem to be  MA1505 Mathematics¬†I,  PC1431/PC1432 Newtonian/Nuclear Physics,  MLE1010 Materials¬†Engineering¬†Principles¬†&¬† Practice,  EE2211 Introduction¬†to¬†Machine¬†Learning,  IE2141 Systems¬†Thinking¬†and¬†Dynamics¬†.

Last but not least, do consider taking up a Special Term module (somewhere in May-June) before u enroll in aug.. would recommend taking CS1010X IBLOC, so you dont have to worry about CS in your first sem. Try to get what myt be the syllabus from upperclassmen

Then go to the internet to get a head start

Perhaps watch the khan academy the subjects or outright try those courses in the MIT online open courses. Read Engineering for Dummies.. No need to study. Uni will teach concepts from scratch. Just try to keep up any good study habits you had in school.. think abt wad kind of life you want to lead after uni

8-5? 60-70 hr weeks? jobs that fly every weekend? 7-10k entry level positions? or just want to start yr own thing?

the next 4 yrs will have a large impact on yr opportunities. Chill a bit, enjoy the much needed break before hell starts. Maybe try recalling your differentiation etc

And do some basic coding. Like hello world, handling basic input output etc. campaign for **gender equality**

a.k.a. female conscription. Alright. I'm not expecting mind-blowing pay lol. I'm more worried about the 4 years I'll spend in uni than what comes afterward. Will I be able to cope when I start though? I'm planning on revisiting some math and physics 6 months before ORD.. Wow. Tks for all this info.. If I wanna self learn what programming language do I learn?. I don't know mate. I don't have an idea of what life is or what it's supposed to be like. I think 8-5 should be fine. 7-10k entry level sounds like way too much lol.. Alright thanks mate.. When I become Chief of Army.. U from jc or poly. Most engineering students take CS1010E which is taught in Python. Only Computer Engineering (and infosec) takes CS1010 which is in C. I would recommend picking up python, and if you can, Matlab since that will be useful for the maths modules.. > 8-5 should be fine.

thats fine dude. den no need think so much, just get yr degree n date many girls. JC (international school actually but whatever works). In case I'm unable to pick up some basic coding am in real trouble? Or do they start from scratch?. Lol. I just want my degree. No need girls. Haha.. >date many girls

in engin? lol. Uhorny monkey?. Hmmm what course are you going in? I guess math and physics will be the most important. But i myself sucks at physics and forget almost everything i learnt in poly but i can handle it in the end.

The thing is uni is much harder than poly, but it's not impossible. If you want to know more, maybe be more specific in what you wanna know. They will start from scratch, but it's incredibly fast paced. I'm in CEG and knew some C beforehand so I'm fine for CS1010. Amongst my classmates with little to no programming experience, the ones who are working hard and doing plenty of practice are doing just fine, while those who sleep during lecture and never come to tutorial are dying. It's perfectly possible to do extremely well on CS1010/1010E with no prior experience, as long as you put the work in.. Current CS1010E for Engin is on Python, previous years were C. You will start from scratch and most of the cohort has zero coding background or experience so don‚Äôt worry about that, everyone learns together (of course there will be one or two people who did Python before but doesn‚Äôt matter).. Depressed sociopath monkey. Sorry, I beg to differ. It's probably going to be harder for you to keep up initially if you're from JC since the system and rubrics are very different. It takes some time to catch up. If you're from poly, you usually go straight to year 2(if you're taking something similar) which also has it's own set of difficulties. Takes a few months to acclimatize to the whole uni environment and pace. Make friends so that you guys can help each other out and you'll be reminded of deadlines which u may forget.. I'm going for engineering but it's common first year. I wanna know what the workload is like.. Aight then. Time to learn some hacking shit.. You will be taking at least one of these modules: [MA1508E](, [MA1511](, [MA1512](, [PC1431](, [PC1432](, and [CS1010E]( 

First three are pure maths: revise your calculus, and pick up some linear algebra if you can.

The physics modules are also varsity-level: get used to using calculus in physics to solve problems. A simple one: find the moment of inertia of a thin rod with density at a point on the rod, proportional to the distance of that point from the light end of the rod.

Or find the magnitude and direction of the electric field at an arbitrary direction from a ring of charge, where the charge increases anticlockwise from 0 to *c*. 

You *must* use calculus to solve both problems. 

CS1010E is a rather straightforward intro to CS. Get familiar with basic programming ideas like procedural, functional, declarative, and object-oriented programming, and abstraction; common programming constructs like variables, functions, looping and control constructs, objects, pointers and the idea of a stack and heap. Might seem like a lot, but the course will cover this in a matter of 4-5 lectures. If you're game, you should be able to learn these concepts within a couple of weeks of focused learning. 

Trust me: having a head-start will *really* help.. I am not sure about common, but i will say this in the perspective of mae and eee. First year will be more on basics like math and physics and programming c language. Then you will jump into your course of study. 

Mae will learn about how mechanics works, things like force diagram, moment, torque etc etc. You will learn about gears , then design of a mechanical object. As you move deeper, you will learn more technical stuff. Engineering drawing, before taking on the final challenge, final year project.

Eee will be similar, but you probably learn about circuit designs, power design. Those are stuff you will never see during jc.

The truth is, engineering is tough and more often than not, unrewarding. It will be very fast pace and you might choke. Just try your best and your first and second sem is the most important in determining your gpa. I climbed from 4.0 to 4.44 so its not impossible. I almost got to first class but ohwell..",1375.0,31,21,1

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( At least the author acknowledges that they are still young and shouldn't be so pessimistic. At least a girl with mental illness can still get dates. Most women won't touch a guy with mental illness.. We must change the way society view mental illness..especially in Asia. Mental illness is scarier than physical illness because  people think it is nothing just because they cannot see it.. Only someone who has been through it - will not want to subject their children to the same fate. So they choose not to had kids at all or even date to begin with.. Marriage is basically a promise, a commitment, a tall order. Means she must meet that tall order, and it's for him!

And it's for him in the sense that three fingers also pointing her, it's also for her. It's for them!

And if the result is good, thumbs up mannnnn.

And if the result is lousy what happen?

BOOOO!

BOOOO TO MENTAL ILLNESS!

Thank you fellow Singaporeans. Article kinda misses the point by focusing on marriage though, that is kinda narrow in scope. Would be better served trying to highlight the accompanying stigma of mental illnesses and trying to cope, or the stigma of entering a rs with a mentally ill person (and how to cope), as compared to what comes off as a personal rant against marriage.

PS: btw after checking the medical literature, schizo genetic inheritance rate of first degree relative is 6% as opposed to the 10% as quoted in the article.. Schizos are benign mental disorder sufferers and she‚Äôs pretty self aware and considerate. 

Wait till you meet borderlines, narcissists and sociopaths.. Props to her for being responsible and not selfish.. Person sounds like high self awareness. 

It‚Äôs true that a lot of the drugs cause weight gain as side effect. This affects girls more than guys because it‚Äôs ok for guys to be bbfa but less socially accent for girls to be bb. Anyway this is essentially the story for the joker movie. Siaolang no friend no romance.. Your flair seems very relevant OP.. All women are crazy. 

Here's the supporting theory from a wise person:
 I heard schizophrenia is the most heritable mental illness, so your mom and her siblings are definitely lucky.. [deleted]. Hard truths. Girls get attention merely for being a girl.. wow well done, crazy how you memoried that LOL. wait so you're the joker?. schizo really have a high element of heritability (13%). just sharing that there could still be a slight positive outlook to the illness. 

the sad part is >!they had another 3 siblings who pass away in the early years of infancy. back then no doctors kind of thing. among the 3 how many would have schizo is unknown.!<

some types of schizo can be taken care by modern medicine very well. so the author should discuss it with her doctor too. but ya, living with someone with the illness isnt easy... and too hard for any regular joe.. whether she had schizo before or after having the children is unknown. in those days, having children is everything. people with mental illness do not know that they do, and the fact that they could function properly in their daily life serve to ‚Äúproof‚Äù themselves correct. that was the attitude back then. medical science about all things mental were in the wrong direction too. 

its a luxury to view things in the past with current day knowledge. but decisions made then accounts only for the circumstances known at that time. would japan have invaded in WW2 had they knew they would be nuked twice? hell i would even know all toto winning numbers. 

irresponsible isnt the right word here, though i get your point in todays context.. That's some incel talk right there. Actually if you open your eyes and look, normal guys get attention too.

The ones that don't are actually the ones who put in 0 effort for themselves - sloppy dressing, too ~~quiet~~ boring, 0 understanding of body language, etc.

If girls don't pay attention to you, maybe it's time you started paying attention to yourself first.. Why did you have to add a spoiler tag?. I don't have trouble getting attention from anyone, this is just an observation which seems to tick people off. I have seen girls who dress sloppy and are socially awkward, but people around kindly help ease them into the social environment. On the other hand, the socially anxious guys do not get the same amount of leeway or respect. This is gender roles coming into play.. Ok, this I have to agree with.

Girls do get it easier but it isn't as bleak for guys as you made it sound like.. I was agreeing on the point about girls with mental illness vs guys with mental illness. I never mentioned anything about an average guy having no chance to get with girls. The kids here on r/sg are very trigger happy when it comes to downvoting and calling people incel apparently. Perhaps I didn't state my point clearly which opened up to misunderstanding.. Oh, I'm sorry the misunderstanding. 

I know about the downvoting situation here. So sorry you have to go through it.

> I was agreeing on the point about girls with mental illness vs guys with mental illness.

Yeah, that's why there is a saying ""Don't stick it in crazy"" but there is no saying ""Don't let crazy stick it in you"" because people don't even think about it.. But as long as you're physically attractive there will still be people who will risk the crazy....",2331.0,16,1,1

This lady lmao. The title says it all. Staying after office hours is already the norm, emails and msgs after work hours are also accepted part of work life here.
A manager in my company would regularly send emails on weekends and odd hours and the worse thing is a colleague who would reply. I don't know what life these people have outside the office, that's their issue, but they should not expect others to spend time outside work as they do.. Imagine if the topic was turned around to state: ‚ÄúHigher birth rate? Not happening in Singapore, says experts‚Äù. If the 7-14 entitled days of leave wasn't set in stone by MOM you bet companies would do their best to not follow it.. Working culture Singapore generally still subscribes to the idea that if you keep workers at the workplace for x% longer, then their output will be x% greater. Could be true if the job involves just brainlessly pushing a few buttons over and over, but anything that requires physical strength, deep thought, creativity or mental focus just won't meet that expectation. We have some of the longest average hours but our productivity is shit, thanks to the lack of regard for the simple principle of diminishing returns.. Be like Australians. Arrive on the dot, leave on the dot and say no to whoever is late.. If only employees can bill the company for time spent on emails and text messages after office hours.... This was becoming a norm in my dept and high management became worried. What happened is that we now just have a duty roster so once a month we have to standby on the weekend and everyone else wouldn't be affected. that's why SG is the most competitive overworked and sleep deprived country in the world. European here:

First of all, trying to lump all European countries' work culture together really doesn't work. This article is about French law and work culture vs Singapore - not about Europe in general.

Second, I both receive and send email after hours often - it is simply necessary as I work for an international company with locations around the globe. I am in Singapore right now, and will (of course) send emails in the morning to Europe. That is not considered an issue in my company, but on the other hand, we would not call anyone out of hours unless it was an emergency.

We also do not expect anyone to answer their emails (or text messages or Skype for Business for that matter) out of hours. We expect them to respond when they are back in the office.

Having a work/life balance is important. Workers tend to be more competitive if they lead a balanced life.

It starts with you. Stop checking your email or work phone out of hours.. Who even has time or mood for kids when such a toxic work culture exist?. Tried this once and got a tongue lashing. > # No work emails, text messages after office hours? Not happening in S'pore, say experts

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî No sending of emails after work hours. No phone calls or text messages, too.

> But while some employees in Singapore would love it if such restrictions, which are common in Western countries, exist here, it is unlikely to happen anytime soon. The obstacles are the need to maintain a competitive economy and the entrenched culture among workers here to be available round the clock, human resource experts said.

> The stark difference between the work cultures in Singapore and Europe was brought to the fore when last month,¬†former actress Sharon Au ‚Äî who moved from Singapore to Paris in March last year ‚Äî said in an interview with a Singapore radio station¬†that her colleagues at the French private equity firm that she works for had reported her to the human resources department.

> TODAY spoke to several employees in Singapore who said that they would welcome such laws here, although some acknowledged that it may be difficult to enforce such regulations for certain types of jobs.

> Ms Jayasutha Samuthiran, 28, who now lives in the Netherlands, said that while she was based in Singapore, it was the norm for her to receive emails after working hours from bosses or colleagues at the multinational company she works at. This is because her firm had to work closely with offices based in the United Kingdom.

> ‚ÄúColleagues and bosses in Singapore would go back home on time and spend time with family before going online again to tackle emails at around 9pm. You weren't expected to act on any of these emails at that hour though,‚Äù said Ms Jayasutha.

> EMPLOYEES HERE OPEN TO REGULATIONS ON AFTER-WORK COMMUNICATION

> Most employees whom TODAY spoke to feel that similar regulations, if implemented here, would help encourage work-life balance.

> Mr Raj Maran, who works in a technology startup, said that companies should set clear expectations on the time required for responding to work-related communication after office hours. For instance, employees could be given 24 hours to acknowledge emails.

> ‚ÄúThat will allow people to have the peace of mind outside of work and not worry about having to immediately reply,‚Äù said Mr Raj, 29.

> Others, such as Ms Tam, who wanted to be known only by her first name, proposed for a top-down approach to encourage work-life balance in Singapore.

> Citing the Government‚Äôs success in implementing the five-day work week, Ms Tam, 29, who works in the healthcare industry, said that regulations could be introduced to restrict after-office communication.

> The five-day work week arrangement was implemented across the civil service in 2004 to allow employees to spend more time with their families.

> She suggested that the Government start with a ‚Äúsofter‚Äù approach through public service announcements or advertisements to encourage people ‚Äúto see that there is a life outside of work‚Äù before eventually introducing regulation.

> A DIFFERENT CULTURE¬†

> Human resource experts said that there is still some way to go before Singapore could replicate the regulations or work culture in European countries.

> One key reason is the competitive nature of Singapore‚Äôs economy, which may require some workers to be contactable round the clock.

> ‚ÄúAs many global companies have their regional headquarters located in Singapore, sometimes it is necessary for employees to answer work emails or calls after working hours due to the time difference,‚Äù said Ms Linda Teo, the country manager of recruitment company ManpowerGroup Singapore.

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( Time to have a work phone that I don‚Äôt bring home, so no one can contact me when I‚Äôm out of office.. Brilliant experts.. I'm just glad my bosses do send emails out of hours, but do not expect replies until the work day starts.. I have a phone dedicated to work-related matters and it solved my concern for privacy. Long story short, I keep both lives distinctly apart and will only reply to colleagues/clients while heading towards work. Sometimes, I'll look at the notifications just before going to bed and mentally prepare an answer for tomorrow.

My workplace in general does not practice the need to reply outside of office hours but it is more about the clients we handle. Our Asian clients in particular, they replied at odd hours while expecting us to be their beck and call. Part of me feels that it is demeaning behaviour, especially since I have a life outside the office and not obliged to deal with their demands during that time-frame.. Surprise there isn't any ""strawberry bashing"" found on this post.. Happened to my friend before. A staff emailed her at midnight and expected immediate response. She has access to her inbox on her phone but avoids using it when she's off from work. Went to work the next day and receive a complaint email from that said staff for not responding. üôÑ. Well there's a reason why it's her former company. what a mad lad. Haha a VP in my company like to send email in the wee hour of the morning (like 2am). My guess is that he has insomnia.

Then early morning can see the managers jumping around in panic to reply to his email.. Entitled leave but they‚Äôll still expect you to reply emails on said leave. I wonder why no one gets this. Or those who do will still follow along with ""industry standard"" because that's what everyone else is doing. i worked in an office where most of them were Singaporeans educated in Australia, and wowww the work-life balance was AMAZING. basically mob manning oh wait .... I wouldn't mind working hard and being competitive if it actually led to something worthwhile. But doing more work only leads to more work.. >we would not call anyone out of hours unless it was an emergency.  
>  
>We also do not expect anyone to answer their emails (or text messages or Skype for Business for that matter) out of hours. We expect them to respond when they are back in the office.

This is reasonable but the problem is, the opposite happens in SG. Hence, everyone checks work messages outside of work. I agree that SGreans should start by not responding to work messages after work but many of them are afraid it will affect their performance evaluation and their career somewhere down the line. 

In my previous job, I got reprimanded for not answering a work-related message on a Saturday. The thing is, not everyone is willing to stand up against this toxic practice, so employers can always single out those that do.. That‚Äôs harassment. And then you're given bad performance rating for taking leave that you're entitled to.. >because that's what everyone else is doing

It's the kiasuism. For some people it begins from their school days. They find out that their grades are lagging behind their classmates' because they're all ""closet muggers"" who burn the midnight oil. Because I can't lose out to everyone else, I do the same.

We are so terrified of missing out on any potential benefit of doing what everyone else is doing, no matter how tiny or marginal.. Yea except that if no shit happen don't need to pack bag and wear no. 4. Your wages aren't as competitive compared to overseas either. That's the most shag part.. in my former company the guy who is considered the most hardworking and does the most work continues to receive most work.. I have made it very clear to my all my reports (including in SG) that I do not expect an answer outside business hours.

On the rare occasion that I do need them when they are off, I will write a text message *asking* if they have time. If they don't respond, or if they respond that they don't have time, that is completely ok.

However, I am not unfamiliar with differences in work culture and expectations, but in my opinion, it needs to change. I am not a fan of making laws - I am not French after all, but I still think it needs to change.

How is the union situation in Singapore? Any help from that side?. It absolutely is. The culture is so entrenched here, even here in Reddit you get posts about people worried their future will be ruined if they have to do an extra year in school or that their children will lose out if they go to a less prestigious school or have less tuition hours. It's ridiculous and so damaging to our overall well-being.. The worst thing is that some employers will try to convince you that you got ""above average market rate"" when sending a cursory question within your network yields a very different answer.

It's like they are filtering people who are smart on interviews but expecting them to be stupid.. there are two ways to increase profit. 

one is to be genuinely more competitive by offering a better product or service. this usually means more work for the workers. 

the other is to lower cost of production. this means cutting wages or firing people. 

you‚Äôll notice that either way of increasing profit fucks the worker. this is by design.

there is a mythical third way: ‚Äòbetter management‚Äô. this usually just translates into one of the previous two ways, but with more absurdity. everyone knows that the best way to get promoted is to manage upwards, which means fucking the downstairs. 

thank you capitalism!. Union? We have one called NTUC but not all jobs are unionised and they have been co-opted by the cooperations anyway and in some cases, due to the businesses they themselves run, engage in similar practices.. The only union we have in Singapore, most of us know it as a supermarket.. From what I know, most SGreans aren't aware of worker unions. We do have NTUC, but I'm not sure if they do have a role in worker protections.

I'm not too aware of any type of unionising either. When I started at my previous job, I wasn't briefed on any sort of union protection.. Yeah I can definitely agree with that.. SMEs tend to be the worst offenders on that front too.. what is wrong with you?

The way to be competitive is to add value of your product to people's lives.

Just one example: When they made the PC people thought it was useless and now we have it on our phone. Everyone and their moms (literally) have it.

This is why we thank Capitalism and not Communism.. So the culture is deeply ingrained.

That does indeed does make it hard to change.. i tried telling my employer that according to My Career Future website by salary is below average. guess what happened...

it got laughed off. who made the PC? the workers. 

specifically, the workers of the united states navy (if you‚Äôre talking about the first digital computer). 

something something profit motive?

the internet was also famously a department of defense project. in fact, virtually every aspect of the first iphone was based on government technology.

wtf do you know about capitalism? very little it seems.. Yep, it does.. What is your point here?

The workers got paid, the workers of the united states navy got paid, the point of being competitive is to get more resources which have thankfully been consolidated into one measuring unit: money so now we have a standard.

It is not yet perfected but it is better than bartering.

Why are you talking about the internet when we are talking about businesses and being competitive?

Whatever little I know about capitalism seems to be more than what you do.

Do you also happen to think that the Government is out to get you? Because ironically, history has shown that it is governments that label themselves Communist that has obsessively monitored their citizens.. imagine thinking we must necessarily go back to bartering under socialism lmao

why am i talking about the internet? mainly because it‚Äôs the last most innovative thing ever created, and it wasn‚Äôt created due to the profit motive under capitalism?",3069.0,14,1,1

Such a toxic culture where being capable is not being rewarded. This is precisely the reason why people leave.. Kinda hard to put into words. Basically how ""fake"" everything feels, lol (not really a SG-exclusive thing)

You're expected to wayang your work; you cant just quietly do every task you're given, or nobody will notice you (hence no promotion)

Lunch culture. Fuck off with the ""hey hey its lunch lets all go for lunch together and score some company social credit points!"" culture. Lunch time is my only personal quiet time during work and I don't want to be forced to spend it with the same people I see for the entire day.. The OT culture.. The over time.. Adopting western corporate best practices at a superficial level.

The amount of hierarchy and office politics.. It's impossible to take long periods of NPL (No pay leave). If you don't have a good reason to take NPL, there is no way it'd be granted. For fks sake, what happens if I want to do volunteer work in Africa for a month? Also, having to play office politics if you want to get promoted or rise up fast.. i hate it when my colleagues start to speak in mandarin and alienate other people who doesn't speak mandarin/ not good in it. I'm Chinese but my level is really subpar so i feel left out. I feel for my non-Chinese speaking colleagues who can't be part of the conversation. I did tell my chinese colleagues off before but they just brushed it off saying ""we do speak english!"". Face time. Finished your work for the day? Too bad, you still have to stay until 6 p.m.. Long work hours. There‚Äôs a reason why we work the most number of hours in the world. What about productivity?. I do marketing consulting. 

One of the things I come across on a regular basis is:-

It works, so don‚Äôt fix it. 

For a country that likes to pride itself in being innovative and forward looking, a ton of companies here are stuck in the past. 

Best of all. Want to change, but want to do it cheap. In the end the initial investment would save the company money in the long run, but everyone just wants short term benefits.. the fucking boot lickers.. I'm so glad i'm in a ""get in, do your stuff, get out"" place. I really hated the meetings, meeting to schedule a meeting, and meetings to get ready for the real meeting meeting.

The ""group lunch"" mentality is just too much for me. every extra person who comes along for lunch increases the amount of time needed exponentially. Just pack your own lunch and eat in the office. I'm pretty glad mine has a deliveroo culture, just order in, eat at your desk and be done.. Politics :(. Lunch culture

'Groups'

Speaking Chinese in meetings

Last min travel plans. Expecting to OT without pay. Work done? Nobody cares, sit till 6 pm. At my company, it's 7 pm and we start working at 8:30 am HAHA. Surprised nobody mentioned how the senior Management thinks they can just tell you to innovate and expect you to come up with results with a snap of their fingers when they don't even know how things really work.

To be fair, if you can really do it, then credit where credit is due, but this whole we must innovate bs is becoming like that annual nsf thing where we had to come up with suggestions on how to improve things in the army. 20000 soldiers only a handful of useful ideas and fewer still that were feasible. Then they want some kind of guarantee that the innovation will work.

If there were precedents for said innovation working, then it's learning best practices, not innovating. Innovating requires an understanding that there is inherent risk that cannot be mitigated because you are trying for the first fucking time. Whoever tells you to innovate and then expects you to come up with some perfect proposal needs to go govern themselves accordingly.. OT, and contacting employees regarding work through messages after working hours (including weekend). I hate that. I just want my peace on weekend and not read such messages even though I may not need to attend to them immediately.. Just curious, do literal 9 to 5 jobs still exist? By which I mean the official working hours are literally 9 to 5. I have no real office working experience, but form what I've seen government jobs have standard 8.30-6.30, so I am curious as to which magical fantasy world that ""9 to 5"" expression hails from.. People being productive 10% of the 9 to 5 hours, and watching K-drama or gossiping the other 90% of the time. 

Finishing work early cuz I actually work efficiently but being expected to stay around till 5 doing nothing. 

Rampant use of Chinese, rather than the one language everybody knows in a corporate setting. It's very alienating.. the trashy ass gang culture with a small fry dragging his posse around wrecking one company and then moving on to the next place to destroy whilst bringing all his garbage along with him.

oh also the ass kissing and the grand delusions of grandeur mixed with the myths of Singaporean exceptionalism. Senior management ass kissing. Limitations and backward thinking. The taiji masters are annoying. Actually, not too bad.

I realise there will be people dissing situations at work, and in some cases it may even be true. Just also remember our national sport is complaining.

I just wanted to put in a short counterpoint that I love the opportunity to be here, and very thankful for my work life.

As for unsolicited advice - I believe that rather than blaming others for your problems at work, try and see what you can do to cope. Find a way to chart out how you will respond to things at work, and plan ahead. Find people who will support you and build your own makan-kakis of allies.

Corporate people are people too ;). Upper management deciding to go the whole ""autonomous decision making"" route but not allowing us peons to have ownership of a project? What is the point then?. Whats worst is that the staff who has been in the company longer than you is the slack one, while you - the newer staff - is telling him/her what to do. managers who get a salary range befitting that of a manager, yet complain that they have so much more to do than an employee at executive level. I work in a co where senior roles have a white ceiling, and being in ops, if u are good at what u do, expect to be doing the same thing forever.. My work is 9am to 6pm. but in actual fact I'm working 9am to 2am with no OT which is why I'm leaving this shithole. insane long lunch breaks. overseas, people use their breaks just to have a quick sandwich. Here, we do our monthly shopping at ntuc or go bank or queue for bbt. Everything.. i hate how americans stuff their value systems and norms down everyone's throat when u work for an american company. And they will tell you that the additional work is good for you and vital for your personal growth.. Just a load of bullshit to me... the good ones either rise to the top or they leave, the ones that stay in one spot are usually worthless cannon fodder. Ns taught me this unfortunately... Corporate life is just like one big group project in uni. Have to accept some ppl are completely useless but be sure to block their ass from claiming credit for ur work.. The worst thing is when the slackers rise up faster than the capable ones because they know how to play the 'game'.. If you want something done,give it to the busiest person in your organisation

I think its a Pratchett quote. I could be wrong.. Ah I know what you mean. To me, work is just work. I get paid to do it. Delivering good work products is not enough, though, according to my manager, I must also 'be more positive' and 'enthusiastic'. Honestly. T_T. Lunch culture in my firm is toxic. Employees have their own closed lunch groups where no one else is allowed in.. Lunch culture is really the worst especially if your colleagues are the incompetent types who just want to get through each day by putting in the minimum amounts of effort( some don‚Äôt even do that).. I bring my own lunches most of the time and when questioned, I am honest with my answers (eg. Food in the CBD is expensive, I need to watch my food intake, etc). On the rare days that I do head out with them for lunch, it is usually on Spectator mode and play things down.. During my internship I ate lucnh with my colleagues on the first day and then da bao and went to toilet to eat for the rest of the days. On the lunch culture, jst reject them la. Not that difficult right. Reject them long enough they will not find you anymore. Interesting. Luckily my company dont have such lunch culture. We have lunch with whoever we want. 

Its the email culture that I dislike. If you never send any email, people will think you are not doing any work.. i think cus its hard to hire and train your replacement. and also what happens after you come back from NPL? your replacement ain't gonna leave.. Besides, Sabbatical are almost unheard of.. Yeah fuck chinese who prefer to speak ching chong man. We should really eliminate local language (chinese, tamil, etc) and stick to english only, seriously.. What is the normal schedule there? I always see people saying 6pm as quitting time, so 8-6 with one hour lunch so 9 hour days 45 hour weeks?. You're the one who chooses to stay. Deliveroo culture? Doesn‚Äôt that add up fast? Or do you guys pool to save costs?

My conclusion is that your company must pay quite well.... This. You can be in a tiny company and there is still politicking involved. Amazing how human nature has the need for dominance, regardless of surroundings.. Well said. I have a few friends who faced this too. What they did was to sign to another sim, and pass that number to their work contacts. During weekends or after working hours, switch that phone off/remove that sim card.

Works all the time.. That was probably when there was still the 5.5 day work week. Mon to fri 9-5 and sat mornings. When they changed to 5 days, 9-5 sounds better than 830-630 but it refers to the same hours.

Sounds logical to me but no idea how true it is.. i used to work at a place that was 9-6 four weekdays + 9-3 one weekend.. Agree on the Chinese thing although I'm Chinese.. The thing is, we don't have the option of going for short lunch break then end our day early.

Shouldn't it be that if the guy gets his stuff done he can do wtv he wants during his lunch?. That‚Äôs the thing. At every level I believe there are such people. The ones who really rise are the ones who sit back and let other people do their work.

Dumb people like me will do it because if their work are not done, your work cannot move forward or you feel like nothing is moving so you rather do it yourself since you know you can.. what the fuck?! eat in toilet? I hope you are joking. oof bro. just go ur desk eat ba... Uh what. Why though?. I don't think its as easy as it sounds. Colleagues could see you as 'new kid on the block' and you don't want to hang with them and they can make your working life hell till you quit. No go one. U dont go lunch people start bitching about u, say u antisocial say ur work performance sucks etc. I never lunched with my colleagues at my previous job (I was there for just over half a year). When I was fired for incompetence, my ex-boss told me I should've socialised more by lunching with the very people I didn't want to offend further with my social ineptitude.

So it's not an option.. I do reject them by usually bringing my own food. In my previous company, it wasn't realistically an option as pointed out by someone else.. For civil servants, that sounds about right. I'm in the private sector and work all day on Saturdays on alternate weeks, so I work 54 hours on a ""full"" week.. ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the one who chooses to work instead of starve to death‚Äô

the best thing about capitalism is that it managed to convince us that true freedom was listening to your boss or starving. Deliveroo so that you don't have to walk to the hawker or food place, queue, and can coordinate your work at the same time when your international colleagues are coming in through lunch, which although a bit more expensive, can save you ~1 hour a day.

Some places actually value your productivity, tho i've not seen that in Stat boards, Gov entities, GLCs, and SMEs.

FWIW i'm in a US based tech company that isn't the usual Big 4 :). > Surprised nobody mentioned how the senior Management thinks they can just tell you to innovate and expect you to come up with results with a snap of their fingers when they don't even know how things really work.
>

Not Singapore, but ran into this in a former workplace. There was this ""innovation contest"" and a huge push to file patents.


Won the ""innovation contest"" by looking at everything we did and filing separate ""innovative ideas"" of various permutations and combinations of possible feature improvements. I think my final count was ~53 (been a few years.) Second place was ~15. 


AFAIK none of the ideas were implemented. My senior manager got promoted, though, and liked me quite a bit :-P. during fasting month my HR told me ‚Äúhaha don‚Äôt think we will let you skip lunch (1h) and go home early hor!‚Äù even though i didn‚Äôt say anything. ya the office was like super small and its at Suntec so everywhere was crowded. > When I was fired for incompetence, 

So were you fired for incompetence or because you had no social capital?. Is this really the norm? So the MOM guidance of:  
   
If you work        	        Your contractual hours of work are  
5 days or less a week	        Up to 9 hours per day or 44 hours a week  
More than 5 days a week    Up to 8 hours a day or 44 hours a week  
**edit heres the link, I suck at formatting reddit posts.   **

Just goes out the window or doesn't matter? I know Singaporeans worked a lot, but 54 seems crazy even for some of the more demanding jobs I've worked here. Long term that has to kill productivity.... wait what, why did your senior manager get promoted when all the ideas were yours?. That is just insensitive.. Yo, that's fucked up. i think its more of being likable so your colleagues can cover your ass. i have seen many cases already.. AFAIK those guidelines are only for blue-collar workers and white-collar workers up to a certain salary cap. If you earn more than that, you're at the mercy of your employer..

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî In a second such decision in recent months, the High Court has overturned the conviction of a doctor who pleaded guilty before a disciplinary tribunal to committing medical misconduct.

> Three appeal judges ruled in a 44-page written judgment released on Friday (Oct 18) that the charge against Dr Soo Shuenn Chiang, a psychiatrist at the National University Hospital (NUH) for failing to maintain his patient‚Äôs medical confidentiality was not made out.¬†

> The psychiatrist had been fined S$50,000 earlier this year by the Singapore Medical Council‚Äôs (SMC) tribunal for not verifying a caller‚Äôs identity and sharing confidential information about a patient‚Äôs condition with her brother, who had posed as her husband.

> The medical watchdog eventually applied to the courts to quash the conviction.¬†

> Dr Soo ‚Äî the director of the neuroscience clinic at NUH ‚Äî had not appealed against the fine, which was higher than what he or the SMC asked for.¬†

> In July, the High Court similarly reversed the conviction of an orthopaedic surgeon and called it a ‚Äúmiscarriage of justice‚Äù, noting that departing from acceptable medical standards of conduct does not always amount to professional misconduct.

> Dr Lim Lian Arn had been fined the maximum S$100,000¬†for failing to inform a patient of the risks or complications that could arise from a steroid injection to her wrist.¬†

> DR SOO WAS ‚ÄòUNDULY KEEN‚Äô TO MOVE ON

> In the court‚Äôs judgment on Friday, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said that doctors can provide a patient‚Äôs confidential medical information to those closest to the patient, such as their family, without their consent when:

> 

> They reasonably regard it as necessary to protect the patient from potentially serious self-harm.

> It is in the patient‚Äôs best interests to disclose the information.

> The patient‚Äôs consent cannot reasonably be obtained.

> 

> Among other points, the Chief Justice pointed out that Dr Soo seemed ‚Äúunduly keen‚Äù to move on and warned doctors that they are responsible for looking after their own interests.

> The judges raised this point as Dr Soo‚Äôs case had caused an outcry in the medical community.

> Online petitions were made to protest against the penalty, which was seen as being overly harsh.

> Chief Justice Menon said: ‚ÄúDr Soo could have contested the case on liability, and subsequently, even after pleading guilty to the charge, he could have appealed against at least the sentence imposed on him, but he chose to do neither.¬†

> ‚ÄúIt is not unreasonable in such circumstances to hold that he ought to lie on the bed that he has chosen to make for himself.‚Äù

> WHAT THE CASE IS ABOUT

> Dr Soo‚Äôs patient was admitted to NUH in January 2015 after a drug overdose.¬†

> Dr Soo noted that she had a history of depression and was at risk of harming herself.

> In March, the patient‚Äôs brother ‚Äî posing as her husband ‚Äî contacted Dr Soo, telling him that she was suicidal and needed to be taken to the Institute of Mental Health.¬†

> The caller was able to provide the patient‚Äôs name, medical history and identification number.

> Dr Soo issued a memo to refer the patient to IMH and passed it to his clinic staff to give to the patient‚Äôs family.¬†

> The brother later used that memo to successfully get a personal protection order against the patient. He had earlier applied to the Family Court on behalf of the patient‚Äôs son for the order.

> The patient then filed a complaint with the SMC. It is not known if the patient was eventually referred to IMH.¬†

> On March 14 this year, the SMC applied to the High Court for an extension of time to appeal for a reduction of the fine imposed by the tribunal on Dr Soo.

> After that, the patient‚Äôs brother wrote on Facebook that while he was the man who had spoken to Dr Soo but he had done so with the patient‚Äôs husband‚Äôs consent.¬†

> The SMC approached both the brother and husband to take statements from them which were not recorded before the patient‚Äôs complaint was referred to the disciplinary tribunal.¬†

> As their accounts differed from the facts that Dr Soo pleaded guilty to, the SMC applied to overturn the conviction and sentence.

> ACCEPTED EXPERT‚ÄôS REPORT

> The three judges disregarded the brother‚Äôs and husband‚Äôs accounts as they were not satisfied that they were reliable.

> They also called for a medical expert, Dr Daniel Fung from IMH, to give a supplementary report. Dr Fung had earlier told the SMC‚Äôs disciplinary tribunal that Dr Soo did not verify the caller‚Äôs identity and thus breached medical confidentiality.

> But after reading a letter from Dr Soo containing more details of the circumstances under which he prepared his memo, Dr Fung stated that in actual fact, Dr Soo had not breached confidentiality.

> Chief Justice Menon noted that the facts in Dr Soo‚Äôs letter would have been revealed earlier if he had ‚Äúnot been so keen to put this matter behind him regardless of the cost to him and, it seems, to the medical profession‚Äù.

> The judges also accepted Dr Fung‚Äôs opinion that when Dr Soo received the call, he had ‚Äúgood reason‚Äù to find a real risk of suicide in light of the patient‚Äôs past medical and psychiatric history.

> It was also appropriate for Dr Soo to give her family members the memo as he wanted the police or ambulance staff to quickly take the patient to IMH, the judges said.

> Dr Fung had noted that Dr Soo also gave specific instructions to his staff to hand over the memo to the patient‚Äôs husband and the staff should have been responsible for verifying the identity of the person collecting it.

> As for verifying the caller‚Äôs identity, the judges said that it ‚Äúwould seem contrary to good sense, even common sense‚Äù for Dr Soo to directly call the patient to do so.¬†

> This was because the caller was giving information suggesting that the patient would mortally injure herself.

> ‚ÄúIn our judgment, what Dr Soo did was precisely what was called for in the circumstances,‚Äù they added.

> WORKGROUP SET UP¬†

> The two controversial disciplinary tribunal rulings on Dr Soo and Dr Lim led the Ministry of Health (MOH) to set up a 12-member workgroup to review two issues.¬†

> The workgroup will look into the issues of the taking of patients‚Äô informed consent by doctors, as well as the disciplinary process of the SMC.¬†

> On the taking of informed consent from patients, the workgroup will provide recommendations on the practical steps and any ethical and/or legal standards expected of medical practitioners doing so.

> It will also review and give recommendations on the SMC‚Äôs disciplinary process, including how complaints are considered and how disciplinary tribunal proceedings are conducted.

> The workgroup, which put out some interim recommendations in September,¬†will continue to consult the medical profession on these preliminary ideas and put forth its final recommendations to the MOH for review at the end of this year.

No lah I want to be a convict. [deleted]. Hah. Studying for a degree in Translation & PolSci.

*Need to study meh? I can say English and Chinese also what. You think I can become translator also?*

*My company we all can speak English and Chinese can do liaison with clients [note: pronounced by them as 'clints'] from USA and China already.*

So much more goes into translation but there's this general misconception globally that being semi-fluent in both languages is passable for a professional setting.. Engineering: The final reasonable option for those who can't become a doctor, lawyer, or banker.. ITE so your usual stuff..

Ppl were like, oh can help me repair my computer?

And the usual ITE discrimination.. Gonna major in creative writing.

""So ur gonna be a teacher after u graduate?""

Common question asked by patients in hospital. Actually, food science undergrad do conduct food tasting or sensory evaluation in school on a regular basis. when they graduate to work in a food company, they also need to do food tasting for market research too. If you are good in what you do, yes. Avg pay is 3k to 4k, higher demand skill will be slightly higher. 

Source: am a engineer myself. >Economics : ""Oh cus you were rejected by business school?""

Isn't econs a harder course than business? Business is a ""soft"" course while econs is one of the more difficult social sciences.. Oh you try saying one of the more esoteric disciplines, or the obscure Area Studies degrees.

Literally watch people's face go into BSOD when you tell them you're doing Southeast Asian studies. Combine with Windows shutdown sound for greater effect.. As an Econs major I AGREE WITH THIS.. > Psychology

‚ÄúWHY IS AH MA DEPRESSED? THE PSYCHIATRIST ALREADY GAVE HER PILLS BUT SHE STILL DEPRESSED, HOW?‚Äù bruh firstly psychologists don‚Äôt even prescribe meds, secondly i‚Äôm still in uni what makes you think i know more than a trained psychiatrist (and clinical psych isn‚Äôt the only field in psych!). There is a nobel prize for Economic but not for Business studies. Why is that? People who runs MOF, MAS, World Bank, IMF are generally all Economists but no-one with  Business studies etc. Why is that?  PSC sends our scholars to study economics to the best Universities in the World and not Business Studies. Why is that? The next PM and current Minister of Finance has Economics but not Business Studies. Why is that? Goh Chok Tong, our 2nd PM has an Economics Masters but no business studies. Why is that ?. Not be discouraging but law has a very high barrier to entry. The 10th percentile of law students have a perfect grade of AAAA for A levels. So firstly you need to have very good grades in JC for them to consider you. Next if you get chosen out of the hundreds maybe even thousands of people who apply every year, you have to go through an interview and you have to pass that interview to get into law school.. You could also look into the various foundation courses for overseas unis in the UK for law. 

It would allow you to skip a levels entirely and go straight into uni. Google ‚Äúbellerbys‚Äù and ‚Äúinto programmes‚Äù.. Remember to sell your peaches on the side and get featured in local publications (not for your peaches, but for your face). Escort?. There's no math required here(biggest blessing because I still count with my fingers) and I'm a big fish in a small pond so I'm doing quite well. Should be able to make it to poly smoothly.. No, and I can't seem to find any info on where to go for a screening in SG. Not surprised when we're all expected to be math geniuses. It's not from me not trying enough definitely. Most of the time I focused on math, even with tuition it didn't  improve. It's like my brain just goes full retard when it sees numbers. On the other hand I'm extremely adept at humanities and languages.. my parents(luckily) weren't like that. I guess they are just unaware of the partisan hysteria and stereotyping of left wing students. In SG it's not really that bad, most young people are socially liberal anyway.. Yes, i hear dancing for lesbians pays well. O7 fellow comrade.. Marie Kondo for Docker. Also have. The exams are set by LSE if you study in SIM-UOL. That's why people jokingly call it LSE Clementi.. We're talking about pure sciences like biological sciences. To some extent, it's true that grads of pure science subjects would have difficulty finding jobs unless they're willing to do something completely unrelated (e.g. HR, Operations). If they want a possible research career in the field they're studying, then they have to do a PhD. Even then, the market for science researchers in Singapore is really tiny.. You misread.. he's saying repairing computers AND the ITE discrimination. They're separate.. Lol they think it's a one size fits all kinda thing, as long as engineering or electronic/electrical can do everything.......  Hi able, I'm Dad!. u can pm me for more info :).

How‚Äôs the stress level as an engineer at your company ? Do you work in a 24/7 manufacturing firm where you have to support the operation even after office hour ?. That honestly seems so little for the job you do. I'm an O&G process tech and I earn nearing 4k after 5 year experience with my diploma (that's with a bad start with being paid under the market rate for 4 years)

Edit: Just saw that you just started working.. Business may be an easier subject but it's harder to get in because of the demand.. Definitely. The mathematics involved is mind boggling. He clearly has no clue what the discipline is about.. If u can understand math. You can understand most things.. >There is a nobel prize for Economic but not for Business studies.

There's no Nobel Prize for business because business is not even a coherent academic discipline. Most business courses are a mishmash of finance, basic accounting, HR, marketing, and logistics or supply chain stuff.

Its a course promoted by our government in the 80s and 90s to produce white collar workers/employees. not an intellectual discipline.. Then why people need to get MBA, not MA Econs?

Wham bam check*mate* exit stage left. And don't forget the bar exams...headache on it's own. ah thank u sm !!. Escort.. You need to work on your math. Gonna be a pain in the ass in poly. dyscalculia isnt very well-known or well-studied. you can get an assessment done by the [Dyslexia Association of Singapore]( as they also cover dyscalculia. not sure about the cost.

you might also be interested in r/dyscalculia. You have brought that to my attention. Thank you!. But think of the exposure. 500 exposure buck.. Because other people might thought that food science students do not do food tasting?. Mae. I just started so cant comment much. The people around me are busy haha.. OT is quite common.... What does a O&G process tech do?. The high demand actually reveals how rote and unimaginative our Singapore system and our industries are. Every kid and their mother wants a place in ""business"" because they hope to work in a corporate or a bank. Actually, you don't need a business degree to get a job at these places.

The fact is that the business degree is a rojak of various subjects. Originating from the UK but most popular in Australia (as the BComm). Its hardly even offered in the UK now or US at the undergrad level, where you can get hired at a financial institution with a general arts degree. Business would be seen as some sort of ""Mickey Mouse"" degree course

There's a reason why there are Nobel Prizes for Economics, but no Nobel Prizes for HR or marketing.. MBA is a professional course for midlevel executives and managers dude. Hardly the next Thomas Pikettys in the making.

Plus its well known that MBA is a money-sucking scheme for business schools worldwide. People generally go there to network, not to study.

The real braniacs go on to get their PhD in Econs. There are hardly any doctoral programmes in Business because it is not even a coherent intellectual discipline. At most, management, but ask an economist post-doc what you think of his PhD colleague in Management and he will probably laugh.. He asked about what he needed to do to ""get there"". What to do to get out is a whole nother story haha. And finding training contracts. I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs becoming a larger pain in the ass.. However, if you‚Äôre a dude, NS might be a problem.. How u know leh. Even in business courses? Don't plan on going engineering at all.. üòÇ. Let's be fair though, we don't do that much food tasting as you make it sound like in school. Idk about all the other unis popping up with food science courses, but at least when I was in NUS we had just a single module in sensory, and apart from that and our NPD in year 3 we've never had any other food tasting in our regular curriculum. Can't exactly call that regulat

I did enjoy the mods where we experimented on food though. Our parents always told us not to play with our food, now we are officially allowed to do so.. Same, may i know more about the future career potentials for mae?. Crude oil into petrol/diesel. Oil and gas.

Hired a few before. During chatting and dinner they talked about their job without specifics. No disrespect, after all if you‚Äôre chiobu why not earn some good money when you‚Äôre young? Maybe even pick up some connections while you‚Äôre at it.. Yes, math is still needed in some modules eg accounting, econs and stuff. You should have a basic understanding of stats at least which is applied maths. It‚Äôs needed in all aspects of life for proper decision making.. not sure about poly, but in uni, business courses still require you to take a few accounting & economics modules. also obviously finance involves math.. Hmmm generally you can join alot of companies haha. Alot will go into semicon industry and ST.. Mother tongue doesn't matter, I failed higher Chinese and still made it to njc. You can do it, it's not as hard as you think. Just do your best.. Then go for it. 

However, you should go intern at a firm before you really commit. Last I checked, getting called to the bar is now longer smooth sailing after law school and practice life issnt all that hunky dory.. Oh I'm fine with that. Just don't ask me to ""find x"".. hmm i‚Äôm failing regular chinese tho :( but thank u, i‚Äôll definitely try my best. i see, thank u for the advice :). Business mods requires you to find it. All of them have accounting and statistical theory which requires you to plot graphs and do equations etc. But on the bright side, it's not that tough if you follow up on all your tutorials..

123,PSA: FYI tomorrow is the last day to catch a glimpse of the Merlion at Sentosa before it gets demolished.,dk0kiu,2019-10-19 07:37:09,"It's sad that there isn't much opposition to it, and more so because its a private affair rather than a public issue.

Oh well, if you wanna catch one last look at the Merlion, tomorrow is your final chance.",61,0.86,36.0,"Went last Sunday, no queue at all. Totally understood the decision to tear it down. It was so different from the scary place I remembered it as being during my childhood.
 
Its a shell of its former self. On the first floor its basically a little museum showing the PR origins of the Merlion and a little gift shop. On top is a open air viewing area for photo taking, as well as a photo opportunity at the Merlion mouth, where you can ring a super loud bell. I really pity the photographer who has to listen to the bell right beside her/him as it gets struck every couple seconds.

The Sentosa Merlion is a shell of its former self. I was sad to see it go before, but now I can see why its going away...It really just doesn't spark joy anymore.. Real talk for those who are sad it‚Äôs getting demolished though- how many times have you actually visited it in the last 5 years?. 90% of these visitors wouldn't ever go to sentosa just to see the merlion in their life if it wasn't getting demolished.. Why should there be? It is an artificial construct with little architectural value, design and build for sole pulling in the tourist dollar. Raze it to the ground!. Thanks for the heads up. I renovated the cafe at ground floor a couple years back. Hope it gave everyone some good times there.. But its just the sentosa one right??? It aint the original one or anything so why B upset?. good riddance!. [Good night sweet prince. ]( sHIT I forgot about that ;( it's so sad. Who cares, literally hvnt seen it for donkey years. Post some pics. Way not Just put it on top of Singapore Mount Faber Park like what Rio De Janeiro did with Statue Of Christ The Redeemer to have a nice hight view of parts of Singapore from on top of the Sentosa Merlion at the top of Mount Faber Park and Mount Faber Park can get another 37 Metres (121.391 Foot) to it.. Who‚Äôs here is it recurring customer?  
I believe this goes for 99% of all tourists.. Omigosh! I'll have to rush down to see it!!. Omg I remember shitting my pants inside that volcano place thing as a kid (was it a volcano?) Went back today and it‚Äôs just a series of multimedia displays and info cards that look more like one of them government backed exhibitions. Too sterile for the normal price. Bring back the scary!. is there an entry fee?. This does not spark joy.

Kinda disappointed I didn't have this kind of experiences back when I was a kid. I did not visit it in the last 15 years. I did not get a chance to visit it or go on top of it not even ones, not in my primary school days, not in my secondary school days, not in my ITE school days, because the primary school I was in always bring student to Jurong Frog Farm, Kompong Glam and Singapore Zoo and the secondary school I was in always bring studens to Kranji War Menorial evey year and in ITE very little field trip, most of the time will be in the school class room.

But I was thinking of going there with my father tomorrow and go on top of the 37 Meters Tall (121.391 Foot Tall) Sentosa Merlion for the First Time and Last Time on the Last Day to take as many pitch as I can with my phone before it get Demolished üòêüòüüò¶üò¢üò£üò≠.

(RIP) Rest In Pieces To Singapore Tallest Merlion, The 37 Meters Tall (121.391 Foot Tall) Sentosa Merlion üò≠üò≠.. Never visited ever.. Still planning to visit it.. Recently pass by on monorail nia. I feel like most tourists know the Merlion Park one more than this chonky boi tho. Yes.   


Cause its still an icon, getting replaced by 'another garden'

Also its the only one where you can go all the way up. IMO its alot more impressive because of the size, over the other one vomiting water.. Probably can't due to flight restrictions. It is Oh My Gosh or OMG for short not Omigosh.. Volcanoland! I remembered having to take an elevator which gave young me the impression that I was really going down into the depths of the volcano.. Shiet, its more than 15 years for me, unker liao.. Wtf Kurt is that u?. Cos a lot of people wanna take Insta photos of the Merlion spitting water into their mouths.

One guy did it once on Instagram, cue everyone else.. Mate to be fair in The rest of the world Singapore is known as a huge garden and since its not the original, im guessing thats why there was No opposition to it.. But Singapore Mount Faber Park is only 94 Metrs Tall (308.399 Foot Tall) not as high as Singapore Only Highest Hill ""The Bukit Timah Hill"" at 163.63 Metres Tall (538.843832 Foot Tall), if you put the 37 Metres Tall (121.391 Foot Tall) Sentosa Merlion on top of Bukit Timah Hill you will get 200.63 Metres Tall (658.234908 Foot Tall) and if you put the 37 Metres Tall (121.391 Foot Tall) Sentosa Merlion on top of Mount Faber Park you will get 131 Metres Tall (429.79 Foot Tall).

All Plans big and small need to fly over tall montains and tall building and big statue so that the planes big and small wont crash into the montains, the buildings and the big statue, so it is safe to put the 37 Metres Tall (121.391 Foot Tall) Sentosa Merlion on top of Mount Faber Park.. OMG yes!!! That place was the stuff of the nineties. Can still rmb my mom scolding me for freaking out at the display hahaha.. As much as me and anyone else is aware of that, I think we have plenty. The renders don't look particularly unique to the ones I've seen in gardens by the bay, hence I don't think its anything special having another garden (of course renders are not always final). Did any one got the chance to watch the Sentosa Merlion Light Show?? This is a 07 minutes and 36 seconds SG 50 Light Show Video  and a 15 minutes and 49 seconds Magic Lights Video  and a 15 mins 46 seconds This Year SG 54 Magic Lights Video  That was also the time when Sentosa had a kickass water park named Fantasy Island..

What's the cost of owning a car in Singapore? How easy is it to live without a car?

What other the major costs should I think about before moving to Singapore?",8,0.6,21.0,"Greetings fellow tech bro,

I did something similar to you, but took a higher paying job to come here. You might have fun taking a lateral position here, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if your long-term goal is to save money.

That said, there are three things that would probably be more expensive than where you‚Äôre at:
Rent, car and alcohol.

Rent is extremely expensive in the downtown area where your office is located: think San Fran-type pricing for studios and flats. Download the PropertyGuru app to check rentals in the area. You can save money by living in a government-owned project ‚ÄúHDB‚Äù but you will likely prefer a condo, which refers to a privately-owned property here in Singapore.

You 100% do not want a car unless you‚Äôre making it rain. You‚Äôre better off living next to a train station (aka MRT station) or just taking taxis/rideshares, which will feel dirt cheap coming from the US.

Alcohol is heavily taxed by the government, so a beer at a Western-style bar or club will cost in the USD 7~15 range. USD 15 is pretty standard for a cocktail or mixed beverage as well. I pretty much quit drinking when I got here because of it.

Food is cheap if you eat local food and expensive if you don‚Äôt. A local dish can be 2-3 USD while a fancy Western dish could be 20+. Note, there is no tipping in Asia so restaurant dining is still generally cheaper unless you have expensive tastes.

Anyway, if you can swallow the rent and not live like a rockstar daily/aren‚Äôt an alcoholic, you can save money and have a lot of fun! Good luck.. I work there. You don‚Äôt have to live in the city where rent is expensive and apartments are small af. 

Check outside the CBD and get a spacious place for 1.5-2.5k. 

Don‚Äôt own a car, grab instead. It‚Äôs cheap enough even if you spend 1k a month on it. A car is gonna run you way more than that after you count in gas, road tax, maintenance and insurance.. You don‚Äôt need a car at all, public transport is so cheap and the best in the world. And you have taxis which are cheap enough.. - This is the area you are looking at... 

- Public transport is good enough. Taxis are cheap. Don‚Äôt get a car.

- Major expense would be on rent, expensive buys, alcohol, clubbing/partying and taking the girls out. Everything else is pretty inexpensive.


BTW Marina One also has residential so you could look that up. I would suggest living at the River Valley or Robertson Quay area which are two stops away.. If you're single and earning $4,000/mth and above it's a pretty comfortable life. Most people take public transport as cars are prohibitively expensive here. Calling a taxi often is still cheaper than car ownership.. Hope it‚Äôs not a job where you have to use a computer connected to the internet. On the off chance that you have a motorcycle license, owning a motorcycle is an order of magnitude cheaper than owning a car.. Cost of a car;


Cost of an apartment for a foreigner;
At least $2,000-3000 per month for a one bed, which is about 30 mins away, if you wanna live closer.....around $4,000 minimum for something tiny around marina bay sands.

Other costs;
Alcohol is expensive
Food/vegetables/meat is very expensive. Rent is around $3-4K per month. Transportation is very get expensive. You won‚Äôt able to eat on the restaurant is too expensive. Suggest you don‚Äôt work in Singapore. Try Australia where work life balance is better. We don‚Äôt have tipping culture but restaurants usually charge 10% service charge. Hi! If you don't mind my asking, which company are you working in?. 1 bedroom can be rented for around $3700/month in the property FB is in.

Source:  foods can be very cheap. I forgot to ask this but how inconvenient would it be to not have a car?. Not very. Public transport is affordable and accessible. Else, there are also taxis and Grab car which isn't very very expensive.. consider a bike, if you own a bike license.. Public transport is affordable but it‚Äôs really crowded and MRT trains often breaks down. Actually recently the breakdowns less already. And honestly, compared to New York or UK Underground, our breakdown rates are considered low already. Don't undersell us to foreigners.. You are probably a driving your own car. Try taking public transport Everyday. It‚Äôs sardine pack. Are you a property owner? I know how you feel, you probably have no one to rent your apartment right? Try harder.. Lol no I'm not. I'm just a regular salaryman. I'm not discounting the crowdedness. I'm saying don't undersell what we have. Very good already (of course, can be better la).

Addendum: I just saw your 2nd point about property. Huh? Why the topic suddenly change to property owner? I'm confused. I'm just trying to be nice and advise a foreigner visitor.

126,What do non-socially awkward (unlike me) teenagers in Singapore normally do on weekends?,dk09v1,2019-10-19 07:00:27,"I guess most of them go to club and stuff. Anything else?
:)",66,0.85,69.0,"I just stay at home. Meet friends, go to a park, swimming pool, gym maybe? Bars, restaurants, bistros, volunteer events, part time jobs. Mugging for exams. Perhaps u mean young adult?. Some like to go cafe-hopping and eat desserts.. Go Aljunied with some friends üòèüòè. The answers you got here are pretty good but i laughed at you asking reddit, the gsthering place of all the socially awkward people. a hobby is definitely worth picking up! You can try tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons!! you can register for beginner dnd on [Warhorn]( . I personally used to go to the games organised in Pi. 

There‚Äôs also [meetup.com](meetup.com) where you can find groups of people with common interests or pick up new skills (like python!). 

Also, this might just be me talking to much, but smile more often!! it makes u more friendly, people will be more inclined to respond 

Jiayous fellow socially awkward!. Gym, meet friends for makan and lepak, movies, shopping.. I just stay at home and sleep/do assignments because i'm too lazy :)
    
Or part time jobs if I have one at the time, or cycling/skating with my friends if our schedules align. I'm a (hopefully not socially awkward) poor student who has no money to go clubbing or go restaurants every week... I dunno about non-socially awkward but I go help out at the church garden, volunteer to teach a class on programming and play volleyball with a random group of guys online

Surprisingly good ways to meet new people especially the regulars. 

Good way to start might be volunteering at the willing hearts soup kitchen. If you go regularly you're bound to get noticed/to notice other regulars. Just walk in literally any day any time up to 5pm, no need advance notice nor skills. Dude only for 2 years (18, 19) of your teen years can you get into clubs. You must be totally deluded if you think literally every single one of the ""cool kids"" are hitting the clubs every weekend.. [meetup.com](, lots of stuff out there to cater to different hobbies or even to find new hobbies. Most things are free or very low cost, easy way to meet people or find others that have interests in things that your immediate friends might not have.. Sports. Volleyball and Frisbee. Started as a hobby, became my salvation. try cooking. I mean i dont think im socially awkward but if you're looking for things to do alone you could go play a sport with random ppl at a CC/ public court. My sport of choice is basketball and you'll be surprised how welcoming people can be to newbies at your local court. If you want something you can truly do alone fishing is a good choice for enjoying the soltitude and the learning curve is not too steep with lots of instructional videos on youtube. That being said the gear is a tad expensibe if you get it first hand but decathlon has budget rods and reels for beginners. Im no expert on fishing and I've met redditors with youtibe channels dedicated to SG fishing but HMU if you want to know more.. Pick up new hobbies! I do sports and go for classes so that‚Äôs a great place to meet new people and make new friends.
Try something new, like to go to a museum or an art exhibition. There‚Äôs a lot to do out there if you search for it, there are many events almost every weekend, and you can check out Timeout or other events listing pages for fun things to do. They work.. Volunteer.. From insta, most of them eat out w friends, and those who do sports work out. Are you asking this for research or to get ideas what to do? There are a few groups on meetup to meet new friends if that is what you are looking for.. Stay at home and study. Reddit, HWZ, STOMP ... in decreasing order of boredom. CS with friends, all my friends not that social either.. I usually dig my nose, then quite engross in it. Before I know, half the day past liao. Then beside me a lot of pisai. Good thing is got 24/7 fresh air.. I play basketball with some friends. Or maybe lunc/dinner with other friends. Or maybe chill at home, play some games with some friends. Depends.. Well as a 14 year old, i just invite my friends to go swim and just have lunch after that. I also play video games because who doesn't.. do homework duh. Osu! Multiplayer with friends...lol

Edit: Bowling is fun too! Can be absolute shit and still have fun.. Lazada , Taobao , Carousell , Shopee , Instagram , Facebook , Netflix .. They might not be here on reddit lol
We are all here for a reason. There's club activities like tabletop games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the Gathering and Warhammer.

Others do group sports like football, basketball or dragonboating.

The one activity I can't stand, that I see many young women do, is cafe hopping.. Stay at home and read books. Last time no YouTube, so read alot of books. Now got YouTube, netflix etc. More content to binge watch at home. 

Previously my mum was concerned that I was spending too much time at home. Now got gf, she's concerned that I'm not spending enough time at home.. HAHAHA honestly, have been in Singapore for the last 18 years in my life and felt like 90% of my weekends have been spent mugging. If I had the choice though, I would honestly like to spend more time with my parents/extended family. Also I really like reading too - honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind spending the entire day at NLB. for me, serving ns and only can off every weekend. I would spend time at arcade with regulars, i play maimai and taiko.

i recently thinking to rent studio or jam out in public. mood. Same la bro, now mugging season. HAHAHHAA TEA. ...and fap? 

LOL. Lol. Yeah same here , stay home play dota with friends. I‚Äôll go out maybe twice a month with friends for dinner and or a movie but thats about it.... Hmm thanks for the ideas! But don‚Äôt people normally do these with existing friends?

Like for me, I usually run or go to the gym alone, but other people I see in parks are usually there with their friends. 

How do I make NEW friends here though?

 (Sorry if this sounds dumb, spending my entire life mugging or doing academic/career related stuff has made me pretty socially inept and anxious (though I‚Äôve always really wanted to socialize)). Yeah. Thankss!. *Me and the boys campaigning for reelection at Aljunied GRC*. How's the dnd on Warhorn like ah? I don't get it, it seems that someone will offer to gm, then people just join. But is it a one-shot adventure? If not, do people arrange to meet again to continue a campaign? I'd assume you're expected to at least have dice and a character sheet, but do we pre-plan a character with the gm in advance? What about minis? Do we need our own? Argh.. I wanted to give it a go, but I had a thousand questions... Haha yeah thankss! Actually I just installed Meetup.com last week, I‚Äôll give it a go!. To get ideas lmao. cs?. ok. What the fuck? U a psychic or some shit? How do you know!?. Same bro. I dont usually go out since im usually physically tired or lasy. What are you interested in? You have a hobby? I used to go out alone all the time when I was 16 fo 18 hears old. Easiest way to make friends is in school/work/common-interest. You can volunteer for some causes that you like, find out where people with similar hobbies as you gather. For me I just got hooked on gaming (Dota2) while I was feeling lonely. It was my hobby. Made some friends there after a few months and found that we all stay in Singapore. 2 months later we arranged to meet up at a local dota 2 event and suddenly I gained 4, 5, 6 friends. One of them ended up becoming my boyfriend as well. So I suggest - look at what your interest are, go out, go online, wherever, go and talk to these people. Meet them someday. Im sure you will gain a few friends this way gradually. Best part is that you will always have many things to talk about.. I actually made friends through mobile games / online games  


Helps that i try to find guilds/clans that are SG players only. hey, i can relate to your situation quite well. my whole life up until jc I was really bad in social situations, probably because my entire childhood and adolescent years were spent pretty much solely on acads. jc was a turning point for me, where i stepped out of my comfort zone joining a few events and camps here and there + learning how to talk to girls (was from an all-boys sch). 

ns right now is when i felt ive really boosted my social skills, meeting lots of new friends and whatnot. all i can say is, if you want to improve ur social skills, you have to get uncomfortable. you will inevitably make mistakes along the way, e.g cringe moments that i still ocassionally look back on, but over time it becomes second nature.. Pricey to keep going to cafes though.. counter-strike. OP said the magic word ""teenager""


So, what prize did I win for guessing correctly?. >Be girl gamer

>Have (possibly desperate bbfa gamer) guys try to hook up with you the moment they find out you‚Äôre a girl in-game

I‚Äôm not saying this happened to OP, but you were definitely lucky to meet someone who wasn‚Äôt *that* type. Shoot arrow hit arrow

I second the dota 2 thing, half of my rl friends are thanks to dota lol. Wow that‚Äôs nice! I‚Äôm not really into phone games though but I like fitness and reading books!

You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôll try to find people who like to read. It‚Äôs just hard to actually talk to them cuz it might look really weird.. Cheaper than going to clubs and stuff, I'd reckon.. You get an upvote. Egirl life best life sia. Mai tu liao faster set up patreon account and sell nudes. Me too bro omg.. That's good, maybe you can post in the subreddits of reading and fitness to look for people in your area. You can take part in organised running events, join a sport CCA in school if you are studying.. Check out some independent bookstores, they regularly hold events and talks around books which might be fun to attend. Thank you. Have an upvote on me.. Just sell bathwater can liao.. bro üòéüí™.

127,Can anyone enlighten me on why the pricing for the Pixel 4 is cheaper in SG compared to the iPhone 11 when the launch price for the Pixel 4 is USD100 more than the iPhone 11?,djz88i,2019-10-19 04:58:29,"&#x200B;

[Lauch price for Pixel 4 is USD799 and iPhone 11 is USD699, but in Sg the Pixel is cheaper than the iPhone?](",34,0.84,27.0,"It's not popular here, and starhub is the only Telco which carries it. I'm gonna buy the XL myself.. Can someone explain to me why the Pixel 3 is more expensive than the Pixel 4!?!?!?!. Prices are different across regions. Usually not by a lot, but even +-$100 is possible. Just depends on supply and demand.. Google announced Pixel 4 release date and price. When Apple shortly after announced iPhone 11 prices, Google immediately announced a price revision undercutting both the iPhone 11 competition models. 

Nearly all smartphone model pricing are pegged to iPhone prices for yonks.. Because apple knows they can sell at premium and people will still buy, even if the base model is priced at 1999, there will still be long queues for it. You'd be crazy to get the pixel 4. Because of Trump's Made-In-China tariff. Apple was willing to bite the bullet and subsidise the cost for US Customers (since 65% of iPhone's price is pure profit), but not Google.. Out of curiosity: Are you a longtime pixel/google ecosystem user? 

I was hyped for the Pixel announcement, but I can't justify the price tag of the Pixel 4, XL or otherwise - doesn't seem to have either topend specs or QOL functions that I'd splurge on. I think it might have something to do with what r/Bayesian01 mentioned about a price revision.. still trying to find the source.. Because Apple and Google are both pricing their phones lower this year for better affordability. Isn't that good news?
Also Google chose to not include earphones and not have every single underused hardware feature crammed into the phone. I like the strategy. This is probably the real answer but that just makes me feel that Apple only priced it at $699 for the US market and left the price as usual in their other markets.. Where can I find info about this price revision? I have only seen the price to be USD799 for the Pixel 4 64GB. Nonsense. Those were misleading rumours / leaks. There was no price change.. Funny this comment comes after they dropped the price of the 11 compared to the XR. Shh, you're disturbing the sheep.. Yea.. but we don't have sanctions here but the iPhone here is more expensive than the pixel which irks me.. Thats my first thought when they announced the price.. we know iphones are over priced and apple reacted by reducing its price by USD100, but specs wise, its so hard to justify the price of the pixel 4 when oneplus 7T pro as convoluted as it might be is much more compelling priced at S$1188 currently for pre-order on Lazada: []( No actually i used to have iPhone 7 plus, but it malfunctioned after 2.5 years, so i decided to get the 3a XL(thats the only one i could afford with my budget, only  ¬£ 200 where i bought it after i trade in my iPhone). It's not astronomically fast but good enough for daily use(social media, emails etc). Never used their home mini or nest mini, but am considering getting those this time, there's this promo going on in their SG store, which includes the nest hub(saw a post on the googlepixel subreddit) that comes free when you buy the 4.

Eh the radar seems pretty cool lol, the specs aren't phenomenal but its stock android so likely won't slow down as quick as Samsung or other phones with their own skins.. But Google announced the prices AFTER Apple launched the iPhone 11. So this doesn't make sense.. Prices are different around the world, see 

Note that the US price also does not include sales tax which are added on top of $699 whereas the Singapore price includes GST.

Another thing to note is that the US models, for example, has specific radio antennas that work best with 4G cell frequencies in the US. There are also China&HK vs Rest of the world models... so the products are not exactly identical to begin with either.. If you're bringing OnePlus into the table for comparison, chances are you're not the target audience.

This is for people who just want a smarphone that works without minding too much on the price tag or digging deep into the ecosystem and comparisons between devices. This is an iPhone ~~that's~~ that isn't branded an iPhone.

Personally for me, I need decent performance, fast Android update and a reasonable screen size, and as of now, I couldn't find it on any other device. Have spent more than a year on GSMArena searching by criteria every month or so. I settled for Pixel 3 and will strongly consider Pixel 4.. ""

The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the best argument that specs don‚Äôt tell you everything you need to know about a phone ‚Äî because the experience of using a Pixel 4 is better than any other Android phone.

""

[]( r/nicwy92 I suggest you watch [this]( before getting the pixel 4. While pure stock android supposed to be great, pixel phones don't have the best reputation when it comes to performance.

[](

&#x200B;

Personally I am still carrying around my Nexus 5 (running LineageOS) and an iPhone 5s. Both which perform adequately for most of the things I do. While I'm waiting for the 2020 iphone SE and the Note10 Lite, I am considering getting my spouse a new phone, she is an android user but the iphone 5s has been a champ compared to the nexus and getting updates still, which is why I was considering the iphone 11. But I feel a little cheated that the price here is inflated so much.. Wow still going strong with the nexus, old school i like it. Yea i've heard that pixel 3 had some bugs, and i was almost gonna buy that phone(3XL) few months ago due to a huge discount(only costs  ¬£500) but decided not to. 

I guess iPhone is the safest choice but i really want to believe they've addressed the bugs and pixel 4 won't be so faulty. I kinda think the phone looks adorable with that forehead üòÇüòÇ, 11 isn't too expensive, considering flagship phones nowadays cost at least 1000.. Omg fellow nexus user. I loved that phone so much. But the batter is really unbearable now dying within 3 hours or so.. Pixels are forever in beta.. ikr! Mine too. Luckily it has wireless charging so I just bought myself a wireless battery pack and it just charges when I place it down in my bag or on my desk.

Ps. My charging port broke too like 2 months ago which prompted me to buy the wireless battery pack in the first place. I did not know what I was missing, but now Im not getting any phone without wireless charging.",1127.0,36,22,1
128,A good location and timing to minimize my public nuisance,djz2m7,2019-10-19 04:41:16,"I want to start my hobby while serving NS by making short film and record cover song/music played using my instrument, sheng aka Á¨ô.

I only can do so on weekend.

Fellow singapore redditor, any advisory you have? like even better location, or good timing i should go to this places to do recording/filming session.

That‚Äôs how everyone does it. Nobody really plays live in music videos.. West coast park? It's pretty empty and far from houses, you shouldn't have an issue with noise complaints there. 

Or go to one of those big industrial ramp-up buildings on a Sunday, there will be nobody around. Just find a corner or a staircase.. Chinese garden should be quiet enough, plus the Chinese architecture there suits the vibe too. Are you filming because you want the video outdoors?. Why don't you just record and keep it ""live"" with audience.. Just go to places where many yps like to take tiktok videos.

You will never be more annoying nor cringier than them.. Hey, you can bring it along with you on route marches and play music while marching. I'm sure your PC, encik, and OC would enjoy it.

LOL. Have you considered renting a studio just for that? Afaik there are recording studios that let you rent the place.. In camp over the weekend.. Prime advice.

Yishun Dam/Kranji Dam. hmm staircase..... Chinese and Japanese gardens currently closed for renovations leh.

135,Freelancing is Great. Until Real Life Catches Up With You,djxdh6,2019-10-19 01:49:23,notexthere,37,0.83,35.0,"The most important line in the whole article.

\* This post was sponsored by Workforce Singapore. \*

Perhaps they need to understand that sometimes it's a matter of circumstances such as market choices and and not of choice. I'm a freelancer and have been doing it for the past 10 years. Would I like a full-time job with stability and decent prospects (not those sweatshop-style SMEs)? Yes. Unfortunately, it's probably unlikely at my age. 

I was lucky (or unlucky depending on how you see it) because I was still able to earning a living wage and have worked long to establish a decent network and reputation. The graduates of today are in a more precarious situation. Statistics, I believe, indicate increasing underemployment, unemployment and freelancing among fresh graduates. 

Of course, there are ramifications for such a trend. The lack of stability means that adults are less likely to start a family and more people will probably end up like me, a BBFA who shit-posts on Reddit, EDMW and trolls people.. The gig economy is not a celebrated new hype, it's a result of traditional companies not willing and able to generate jobs for the population.. Actually being a freelancer has its merits too, especially in the creative field. 

Imagine being able to constantly reinvent yourself in different pitches. It might be a hobby that pays you, if you are competent and open. 

Of course not every field offers equal financial rewards. Take Grab Drivers for example- the market is ruthless and it‚Äôs pure grind. But imagine if you are a sleeper, the money is definitely good.. Okay. Been a small business owner for 15 years. It's not easy. Some tips for those starting out:

1. No CPF nevermind. Insurance agents also have no CPF. Look for financial advisor for help. You have flexibility to choose and can be liquid at any time should you need capital. 
2. Insurance: this is very important. Medical fees are costly so make sure you pay for a plan that minimises the upfront costs (co-payment). It's a couple of hundred a year. I paid literally 0 for a $30k operation fee years ago.
3. Don't get into debt. Means don't buy a car and get crazy loans. These are all liabilities. HDB is good investment. Start small with a 3 room flat and upgrade where possible.
4. Learn a second skill if possible. Diversify your skills and network. It helps when one industry is down and you can go into another.. Freelancer here also.   


The thing is that its very hard to sustain in Singapore as a freelancer. In order to make a decent wage, you have very little time off and need to pick up a lot of jobs.   


And a lot of jobs can be very last min, so your availability for friends also depends on your work.   


The good thing is that you're not tied to a 9 to 5 job where you have little time or can't do other jobs. You can afford to pick and choose what pays you well or stuff that isn't boring.. too many freelancers are also bad.. there are no proper committee to tell freelancers what is the ceiling for fees  and what are the right etiquettes of freelancing. The more freelancers there are outside the more saturated the freelancing economy will be.. Back then lets say 20% of singaporeans are freelancing for a particular skills.. your fees can be high enough for hire/commissions. now lets say 40 - 50% of Singaporeans are freelancing.. you have to fight for it because many companies will get the lowest bidder... Most digital artists I know are freelancers. This is a completely biased piece with so many problems...

1. First guy doesn't make enough because work is irregular and he doesn't actively look for more work, he just waits for it to come. That is common sense. Hypothetically, if you have a stable part time job, you won't earn enough either, you have to actively look for new and better work. 

2. Second woman was an uber driver. So many issues in this story. Firstly, he assumes that medical not being provided was exclusive to the gig economy. Many many full time jobs don't cover medical either. The writer assumes that full time job = free medical checkups and gig economy = swamped with medical bills. 

3. ""if you don't work you don't earn"" sounds like every single job known to mankind. You have to work at least 40 hour weeks too. It's her choice that she worked overtime and destroyed her health doing so... It has nothing to do with the gig economy. At least she makes more with overtime. Many stable jobs don't pay for overtime.

4. The writer assumes that coasting is a normal part of a regular full time job. Maybe the writer coasts all the time instead of trying to write well though out arguments in his articles but there are many many many full time jobs where you just can't simply coast for a whole day.

5. There are days off if you want to work in the gig economy. You just have to be responsible and take 15 days off a year. He argues that you don't earn money in the 15 days. But that's the same as full time jobs. Companies definitely take into account how many days of leave you have when deciding how much to pay you, that's just good accounting. 

6. The writer argues that the gig economy had no cfp and that's a bad thing due to the employers contributions. Employers contributions is a lie. That money comes from what could have been your paycheck. In most private firms (aka non government jobs), people know that cfp is really 32 percent (you get 80 of every 117 dollars) and that you could be paid 17 percent more if there was no ""employers contributions"". The good thing about cpf is that it forces financially illiterate people to save, which is honestly fantastic, but if you were in the gig economy. You could easily do the same thing by just manually putting 32 percent of your salary into cpf. 

7. There is little career progression. That is true depending on the type of job. E.G. Uber driver or events model = little career progression. But for things like graphics, website design and art, you build up a cv. This allows you to get more and better paying gigs. Also, doing a like for like comparison, many blue collar full time jobs have poor career progression too. So it's not something exclusive to the gig economy. 

Lastly and most importantly, why the fuck would the article talk about the 3rd person's husband leaving her. Seriously???? Imagine giving someone an interview and when they say they like their job because of financial indepdence. Then in the article you write ""she likes her financial independence, it may prove useful if her husband leaves her"". It's so fucked up.... The writer should be ashamed. 

And even his fucked up comment is just wrong, if her husband leaves, she gets half of the money and alimony payments so she would still be fine... 

And she wouldn't be back at square 1 either what the fuck... Her time as a freelance graphics designer makes her more valuable to potential future employers if her work was good. It's like working at a company then changing firms. You won't say ""back to square 1"". That makes no sense. 

The writer should be ashamed of himself.. For below average, incompetent folks, PHV or food delivery gives them 4k a month, more than what they can possibly earn in the private sector.. It's just so much cheaper to hire freelancers as contractors on a per-gig basis because you don't have to be responsible for anything else you would be as an employer. You don't have to give medical benefits, paid leave, manage their well-being and career development, etc.

A friend working in HR shared that this might be the new trend because, in the past, one of the biggest incentives to fully employing a person for a job rather than hiring an external contractor is that you get loyalty and ownership of the job. These days however, we all know what happens to 'loyalty' and 'ownership'.. Now the trend is to have headcount freeze and hire contract staff. Yeah, I was doing gigs for awhile and it wasn't worth it. No CPF, no leave, no medical. If you don't work, you don't earn.. Actually it part of the larger growing eco-system of the economy. In the traditional world we had this in the service industry. Students as waiters at Chinese weddings are a good example. Now we also have the fully salaried doing gig jobs as part time after office hours. 

Whatever it is, it seems permanent part of the eco-system. 

The danger is those who do not plan ahead such as Grab and Uber drivers, Delivery personnel who are not covered by insurance, CPF and other expenses typically handed by traditional employers. 

The good part is that it is easier to get things done across the board with FLs in nearly every sector - architecture, software, curriculum building, infosec, booking,  etc. Also cost wise it is cheaper and faster as they are more nimble and many apps have good referrals and references.. Capitalism. The less externalities you have, the more profit you can make.

When market value is a matter of perception, capital doesn't even need labour to pay dividends anymore.

Just look at how the unicorn start ups are still surviving.. What is a sleeper?. Diversify income stream also.. Yeah my housing agent drives grab in-between viewings if he has a few hours to kill.. I agree that MANY companies will simply go for the lowest bidder- which might not be the best option. 

I think a good way is for the companies to lock in the amount they want to spend (ie, $3000 for a logo), and the freelancers send in proposals what they are willing to do for $3000.

This way, the freelancers know exactly what they are working for (in terms of money), and companies can objectively decide without cost being the differential.. Supply and demand. If there are too many freelancers, pay will suck and people will leave and take up full time jobs until pay increases to a level where the rate of people leaving and entering stay relatively constant.

Also, you don't want a committee to tell freelancers how much they should charge for their service. Unless there are externalities or market power abuse (aka many many sectors but not the gig economy), the free market allocates resources the most efficiently.. Let's not be facetious. It's not just the ""below average and incompetent"" who suffer from a lack of stable jobs.

Also, what's your issue with the more vulnerable in society? Isn't it in both society and their own best interests if they have a good career as well?. Hi Tao. That's because employers don't owe loyalty to the employees either. When the employer treats the worker as just a number to be squeezed, the worker is too tired and demoralized to even take ownership of the job. It goes both ways. 

I understand an employer's need to squeeze the worker as much as possible, but they can't have their cake and give nothing back in return.. Also, many traditional employers still rather hire full timers because they get to monitor full timers for ""efficiency"". Somehow meeting deliverables isn't enough and that if you work 9-5, your employees are on the job 100% of the time. 

As to whether that's the reality of things...... This will go one of two ways.

The govt will either pass laws mandating that companies offer benefits for all ""gig employees"", or they will raise business taxes to compensate for the substantial increase in the number of people needing medical or income supplements from the govt.

I very much doubt #2 will happen to keep up the appearance of a ""business-friendly"" country. #1 is already in the works in many countries because these rent-seeking ""gig economy"" peddlers are trying to game the system by offloading all the benefit work to the state while demanding no increase in taxes. Fuck these fuckers.. Companies be like perma-headcount freeze and THEN complain about ""talent shortage"".. I'd like to understand better what's up with the headcount freeze, there has to be something driving this but I don't see it. Every company is pushing out a 3 year experience mandatory for an ENTRY level job.

Dafuq is my generation supposed to do bruh.... This is not unique to the gig economy.  Hawkers, taxi drivers, owners of small shops etc.  Freedom has a cost, and being your own boss is not for everyone.. Hitman. Somebody like john wick. How is driving grab a worse career than working in a factory? The guy above was not being an asshole, he was just stating a fact, that it is potentially a good move for many less educated people to deliver food.. I think they‚Äôre trying to implement CPF to employers who hire freelancers now.wont be long till not even freelancers can escape from the 17/20% required by perm staff. Refuse to invest time or resources to train, rather hire from rival companies. 

Meanwhile the CEO will brag about how profits have been increasing every year.. Yes but it kills off all social security for them.

There's no paid leave of any sort - annual, parental or sick. There's no employer CPF contribution which will help fund retirement. There's no progression and the skills are non-transferable.

It's a good static pay. But dead end and can compromise their future.. Yeah has been the trend for a while. Everyone refuses to invest in their employees and openly ask for trained employees instead.

No reason to be loyal to any company. Just jump when u get a better offer.. This perpetuates the cycle though

Companies dw to train -> Employees keep jumping around -> Companies think people will leave anyway, why train them? -> Companies dw to train

As long as the stigma of being a job hopper goes away though, then it isn't so bad. Yes but employees can't afford to be the one to stay and eat losses. The scale is just too different to begin with. Of course I'm not saying training doesn't take money from the company but when MNCs also have this mindset, where does it stop? Just a lose-lose situation all around for both parties really..",2423.0,10,1,1

138,Recruit needs help to camo on,djw5vb,2019-10-19 00:05:28,"My face is damn oily and I sweat damn fast one so the camo basically never dries and drips everywhere (especially at my eyebrows). I'm going for outfield soon so if there's any tips or camo horror stories, please share with this chao recruit please.",16,0.75,26.0,"trick is you put minimal camo, if you put one big chunk and rub it in your face your whole camo will drip. Anyone that goes outfield is bound to sweat under the hot weather so you will not be the only one experiecing it. I myself also sweat easily and profusely and my best advice is ‚Äòless is more‚Äô. The most common mistake that people make when applying camo is to squeeze a large blob for the first layer which gives it no time to dry.  
Depending on how particular your commanders are and the time given to apply, best would be practising in front of mirror by applying layers while touching up throughout the day.. Just use ur uniform cuffs to wipe when sweaty. Sometimes bobian one, I also sweat alot personally but just have to tahan and resist the urge to wipe off too much camo. I have really oily skin too so what I do is I wipe my face (to remove oil) before applying the camo on. I sweat and like oil forms but I always resist the urge to rub my face. I only dab my face which usually doesn‚Äôt remove the camo. dont worry too much. camo on isnt enforced that tightly like safety of arms or field discipline.

just before the whole movement ‚Äúshow face‚Äù and camo on all together can liao. whenever they want you to camo on again just do it. its a simple anyhow process to cover your whole face+neck. ask buddy do lagi fast (protip dont ask buddy do when you new like recruit) 

talking about camo... i saw before a documentary that msia commando uses mud/soil. they spread on face neck and top naked body too. apparently works well to repel mosquito too. not sure if our mud/soil same anot.. Put the most minimal for the ""force-prep"" then heck care for the rest of it until instructed to re-camo on again

Dont bother applying any to your upper fore head because your helmet can cover that part

In the future when you head into unit life, because most outfield operates at night, you can even get away from not applying it at all. I was doing fire movement. Prone down got sand on my hands even though I was wearing gloves. After finishing, my face was sweating a lot and the camo came off. We were behind time and my sgt hurried me to camo on. I had to remove my gloves, unclip my ILBV and open up the zip lock bag just to reach the stupid tubes. Without thinking much, I squeeze the camo on my hand and begin rubbing it furiously on my face. My face was fking burning because of the sand and camo mixing together and my face and neck turn red.. From what I remember, the camo cream is oil based, so it won't ever really truly dry.

The trick is to use as little as possible, just a little goes a long way. Squeeze a little into hand and rub your hands together to spread it out then just rub your face, it should cover everything in a thin layer just enough to hide your skin colour. You don't need a thick layer at all to cover your skin colour. If you have time at home, just try it out in the shower while you're bathing, mainly so you family doesn't look at you funny and so that it's easy to clean off. Just a small dab in your hands in more than enough to cover your whole face in green.

For the other commenters that are saying to paint the black first then the green, doing it that way is gonna take forever or going to leave some of your skin colour showing. A sure fire way to be screamed at or getting asked to camo off and then camo on again. Totally fine to take your time when you're in unit but not so much when you're still in BMT, then again it's been a long time since BMT for me and maybe they're not so crazy on the shouting and rushing anymore.. Oily face? Try not washing with anything but water. No soap, not even non-soap cleanser. Nothing. Nadda. Just water. Because anything else strips the oil, then your face will make more oil to over-compensate. Same with oily hair. No shampoo, nothing but water. Hope this helps.. You can try the old type of camo stick. It is like crayon. It stick on any surface and difficult to wash off. I mean REALLY difficult.. Put a small amount (about the size of the tip of your pinkie) in your palm and rub your hands together to spread them thin and evenly in both hands. Then rub it all over your face. 

Touch up missed spots the same way too. Don‚Äôt put a bit on the tip of your finger and apply directly to face. This will make it too thick and won‚Äôt dry in time. Same with the black stripes.... One tip I've not seen in the comments section yet is to paint the black stripes first. You'll use less black anyway, so paint it on your face first while everyone else is going around asking for green.

Once your strips of black are done, apply the green on the remaining area. Do as lightly as you can while managing to colour your skin green.

Applying black before green ensures that you aren't putting on two layers of camo with due diligence.. My SBO would have 3 tubes of insect repellent, 2 tubes green camo and 1 tube of black. Didn't find putting camo on tough, though a mirror helps a fair bit.

Spread green camo on palms, rub em together then rub all over your face. If you can see your palms through the camo when you think you're done, you're not. Add more camo and repeat. Leftover camo green gets applied to the neck, ears and backs on your hand. Remember to puck your lips.

The black bit is easy. A drop on each finger, spread them, then swipe diagonally across your face. Leftovers go wherever you like. Neck, hands, whatever.

Done.

The insect repellent gets spread on the No.4 where there is exposed skin nearby. Loads go under the collar, cuffs, whatever.

Go outfield and green camo and repellent finish before black camo. Lmao.. Don‚Äôt rely on the modern camo cream. Learn to use the old fashion stick type

I had zero issues with sergeants telling me to re camo. I have a birthmark on my face and my Sgt ask me why i put camo on...

*Cries*. U could powder ur face then apply camo LOL idk if it will work but can try. Can confirm. The Chao recruit mistake is to put the camo on gao gao. Just put a thin a layer as possible. Once it starts to come off your commander will make you put it on again but just rinse and repeat until he happy. Also, put wayyyy less camo above the eyes! You dont want your sweat + camo mix to trickle into your eyes. That shit can sting your eyes.. Won't doing that wipe off camo more?. Putting mud on your body is a good way to get leptospirosis, especially in training areas with a repeated human presence.. God damn. I still remember having to heat it with a lighter to make it soft enough to apply.. Yeah this is terrible advice. OP you‚Äôre supposed to dab, not wipe.. not so learned on that. but i trust our MO can handle it. no matter what, go outfield confirm will come into contact with mud... no way to avoid one. maybe the msia counterparts got vaccinated, idk. but those commando training is badass.. Ah yes thats what I meant to say ‚Äúdab‚Äù thanks for the correction but you get the idea.. Most of our MOs are fresh out of their houseman year and symptoms of leptospirosis can include ""none"". So I'm not entirely confident ""our MO can handle it"".

Not exposing yourself to additional health risk factors is a far more sensible idea than some unnecessary gung-ho retarded gesture like smearing soil over your face.. to each his own, but i do trust MO quite enough. if its beyond what they can handle they would send you to hospital. my impression from nsf and nsmen time feels like they are rather prudent ‚Äî the patient needs to know how to talk (maybe even power play). 

yes fully agree with not exposing to additional health risk factors. my common sense only lead me to know that if i have open wound, i would surely keep it clean (no mud contact). but normal skin, i really wouldnt siam from mud at outfield. maybe i (we) got lucky and not claimed by darwin.",1468.0,6,45,1

140,Death row-counselling nun becomes first Singaporean to make BBC's list of 100 inspiring women,djvk60,2019-10-18 23:16:42,notexthere,114,0.96,7.0,"For those who wants to read it:

‚ÄúSINGAPORE - A Roman Catholic nun has become the first Singaporean to make the BBC's annual list of 100 influential women from around the world.

Sister Gerard Fernandez, 81, worked with the prisons for over 40 years as a death row counsellor, until she stopped in 2017. In that time, she ""walked with"" 18 inmates on death row, up to when they were executed.

Among the inmates she has worked with were Catherine Tan Mui Choo and Hoe Kah Hong, the women who helped temple medium Adrian Lim kill two children in the Toa Payoh ritual murder case in 1981.

The BBC's annual list features girls and women aged 15 to 98 from more than 50 countries. This year's theme for the 100 Women list is ""The Female Future"", which asks what the future would look like if it was driven by women.

Besides Sister Gerard, this year's list includes Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who criticised world leaders in a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in September, and Malaysian transgender rights activist Nisha Ayub, who was sent to a male prison at the age of 21.

BBC said on its website that many on the list are driving change on behalf of women everywhere. ""They give us their vision of what life could look like in 2030,"" it added.

Sister Gerard told The Straits Times on Thursday (Oct 17) that the news of her making it into the BBC list came as a surprise. ""I don't work for prizes and awards. I didn't think I'd get one at 81.""

""There are many women who live their lives for other people every day, and I admire those who work for others. I'm happy to be able to spread care and compassion to others.""

She co-founded the Roman Catholic Prison Ministry in 1977 and has explained that she counsels death row prisoners because ""the condemned need hope"".

""We may condemn them, but God condemns no one who comes to him,"" Sister Gerard said in a report in January.

Journalist Heather Chen, 32, who works at BBC News, nominated Sister Fernandez for the list, which has been running since 2013.

Having attended a Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) school, she heard of the nun and the Toa Payoh murder case growing up.

Ms Chen said: ""Her story was exceptionally strong because of how she would exhaust herself mentally for people on death row to help them accept their fates.""

Last year, Sister Gerard was featured in local film-maker Chai Yee Wei's Sister. The film looked at Lim's accomplices Tan and Hoe who were hanged in 1988. Sister Gerard spoke with them weekly for seven years, up to the moment they walked to the gallows.‚Äù. premium. [Here's the short film about Sister Fernandez's work with the Toa Payoh's murderers]( I guess it is pretty hard on workers with death-row inmates knowing that the people you minister to, will inevitably die. Really need to have high emotional tolerance for this line of work.. The film about her entitled Sister made the gallows scene look like the women were involved in some sort of cult suicide..  exhaust herself to prepare them mentally for death row?? they should probably think about the crime they committed beforehand if they have any brains.

Funny thing is some people supporting the bus drivers are also the same people complaining about the fare increases.. > # Issues raised by lawsuit claims affect 6,000 bus drivers, SBS Transit takes case to Industrial Arbitration Court

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî Saying that the wage dispute claims filed by five of its bus drivers raised some ‚Äúissues‚Äù, SBS Transit (SBST) is taking the matter to the Industrial Arbitration Court (IAC), which arbitrates industrial disputes and certifies collective agreements between unions and employers.

> This has to do with the collective agreement that SBST made with the National Transport Workers‚Äô Union (NTWU), and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that the agreement‚Äôs terms ‚Äúaffect not just the five individual bus captains, but also affect approximately 6,000 other SBST bus captains as well‚Äù.¬†

> A collective agreement is a contract negotiated by a trade union with the management of a company that regulates the terms and conditions of employees.

> The announcement on Friday (Oct 18) by SBST has ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù the five drivers, who filed lawsuits against the public transport operator last month. While the drivers‚Äô lawyer said that the IAC ""should rightly be used when there is a deadlock between the NTWU and the employer"", SBST¬†emphasised that this development ‚Äúhas nothing to do with mediation‚Äù.

> Separately, the drivers‚Äô claims will still be heard at the Magistrates‚Äô Court.

> SBST said in a statement that it is referring the case to IAC because the claims made by the drivers ‚Äúraise issues that arise from and affect collective agreements that SBST has entered into with NTWU‚Äù.

> Ms Tammy Tan, senior vice-president of corporate communications at SBST, said: ‚ÄúIt is to interpret collective agreements which have been called into question.

> ‚ÄúIn doing so, SBST is acting in accordance with the law, in the interests of all of SBST bus captains and in keeping with the letter and spirit of our excellent relationship with the NTWU.‚Äù

> In September, the five drivers sued¬†SBST, a member of ComfortDelGro, alleging that since they began working for the company, they have not been paid for overtime hours ‚Äî which is against MOM‚Äôs regulations.

> Before filing the lawsuits, one of the drivers was said to have met NTWU in July and with various parties from SBST and ComfortDelGro on Aug 27 but did not receive ‚Äúconclusive answers‚Äù.

> On Friday, the drivers‚Äô lawyer, Mr M Ravi from Carson Law Chambers, said: ‚ÄúHaving lost their confidence in the NTWU in the first place, our clients withdrew from the NTWU and rightfully sought redress from the court as a means to seek justice.‚Äù¬†

> The drivers were ‚Äútherefore surprised‚Äù by SBST‚Äôs latest move, Mr Ravi said, since they had ‚Äúfiled their claims in the Magistrates‚Äô Court after all discussion and internal processes with the employer and the union had exhausted‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúTo respect the rule of law and the jurisdiction of the court, the redress ought to continue in the courts and can be resolved amicably (if so desired) by utilising the mediation stage of the court process,‚Äù he added.¬†

> Asked to respond to Mr Ravi‚Äôs comments, Ms Tan of SBST told TODAY that ‚Äúthe reference to IAC has nothing to do with mediation‚Äù.

> She said: ‚ÄúSBST fully respects the jurisdiction of the court, which is why we will continue to vigorously contest the bus captains‚Äô claims in court.‚Äù

> In a statement, the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) said that applying to the IAC to interpret certain provisions in the collective agreement is a ""responsible and appropriate"" step for SBST to take.

> This is because SBST's collective agreement with NTWU¬†is certified by the IAC.¬†

> Mr Kandhavel Periyasamy, director of industrial relations with the labour relations and workplaces division of MOM, said that the collective agreement affects about 6,000 other SBST bus drivers. The IAC is thus a ‚Äúmore appropriate forum to deal with this matter as it is a specialised court to arbitrate on industrial disagreements and it serves to maintain industrial peace‚Äù, he added.

> When asked to comment, NTWU said it agreed that IAC will serve as an appropriate platform for disputes relating to employment matters.¬†

> ABOUT THE CASE

> The drivers ‚Äî comprising three Singaporeans and two Malaysians ‚Äî had alleged that their employer SBST breached contract terms on several fronts which include:¬†

> 

> 

> Expecting them to drive for seven consecutive days before getting a day off, which was purportedly not what they agreed on with SBST based on their letter of appointment. The Employment Act stipulates that shift employees should be given a rest day in each week, if they worked continuously for 30 hours.

> 

> 

> Getting them to work more than 44 hours a week, which similarly goes against the Employment Act.

> 

> 

> Underpaying them for overtime work done on their rest days. Workmen are entitled to claim overtime pay if their basic salaries do not exceed S$4,500, and their employers are expected to pay them a minimum of 1.5 times their hourly basic pay.

> 

> 

> The five of them are seeking damages to be assessed for wages, statutory interest of 5.33 per cent every year, and costs.¬†

Singapore should not be like other countries, he says.",djpyl7,2019-10-18 16:30:06,notexthere,0,0.39,17.0,"**Therefore and thereby**.... Therefore and thereby.... Therefore and thereby, greater political competition and diversity in parliament are bad things that could make us like other countries. That is apparently the point he is making. He seems to believe that only one political party can do the things he has mentioned. His post implies that he thinks it's a binary choice - PAP that cares for seniors, the young and those with needs against 'those who are truly politicians'.. I remember one of the opposition MPs criticized this false dichotomy in a speech in parliament shortly after the 2015 general election. He argued that [""casting the election result as a badge of national unity is deeply unhelpful"" as it suggests that ""what unites us as Singaporeans is our support for one political party"".]( 

The narrative that voting for the incumbent government is being a good citizen who wants Singapore to prosper is problematic because it oversimplifies politics into good versus evil. One side exclusively cares for the people whereas the other side only consists of troublemakers and traitors. Obviously this is not true. There are people in both the ruling party and the opposition who spend their precious weekends doing grassroots work and helping those in need.  Many of these people on both sides serve out of good intentions and do make meaningful contributions to the lives of others.  

Instead of oversimplifying the differences and voting out of a misguided desire for unity, it would be more logical if people actually looked at the parties and the individuals contesting. While the situation in some democracies like the USA is bad, this had more to do with the polarizing culture war than the mere existence of alternative voices in the legislature. It's ridiculous to use 'becoming like other countries' as a boogeyman to scare voters away from considering other parties. Even if 1,2,5 or 10 more opposition MPs were voted in, the government will not collapse or lose its super majority.  Things will go on as usual, but with more questions and interesting discussions in parliament. Singapore will continue to prosper.. why do people masturbate in public. >We are no longer a young democracy at 54 years of independence. We have grown so accustomed to only having one party running Singapore, and at times so dominant that it was 100% of all contested seats. Even today, there are only 6 elected opposition members out of 89 elected seats. The ruling party has so successfully, through the mass media and education, created the impression that they are the only ones who can make it. Singapore only has enough for one A team (which of course needed to be remunerated well to attract the best). We are so used to people excelling in their studies and careers being red carpeted into politics on the ruling party‚Äôs side, guided in through the GRC system. They are not expected to fail at elections, so much so that some people see only those who have won in elections as legitimate politicians, never mind that some of these ‚Äòwinners‚Äô hardly have to break any sweat contesting by coasting in through sure-win GRCs and having things nicely organised for them including by the ‚Äònon-political' PA.

>Any dirt or suspected dirt by any one in the alternative camp, whether politicians or just critics are magnified. Even segments of a poem that one wrote years ago as a 21-year old can be dug up and interpreted as unpatriotic, disruptive, or whatever they want to make it to be.  
>

>It is because I do not wish to see chaos and riots that I chose to stand in the alternative camp. Prior to 2011, I was concerned that we were betting everything on one party assuming that the PAP will forever be competent and honest.¬†

Former NCMP [Yee Jenn Jong's blog post]( has a pretty good response to this simplistic view that the opposition are the bad guys.. It's bizarre to see a politician warning us about 'those who are truly politicians'. It's almost as if he is trying to say that despite being a politician, he is not 'truly a politician'! Nice try, but a long-time card carrying member of the ruling party and former election candidate is no political outsider.. Therefore and thereby.... Too bad this guy isn't in my GRC, it would give me real physical pleasure to vote against him.. Twice you don't succeed, join the GRC. I will say... Mee Siam Mai hum.... Huh? What is he trying to say?. I'll respect him more if he continues being the fireman. He's itching for that MP title for far too long.. YES ENCIK!. That‚Äôs an amazing word salad that manages to say absolutely nothing.. Just waiting to see what other things get burned down in hk. Is it breadtslk or bee Cheng hiang. They better start some insurance.. Not allowed unless gpa high enough to make dean‚Äôs list. Voting in a few alternative voices will not turn Singapore into hong kong. We are a conservative society.

145,UOB bank's sales tactic to promote One account.,djp45l,2019-10-18 15:29:29,"I received a call from UOB that the bank is phasing out passbook saving account and encourages me to open their UOB One account to receive e-statement and gain attractive interest rate. I asked whether it is compulsory and she said ""strongly encouraged"" to do so. She sounds eager to make appointment for me. I rejected her and visited a UOB branch to find out more. It is then clear that it is just a sales tactic to promote and mislead consumer to sign up their One account which bundle with endowment, credit card and spending in order to enjoy the higher interest rates. Even though I did not sign up, I feel cheated with such tactic they engage with their customers.

Do you have similar experience?",7,0.7,10.0,"the one account does not have an endowment component. just purely savings account and credit card. personally I have both and they are pretty decent products in their own right.

I would say their marketing tactic is a bit misleading but not downright unscrupulous like getting customers to purchase an insurance plan. in this case it's just another account and card.. This is just the same old tactic bank sales managers or officers do to sell you the saving plans. Basically bait and switch by bank insurance agents. The person who called you may not even be the one you meet. 

Nowadays these banks hire people to do the cold calling, some of the people trying to get you to sit down at Mrts are not even RMs. 

I spoke to one before. She was desperate to get someone to sit down as I think she earns xx amount of you do and xx amount if you sign.. I think their goal is not the One account.

They just want to phase out the passbooks as it‚Äôs an additional cost to them.

It‚Äôs also why you are seeing less POSB outlets as well.. i visited a DBS branch recently, and they‚Äôre selling insurance products over the counter now. not just travel insurance. don‚Äôt they need get some license to sell insurance, and who honestly will get a plan over the counter? quite taken aback by this, as i believe there will inevitably be some trusting people who believes in the bank‚Äôs recommendation (i.e old people?). I was told it does, by prudential. I am fine with their product offering, But tricking customer to sit down and sell is cheating. 

Anyway just need to be more wary. They are losing customer trust.. [deleted]. I am all ready to move to estatement. They also propose stash which again offer higher interest under the condition your deposit is maintained at current or higher amount. 

The fact is they they did not offer alternative in changing my passbook account to estatement after i rejected their offer on One account and Stash. 

I guess no incentive for them then.. > **prudential**

in reddit (technically not a forum) it's ""Post"".. u ""submit a new text post"", not ""submit a new text thread"".. Wrong forum. EDMW too much ah TS?. Then it‚Äôs color, or colour ?. Whoa seeing TS really gave me flashbacks to my days of scrolling through the STOMP forum.. OP is used in every subreddit, not just in singapore. I'm assuming it's a question about terminology used in Singaporean Internet forums. ""TS"" would be ""Thread Starter"", while ""OP"" is ""Original Poster"" (or ""Original Post""). Both refer to the same thing, but just different names.

(I've also seen ""TC"" for ""Thread Creator"", but I don't know where it comes from. I've only seen it on Reddit and GameFAQs.). Yes but why is TS normally used in local non Reddit forums notably HWZ? that's what OP is asking. Ah. And ‚Äòusenet holdover‚Äô?. ""Usenet"" is probably better explained by Googling (because it would take too long to get into all the nuances), but it's basically a form of (and the precursor to) discussion forums and such.

> SINGAPORE: PBT Engineering has been awarded a contract to design and install 5.5km of railway noise barriers under the third phase of the railway noise barrier programme, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Friday (Oct 18).

> This phase will cover 16 locations, spanning from Pasir Ris to Kembangan stations along the East-West MRT Line and from Jurong East to Khatib stations along the North-South MRT Line.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ‚ÄúWhen completed in 2023, the noise barriers are expected to reduce noise levels from passing trains by about 5 to 10 decibels,‚Äù LTA said in a news release.

> The tender was announced in December last year.

> With the inclusion of this phase, the total length of noise barriers installed across Singapore will be 27km.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The type of noise barrier depends on the noise level and profile of the tracks, LTA said. Semi-enclosed barriers will be installed at turnout sections, where trains switch tracks, as they can handle higher noise levels. Installing such noise barriers usually takes three times as long as vertical barriers, which will be installed along plainline or straight tracks.

> LTA said the installation of the noise barriers has ‚Äúgained momentum due to the implementation of early closures and late openings‚Äù for stations along the North-South and East-West lines.

> ‚ÄúThe additional engineering hours have provided LTA and SMRT with more track access time for maintenance and improvement works, including the installation of noise barriers.‚Äù

> Phase 3 of the installation works is set to be completed in 2023. Phase 1 was completed in 2018, while on-site works are currently ongoing under Phase 2 with completion expected to be by the third quarter of 2020.

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( There's  a whole thread somewhere on Singapore's most infamous forum dedicated to sharing links of females selling clothes on carouhell with photos like the girl in the article - revealing skin and / or in provocative poses.

Some also teach people how to create a 'female' account and 'dress it up' to make it look more convincing so chances of getting what they want from 'the same sex' is easier (cause some girls totally ignore seemingly guy accounts who want to buy clothes from them)

I think it‚Äôs cos there‚Äôs a giant at Paya Lebar Square, a FP finest at SingPost and another FP finest at PLQ haha

KINEX is losing its relevance esp cos it‚Äôs not that near the mrt. [deleted]. Never heard of this mall in my life.. I mean PLQ opened not too long ago, which means that there are now 3 malls, paya lebar square, Singpost and PLQ pretty much next to each other. In addition those 3 malls are right in front of paya lebar mrt while KINEX is furthur away.  Therefore, why would someone want to go to KINEX when they can walk a much shorter distance to 3 malls.. That mall was a mistake from day one.  
Cold Storage is over priced. And with Amazon and Redmart, never really need to set foot in a grocery store again.. guess KINEX is getting put into cold storage. There's two FairPrice outlets nearby, namely FairPrice at SingPost Centre & FairPrice Finest at PLQ Mall, as well as one Giant at Paya Lebar Square & another Giant at Tanjong Katong Complex, not forgetting the FairPrice at Joo Chiat Complex.

Hence, the competition from several supermarkets nearby might have contributed to the closure of Cold Storage at Kinex.. Not surprised, Kinex a.k.a one KM is a fucking joke. 

Many shops have moved out already, theres just too much competition around that area and theres even a new fucking mall just open in that area; Paya Lebar Quarter.. Just go there for fatburger's shakes. Hopefully it gets replaced by a FP or a Sheng Siong. Cold Storage is ex.... Not maid and tour agencies?. outlet store too. No idea why tho. Are they trying to make Paya Lebar a new jurong or what?. Let's count the malls in Paya Lebar:
Kinex,
Singpost Centre,
Paya Lebar Square,
Paya Lebar Quarter,
Tanjong Katong Complex,
City Plaza,
Wisma Geylang Serai (not a mall but still there's shops n eateries)..

Competition gao gao. Kinex had no purpose. Formerly known as One KM, they changed the name to Kinex.. kinda like situation at Jurong...

  
IMM is near most HDB area so everyone around there will usually shop at giant, while JEM fairprice serving people staying in the west. so these malls still have their crowd, especially when they are all linked tgt now (RIP Big box though it's just a concept not feasible) 

  
Jcube suffered because there's literally one fairprice at the HDB beside the mall itself... the food court only have less than 5 stalls opening on the last time I walk past... the only thing that keeps people coming to jcube are mostly just the ice-skating,teoheng and astons...  but maybe when the jurong interchange finally shifted out again (which is right in front of library), more people will be visiting jcube by then... the other mall will still have their MRT station crowd.. I find it weird that both Singpost and PLQ have Finests, since they‚Äôre so close to each other.. tbh it sucks, i can't quite put my finger on why it sucks but i just rlly don't like the interior for some reason. Yes. Seems like the strategy these days is to keep people away from town unless absolutely necessary. Never heard of One KM in my life as well. The FairPrice at SingPost Centre is a normal NTUC FairPrice while the one at PLQ Mall is a Finest outlet and I agree that they're located too close to each other üòÖ. Keeps the waiting in line shorter.. There‚Äôs a normal NTUC and finest opposite each other at Tanjong pagar as well. then the question is...what is ""town"" tho? Orchard? Plaza Sing? Bugis?
Between these 3 places, there are already plenty of space to ""shop"" already.. Near Haig Road there.. Ironically Cold Storage still uses thay names for outlet, that explains why I never heard of Kinex either.

From my experience, you gotta spend a lot of money, become a regular, be friends with the boss, be friends with the agent, hang flower on all her friends before you can even get a foot in the door.

The puyings there for are working a living, hoping to find rich SD to change their life for the better, to get the next nose job and boob job and upgrade themselves. Get more money to feed their family, their kids, their parents, their village.

How bout the author head down to Brix at Hyatt, there's a great story waiting to be told there.. siam diu for life, siam bu for wife. Yes but different feeling leh, go to siam diu, ktv etc is more for girlfriend experience rather then sex. I have friends who will go ktv finish then after that go geylang.. Bro got this kind of place also cannot deter NUS students and lecturers from sex crimes how.. The Supreme Gentleman.... This explains the situation in HK so well. Angsty teenagers with raging hormones who don't get their dose of budding sexuality, who then resort to politics and violence for a kick.

I almost feel guilty saying that (but I don't ).. Aren't strip clubs pretty expensive too?. Only the hiring part is somewhat right. It's just like a normal club with different scene.. Is fake alcohol a thing? I thought only for china. Can't confirm if the rest is true but definitely the place is patronized by regular people.  Low SES may be, but definitely not hooligans only.  You have anything to back up your claims?. old bird spotted. Definitely much cheaper gfe in Pattaya vs siamdu. I guess some guys think the siamdu siambu are really their girlfriend. Yeah, she's your gf as long as you keep hanging $1000 garlands.. True true. But sometimes can get gfe in the massage places too. Just book them whole day.. You can get GFE from BKK too, at much lower price.. The only logical solution is Siam diu inside NUS. There is some truth to this. White nationalist violence and islamic terrorists are mostly incels. Modernity has put them at a disadvantage in the sexual market place. Hence they want to go back to an idealised past. Im not suprised if the nativist in the hong kong protest fall under this catogory.. Not necessarily.  If you‚Äôre sitting in the front, you‚Äôre expected to tip, but only like a few bucks. Strippers will try to get you to buy them expensive drinks, but it‚Äôs not necessary.  You can get a lap dance for $20. Buying bottle service is a rip off, but you can nurse a couple beers for awhile.  Overall, way more fun than pretending to be rich while going broke for some attention from the girls.. Only the atas ones don't apply. Mainly true for the rest.. Experienced fake hard liquor more than once. Beer commonly watered down. Not all, is my disclaimer.. How do low SES afford it? Lol... Saying such places are patronized by hooligans doesnt mean regular people don't patronize it.. ahaha. yes. kinda old for Reddit.. *slow clap*. I mean there's been many a story about uni students working as escorts to pay for tuition fees, so there's much worse than doing so where you'd presumably be reasonably protected (assuming the unis would ensure their safety in this hypothetical). Why pay for siamdiu when got hall xmm?. You're fucking hilarious.  Upvote for me !. Doesn't sound plausible. Lots of HK protestors are young girls. I would have thought it is more likely that young teens join in the protests hoping to get laid. got downvoted for truth lol. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre low SES.. Zero sum game. Kinda explains his point. Hall xmm = potential sexual harassment case; in the siam diu, at least the rules of engagement is rather clear and quantifiable.. Opinion =/= truth. Welcome to the modern age, where the universal right to an opinion is conveniently mistaken to mean that all opinions are right. Except yours. Mine is always right.

E: Apparently some people can't read. Do I really need to put a disclaimer?. And when i dont believe u, u must be wrong or in this situation, a wumao bot.. Precisely. It's infuriating, especially when dealing with anti-vaxxers, anti-intellectuals, conspiracy theorists, etc. The right to *an* opinion is used to qualify *their* opinion, regardless of the *objective verity* of said opinion. Somehow *this same right to an opinion* does not apply to *differing* opinions.. ‚Äú im not talking to u since u dont believe me! I bet u dont even read bla bla bla and god will help me!!!! ‚Äú

152,A screenshot (apparently from a HK protest chat group) making the rounds on Twitter in response to Lee Hsien Loong's comments on the China-HK crisis,djlddf,2019-10-18 10:09:48,notexthere,98,0.85,190.0,"If one actually bothered to listen to the speech, one wouldn't be saying that LHL was talking crap about HK. He was actually very neutral about the whole thing and was just asking a rhetoric qn.. I feel like some of the HK protesters are being childish now.   
They have this 'Agree with us 100%, or you're the enemy"" mindset   
Don't get me wrong. Fundamentally, i still support their push for freedom.  
However, some of the recent level of violence and chaos committed by some protesters , combined with the lack of disapproval from the majority of the peaceful protesters have made me less sympathetic towards them.. It feels to me like the HKers have been throwing shade at Singapore for forever. 

So am I surprised? No, this was bound to happen at some point.. I'm gonna laugh real hard if they start torching DBS/UOB banks over there. It's becoming absurd now.. I'm not going to generalize millions of protesters based on a message by one lunatic. /r/hongkong had two posts about LHL's speech, with 70 comments and 30 upvotes combined. Most of them obviously reacted negatively, but not to this extent and definitely without any calls for violence. Some of them were just neutral, or disappointed. If people do actually end up vandalising banks I'll eat my words but I feel like this post is just jumping to a hasty conclusion based on a single screenshot.. I feel like HKers are trying so hard to find enemies. Singaporeans online have said time and time again that we are with HKers, but they always keep trying to find reasons that we aren't.

You know, whatever man. We don't owe you our support or anything. We don't need to keeping trying to make them happy if they're going to be toxic about it.

I don't like the mainlanders one bit, but I'm kinda indifferent about HK at this point. Let them think what they want to think.. Tbh just let them talk. They can‚Äôt even take take their own public transport anymore because they destroyed it. How childish... There‚Äôs literally nothing wrong with fighting for your own rights and freedom and welfare. But look now you‚Äôre making everything worse for yourselves.... Are there any SG property in HK other then Embassy? Just asking.. This type of people are cowards deep down inside; just see them melt and and beg for mercy once cornered.. can someone translate? idk chinese sorry. Destroy lor. If you touch the consulate good luck to them because it's no longer whacking China but another sovereign country. You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.. For the lazy and spoon feed people... here is the URL i religiously typed out... 



The article translated to English...

[Fugitive Offenders Ordinance] Lee Hsien Loong refers to the five major demands for helpless bombing Hong Kong demonstrators to overthrow the government

Singapore‚Äôs Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on October 16 that the five major demands put forward by Hong Kong demonstrators, including full-scale universal suffrage and the release of alleged riots, were attempts to humiliate and overthrow the Hong Kong SAR government.
This is the strongest rhetoric he has made since the beginning of the anti-reform demonstration in Hong Kong.¬†He also commented on the incident in early October, saying that the current situation in Hong Kong is not caused by the central government.

Lee Hsien Loong commented on the five major demands of Hong Kong demonstrators when attending a business meeting in Singapore.¬†He pointed out: ""Those requests will not be a plan to solve the problems facing Hong Kong. Those demands are an attempt to humiliate and overthrow the government.""
He also pointed out: ""We say that we must be universally elected. There is no simple solution. Hong Kong is not a country. It is a special administrative region."" Lee Hsien Loong also pointed out that legislative reforms or social policies may help restore order, but this is not an easy task. .
He said: ""When Hong Kong is in trouble, there are demonstrations or more serious riots, when the Chief Executive is slammed out of the Legislative Council Chamber, I think this is very sad for Hong Kong. Unfavorable."" Lee Hsien Loong said that the country is concerned about the situation.

The situation at the beginning of the month: the government needs to solve the housing problem
Lee Hsien Loong was not the first to comment on the anti-reform demonstration.¬†He was interviewed by the CNN and aired on October 6.¬†During his visit, he first talked about the situation in Hong Kong.
He said that Hong Kong is a city full of talent, innovation and potential. He regrets the current situation in Hong Kong.¬†He said that Hong Kong has enjoyed growth opportunities because of China's backing and has been able to weather many economic crises. At the same time, returning to China is a huge psychological change for Hong Kong people and it is difficult to adapt.

""There are some fundamental problems in Hong Kong society, such as accommodation."" He thinks this is about whether the younger generation has hope for the future.¬†If these problems cannot be solved fundamentally, it will be difficult to overcome the current difficulties facing Hong Kong.. [removed]. Sigh..... It seems that just like some mainlanders, some HKongers are clearly overreacting and cherry picking LHL's comments. As mentioned by others in related threads, LHL makes the stand that BOTH mainlanders AND HKongers need to give temper their current position with regards to the One Country Two Systems policy. If this isn't a kindly worded rebuke to both sides I don't know what is. Honestly when I first read LHL's statement I thought PRC was gonna erupt in a fit saying he is taking the protestors' side of the argument.. Just proves his point.... ITT : HK protestors feeling lost and confused in a civil society is actually in agreement with and supporting their government and appointed leader, and not just jumping onto the pro-hk democracy and anti-china bandwagon.. This affirm my stand to to stand against these terrorists and support the Hong Kong police.. I feel this is such an inflammatory post. 

Is it wrong to do this? Absolutely. 
Do these radical tactics represent the majority of HKers? Absolutely not. 

Just because 1 person posted it, it is incredibly disingenuous to assume this represents hkers.
You can be for the protests, but against violence. 
This screencap looks like it's from a Telegram group. This represents the more 'hard-core' element. Please do not think most hkers are like this.

The same could easily be said for Singaporeans. The was a thread in the hk sub showing a PM that a Singaporean guy sent to a HKer, telling him he's ""a brainwashed fuck and to kill himself and his family"". 

Then the thread descended into attacking Singaporeans. Just like this thread has descended into attacking HKers. 

Just because 1 idiot said something stupid, it does not mean it represents the majority of people in that place!. I cant help but think ""someone"" is delibrately targetting SG to invoke a response.

My theory is that the police dressed up as protestors are directing the violence and destruction. Call it suicidal but it could be in the governments interest for chaos to increase so they can bring in the tanks. 

But its just a idea and since we aren't in Hong Kong... its not my problem.... you find 1 view that seemingly targets you and curse the entire movement. aren't you much worse?. What petulant children. I mean, i don't like the guy but there's no need to use profanities to make your point.. And DBS share price fell by 0.64% to $24.78



Yawn.... >If one actually bothered to listen to the speech

That's the problem for most people on Reddit, they don't and they react based on clickbait titles and the rest run along with it.. It's just that you can't expect some dopamine-addicted vagrants with no understanding of subtlety, strategy or long-term thinking, to be able to parse through PM Lee's comments in a rational manner. All they can express is ""me angry me burn house"".. ""If you're not with me, then you're my enemy."". Exactly. They started off as an admirable clarion call for freedom. Now they are just as farcical in their views as the very entity they are protesting. The irony.. HK protestors turned from Episode 1 Anakin Skywalker to Episode 3 Anakin in like less than 6 months ...

Now they think that freedom and democracy gives them the right to hate and impose an iron will and fist on anything they disagree with, and to met out extrajudicial punishments as they feel.. I support Hog Kong's push for democracy and freedom.

At this stage, I \*do not\* support the violent protesters.

No actions by the black-shirts suggest they respect democracy and/or freedom. Their actions of beating up/doxing anyone who disagrees with them, labeling businesses as either for or against, is no better than the CCP. Their attacks on anyone who speaks Mandarin is a display of extreme xenophobia.  They blatantly only share news in their favor, and threaten any journalist who cover them negatively. They act more like Mao era red guards than any actual democratic force. 

If they were magically giving power, I cannot conceive them building a functional democracy.. You only feel they are childish now?

Lmao after they have burned half their city down and completely fucked their entire generation, you think it's only now they are being childish?. As if r/HongKong doesn't jump to hasty conclusions at the drop of a hat.

Between the western snowflakes and the amped up hormonal HK teenagers in there, you'd be forgiven if you thought that you entered 4chan accidentally.

Even the protestors movement themselves is split along many lines. The most fundamentalist and radical ones are the teens online in LIKHG and r/HongKong.. To be fair, Singaporeans only are actually pretty clearly divided on the issue. The older generations especially are no where near supportive of the HKers.. Not buildings but you have SG businesses such as Breadtalk, Toast Box and Bee Cheng Hiang. Remains to be seen if they will be targeted.. I think [this]( counts.. there are a few sgx stocks with signifcant HK explosure which are at a all time low price now. could be worth picking up if you believe that HK would recover eventually. ##fuckmadamkwageokchoo
##renovateDBS #renovateSGEmbassy #renovateUOB. Me neither. Though I suppose it could be Cantonese since it's from HK. Someone pls translate!. Calling it now.

The main reddit page will find some way to say its LHL and Singapore's own fault for not totally supporting the protestors.

Probably the only way Reddit stop supporting them is if they whack US consulate but they still got enough brain not to do so.

EDIT: And [curtains up people!]( I'm already seeing China-lite and dictatorship mentioned.. Or just villain masquerading as hero and now the mask falls off. It's interesting to see how strongly the HKers feel about us. All LHL did was express a perfectly neutral and balanced view of the crisis. He was tactful enough to not come across as explicitly supportive of either side. Instead of acknowledging this, they want to burn down our diplomatic missions.. Truth. Singapore is the new chiobu in the region, while HK is on an Amy Winehouse downward spiral - blaming everyone from Singapore to NBA to Blizzard for everything while US and UK can obviously do no wrong.. Agreed. All these sour grapes... they should do a self reflection and ask themselves if they had gone overboard... instead of giving excuses to continue their mayhem.. > i hope hong kong burns itself down. Then hopefully all their MNCs will shift to SG and we get all the juicy job

This is undoubtedly extremely selfish and short-sighted. Hoping that HK burns itself, regardless if you support the protestors or not, is evil and unwarranted. Its this sort of nationalistic drum-beating that is the antithesis of the pragmatism you claim you espouse.

You think MNCs and jobs will move to Singapore? Sure, the wealth will move here, but the jobs will not. It will move to ASEAN/India where labor is cheaper. Banking Ops have been moving to India for the longest time, and this will only exacerbate the trend. HSBC has started hiring in Manila, not Singapore. So what happens when wealth moves here? You see property prices skyrocket and cost of living increases.

The idea that Singapore is better off if HK burns itself to the ground is synonymous to the trumpian ""zero sum game"" ideology. No wonder HK protestors dislike Singaporeans; they see comments like ""I wish HK burns itself down"". How exactly you do think protestors feel when they see comments like this?

I'm not pro-HK protestors here, I recognize that a subset has gone too far. But this comment is another extreme.. I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/hongkong] [From \/r\/Singapore: ""let them burn themselves to the ground. I hope Hong Kong burns itself down""](

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*. Lmao your comment got linked on r/HongKong. Prepare for an angry flood of salty HKers bro. lmao look at this jackass. [removed]. Likely CCP manipulates the news to portray LHL as being pro china. 

They could have as equally portrayed LHL as being pro HK but that would not have been to their advantage.

It's a dumbed down world today. People don't really want to consider and contend with complex geopolitics and socio economics issues, and instead prefer simple China bad HK good type bandwagoning (complete with a simple to understand mascot and meme), which is what an unchecked and unregulated media results in.. I wouldn't call them terrorists, rioters at best.. So you support sexual harrassment by the police on the protesters? Did you know there has been over 100 kids under 10 that has been arrested by the police for no reason? People have been showing up dead with their limbs missing and the police ruled these incidents as suicide. They also attack the press on purpose. How can you support the police, even if you don't support the protests?. Also do you know how China treat the Muslims? Millions of them are sent to concentration camps and are tortured and experimented on and have their organs harvested. How can anyone, in good conscience support the CCP?. Right so now Singaporeans in this thread are the oppressors and HKers are once again the victims even though they are hurling bombs and bricks , and wielding hammers and rods, while making threats of violence .

Great rhetoric. Way to pull us down to their standards.

Compare r/HongKong and r/Singapore side by side and tell me that r/HongKong is not a one sided rhetorical political group that has only a singular ideological narrative, and I'll show you both an idiot and a liar.

You don't need one person to say or do something stupid in r/HongKong when the whole sub has become an ideological shouting echo chamber of hate and spite.. The circlejerk is in full force on both sides. This sub regularly whines about the rest of the world generalizing us as part of china, or about racial stereotypes within singapore. Whenever someone gets stomped for shitting in public or doctors get arrested for malpractice everyone is quick to point out ""that's a PRC/native indian"" and shift blame away from the ""real"" singaporeans. They criticize others for not being able to tell the difference. Whenever someone gets accused of rape everyone throws up PSAs warning us not to believe unsubstantiated screenshots or claims without proof. We bitch and whine about POFMA.

And yet this post displays all of those qualities. Generalizing, stereotyping a massive movement based on the actions of a few. The refusal to think of these nutjobs as anything other than ""real"" protesters. Mocking anyone who dares to claim that the protesters differ in their views and methods. Swallowing a single, unsubstantiated screenshot without question because it fits their worldview.

/r/hongkong does this too, as seen in your link. We make claims like ""just because the police are violent, that doesn't make it okay for protesters to assault and bomb them"". And yet both sides have no issues claiming that ""the other side thinks we are a violent mob/brainwashed by china, but there is no reason why I cannot call them brainwashed/a violent mob and hope for the breakdown of their country and the deaths of their people"". 

The heartlessness in some of these comments is truly staggering. I didn't know all the edgelords from EDMW migrated here. You can condemn the protests without hoping for their economy to collapse just so that SG's economy can boom instead. We make claims like ""they don't care about the five demands anymore, they just want to humiliate their government and vandalise their country"" and yet have no issues pretending to be concerned about the welfare of HK's people while actually hoping for their demise in order to divert money to our economy.

Waiting for some retard to drop /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM for that XD GOTCHA karma.. Reddit isnt the problem here. The amount of social unrest and tension in Hong Kong has them wound up crazy tight. The levels of violence on both side have only been escalating.

This response is to be expected at this point. Have you tried to calm an angry person down with a level headed response? Now imagine that, but with a mob, one with no real leader figure.

The response is not from a level headed leader after much thought, this is a public protest that's acting like a hivemind/hornet's nest right now.

I think some level of understanding should be given and Singapore should take this response with a grain of salt and dose of empathy.. It's over Hong Kong, I have the high ground. You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. 

In the case of the HK protests however, it took them...4 months to be the villain.. I supported them when it was umbrellas and demonstrations.

Then it turned to violence , petrol bombs , throwing bricks and hunting police with hammers and steel pipes.

How to support _that_ ? 

The movement lost credibility the moment it turned violent. Mandela, MLK and Gandhi , the three protest gurus of our modern generation would not have agreed with their behaviour.. i think about what's going on in HK sometimes and every time graffiti makes the rounds on social media - i'm just thinking about *who has to do the cleanup*.

it's really not going to be anyone protesting, that i'm sure. A very small subset of protestors versus how China has been trying to censor everything pro-HK. Let's not forget all the police violence too. Chan Yin-lam ring a bell? One wonders where their orders really come from. 

But yes, bOtH sIdEs ArE the SaMe.. Almost as if we're being fed hyperbolic reporting by the most powerful nation on Earth, because that would benefit them more.. Shit. I really don't want to see our beloved Singapore store to destroy.. I really hope they will not hurt the students.. **Singapore International School**

Singapore International School (SIS) is a kindergarten, elementary and secondary (up to Form Four and International Baccalaureate Diploma First Year and second year) school situated in two different campuses on Nam Long Shan Road, Hong Kong Island.

It is an international school run by the government of Singapore and follows the Singaporean curriculum. The school was established in September 1991 in Kennedy Town with an enrollment of 200 students. This number has risen above the 1000 students mark, from a variety of nationalities, with the majority being Hong Kongers and Singaporeans.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28. Probably gonna fall a bit more. HK protest needs to end first and I doubt there's gonna be a good end.. What are these shares?. The hell? They really namedropped LKY‚Äôs wife?

I‚Äôm gonna assume ‚Äúrenovate‚Äù is code for ‚Äúvandalise‚Äù.. Traditional chinese. Cantonese is a dialect, not a written language.. oops yea i just realised that, lemme just edit. Yup, I have friends in R&D in Hong Kong. Some are lecturing in Unis. All of them despise the protests. They are no literally storming classrooms and disrupting class, saying ""If we are sacrificing our futures for HK, you must too"".. Now imagine that the Mainland Chinese media somehow took offence to PM Lee's neutral statement and printed negative articles about that, causing China social media to spit vermon at Singapore. Would these Hong Kongers be waving Singapore flags and praising PM Lee for standing up to the communists?. It's ideological extremism.. Have you considered that you cherry-picked a few particularly angry reactions and are using these to characterize and generalize millions of people? Most of whom support and participate in the movement but not in any aggressive action? I can assure you, we don't wish to ""burn down your diplomatic missions"" or burn down everything. But when our city has been reeling from a police force gone rogue terrorizing the common people‚Äîcountless cases of sexual violence against female protesters by the police, police refusing to present ID to even legislators and goverment officials to certify that they are actually police, police awarding a taxi driver for ramming his car into a crowd of protesters and crippling a girl for life, and police disguising as rioters and openly cooperating with Triad gang members to assault civilians on the streets, there is a very human reason why people in Hong Kong have been stirred to anger. 

People like you mock us for ""destroying our city"" and yet ignore the fact that we have had numerous peaceful protests of millions of people only to be faced with abject brutality. I am not saying that I condone the recent targeting of pro-Beijing businesses by more radical protesters, but to ignore how these are reactions born out of desperation for the pain innocent people have had to suffer for our non-violence or the erosion of the rule of law by the police is to judge from a position of hateful prejudice. In times when the police themselves riot and indiscriminately assault the people and the people are defenceless, is it not understandable that there will be some who, out of their grief, react in fury against the people that mock and jeer are us for the losses of those we care about? Like what you are doing now because you don't understand the full situation?

So to go back to your statement that LHL presented a very neutral and balanced view of the crisis, he did not. His was a very overtly pro-CCP one because it deliberately misleads the public that our issues are economic in nature, thereby dismissing our humanitarian goals, and because he claims that we only wish to ""humiliate"" the government, a highly subjective term that downplays once again all our humanitarian concerns and our outrage at the executive and the CCP for defying the rule of law in the first place. His statement also dismissed the fact even portions of our government, including most of our lawyers and courts, have rebuked the conduct and transgressions of the law by the police and the executive and sympathize with the movement because, once again, it is the CCP and the police which are destroying the rule of law above and beyond what any protester has ever done.

And by the way, we don't hate Singaporeans. I, especially, have always admired Singaporeans like our close friends due to our similar background as prosperous city-states.. I think the point is that he should not have opened his mouth about this. Are those PRC netizens on Weibo cheering him going to pay for any Singaporean property in HK that is inevitably going to get damaged? They probably won't remember in a few days and will go back to shrieking about how we are a lapdog of the US and enabling separatism by training our army in Taiwan.  


Also, while I agree that he was trying his best to avoid explicitly supporting either side and he did come pretty close, saying that the 5 demands are motivated by a spite in an attempt to humiliate the government is not 'perfectly neutral and balanced'.  Just because these demands are allegedly politically impossible in the current environment does not mean that people do not have very practical reasons for wanting them. OF course, if he had said that, the Chinese netizens, would now be angry with us. The rest of the interview was a lot better, but have a guess what is in the headline now?

This is quite literally the most obvious no win situation on the planet. As obvious as not bringing up the 40 years past Cambodian civil war when you write a fucking obituary.   


He should have kept his mouth shut and said something non-statement statement about how we hope for a peaceful resolution and blah blah blah...  Maybe the noncompetitive nature of our domestic politics makes these people less careful than they should be.. He said the demands were aimed at humiliating the HK government, which is of course untrue and undermines their cause. They want democracy, not to shame their government.. I mean you can put yourself in their shoes right? if you go back and undo history and we now faced a prosperous independent Singapore facing impending take over from a corrupt and undemocratic Malaysia wouldn‚Äôt people be equally angry? 

People disappear in HK and appear suddenly in mainland propaganda videos apologising, so basically kidnaped by government in middle of night. Can you imagine if it happened here except Malaysia was doing it? 

What if they said Singapore can have elections but they have to approve the candidate list, and then proceeded to reject any non UMNO candidates (assuming king of corruption Najib was still in power).

The situation is messed up, in the end the Chinese are behaving like it‚Äôs part of China because it IS part of China. But it doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy for people who lived free for decades to suddenly embrace their new overlords with a loving embrace.. oh boy. come lah limbei scared hongkie meh. China isn‚Äôt communist lmao. They did use a bomb you know. Trains have also been derailed. They even attempted to stab a police officer in the neck. They also hunt lone policeman in groups of a dozen wielding hammers and rods.

I mean these are no longer the nice yellow umbrella holding ah mahs we saw on TV 3 months ago.

If that's not terrorism , then I don't know what is.. So because a person supports a different opinion or party then he automatically supports sexual harrasment, dismemberment and so on ?

What kind of logic leap is thst ?

Also according to you the HKPF goes around arresting children, hacking limbs off, murdering people , attacking the press and all sorts of other evils.

I mean I don't see this ? These are just your claims.

What I do see on videos captured is groups of rioters barricading roads, burning down MTRs, attacking people they disagree with, detaining passengers at airports , hunting down and attacking lone policeman in groups with hammers, destorying public property, there's even a video of a rioter trying to stab the neck of a police officer. 

The police are mostly following their training and SOPs and ROEs. And have actually been far milder than compared to the police during the yellow vests protests in France.

Guess which sells newspapers better ?.      The fact remains that a post like yours which treats the topic neutrally and objectively simply wouldn't exist in r/HongKong.

In there it's the pro HK rhetoric or you GTFO, there's no middle line.

I was in there before the airport shutdown and we were still getting very good discussion about the subject matter. Once the airport shutdown hit and r/HongKong went trending, then the whole place just became a shouting competition to see who could toe the free HK / fuck china rhetoric the loudest.. >You can condemn the protests without hoping for their economy to collapse just so that SG's economy can boom instead.

why not. The hongkies never did anything for us, and i feel nothing for them. They had their chance and squandered it. You underestimate my powaa. Agreed. When news broke out about violent protest. Many ppl thought it was propaganda by the CCP.

Turns out through stuff like these, it's hard to side them. I think our generation has less tolerance for violence. So from the moment that protestor lost her eye, things would escalate. If beforehand you already getting whacked left and right, you might be peaceful but for the HKers who started out with both sides peaceful, they probably just feel like they are matching the escalation from the police.. I agree. I was with then when they are about sitting in and engaging in civil disobedience. Now it is just chaotic violence.. Chan Yin-lam's case was a tragedy for sure. But her mother herself said that it was suicide. CCTV footage heavily suggested it was suicide.The HK subreddit demanded CCTV footage to be released in order to 'prove' that it was not a suicide. And when the footage came out, they refused to believe it.

That subreddit doesn't want evidence. Instead, they want anything and everything, even if it's speculative in nature, that falls in line with their agendas.. Lol. 'A very small subset'. Not what their online presence suggests. Have u been to r/HongKong or any media with a big protestor presence? See how welcoming they are of differing opinions. 

Sure police violence. But conveniently left out the rioters' violence. YoU MiGhT aS wElL tYpEd YoUr WhOlE rEsPoNsE LiKe ThIs because that is an accurate representation of your thought process in general.. Bruh what are you guys smoking over there in HK. Chan Yin-lam's own mother said that it was a suicide, and there is literally no evidence that it was anything more than that.

But that certainly didn't stop rampant conspiracy theories amongst the protesters that she was raped, murdered, and dumped into the sea by the HKPF. 

Complete fools. All of you.. It's very simple. Over here we judge by results. 

What does turning violent and rioting achieve ? What has china actually done to/for HK ? What is the situation in HK ?  What do you gain/lose from the riot movement ? What tangible outcomes are there ?

Ask yourselves alll these questions and it becomes clear what actions to take. 

One country uplifted the most amount of people, by the most amount , in the shortest time frame, in all of human history .

The other country was given back , and quickly descended into chaos and anarchy, striking at the source of HKs wealth and influence. 

You are building a whole movement on SenTimEnt and IdeoLogy and not on facts and sense.. I believe the same forces that influenced brexit and the trump presidency , are at hand in influencing perceptions on HK right now.

Few years back we were arguing about net neutrality. It's been proven now political opinions can be gamed and points shifted. Oh and it's the trump 2020 campaign next year, which also conveniently fits the us-china trade war , Huawei 5g, 1BR containment, Uighur etc news cycle.

It's started with the OSS under chomskys theory of manufacturing consent, to Hollywood, to NSA manipulation of data , and now to Cambridge Analytica. 

How else do you get a democratic populace to vote for and agree on unilateral war /action ? By labelling and denouncing your target as inhumane, evil, and yourself as a saviours and liberators.

I always scoff abit everytime china is painted as a totalitarian military industrial complex that is set out to subjugate the world while US is supposed to be some sort of captain america hero that is meant to save the world from tyrantsÔºå even though if you flip through the history books the US has been dropping bombs from the west to east and back again all the way since world war 2, replete with slavery and genocide before , while china has largely been a victim of western ambitions , and has just came out of what was known as China's century of humiliation. 

Furthermore if you look at their GDP spending, is actually mostly on infrastructure and social development works like the 1BR  - not military as is the US.

""If they can make you believe in absurdities, then they can commit you to atrocities"" - Voltaire. This is how the US has justified perpetual war around the world , and also the method they use to destablize and bully regimes that don't play their tune.. off the top of my head:
Hongkong land , Jardine Matheson. DBS and OCBC have some hongkong exposure as well. literal is ""fk ur mum"". but be careful, LKY later rise up from his grave. Oh no la they just said f*** your Mother ....and in the context of pm Lee it‚Äôs Mdm Kwa. Ahh there‚Äôs a misunderstanding, u/getmeagf thought this was mandarin before they edited their comment. u/getmeagf wasn‚Äôt originally referring to the script (‚ÄúChinese‚Äù). In any case, is this mandarin or cantonese? And is it written in traditional or simplified characters? Also what does it say?. I personally have to agree with our PM Lee at this point. Yes, all kinds of injustice have surfaced, and hence that reaction against that injustice. But, at this point in time I would have to say, the rioting is overboard. To me, it seems like it has gone beyond the initial aims of the protest. It feels like protesting for the sake of it. 

Why do I say so? The five demands, no matter how I see it, will not be met. China still sees Hong Kong as part of their territory. I understand why Hong Kong citizens want to see themselves as not China citizens, but politically Hong Kong is recognised as China. 

I support the aims of the protests. Universal sufferage! Independent commissions into the police, looking into everything that is done wrong! Withdraw the law that would make Hong Kong even more integrated with China! I understand all these, but I only support the aims. I do not think continued protests will solve anything. If anything, it has progressed to childish tantrums. Which is what PM Lee has pointed out. It only served to humiliate the government, showing their inability to rule. Lam will not bend, Xi will not bend. At the end of the day, only destroyed infrastructure. 

What makes you think Lam or Xi, or any of the legislators, will bend to the protestors if they haven't by now?

If the protestors are serious, they will have to be willing to pay a much heavier price on their side. The five demands are not going to be solved with protesting, with appealing to the US or Britain for help. They will have to be willing to pay the price themselves.. Lol humanitarian goals? Please stop lying to yourself that socio-economic factors aren‚Äôt the main drivers of the current protest. Years of influx of mainlanders driving prices of every goods/services up is a big problem for the locals. The initial peaceful marches are very admirable and can be seen as humanitarian. Now it isn‚Äôt. Only a fool will think it is.. Eh like it or not, because your movement is leaderless and the movement has a policy of supporting each other even if some protestors become rioters, the entire movement has to own the protestors who threaten violence or are violent.. I see you've been reading the rioters reading materials and talking points .

Those are all allegations and insinuations that have no real basis in reality. You are a victim of propaganda. 

The HKPF is recognized as one of the worlds best trained forces. That you believe they work with triads, run around and murder people indiscriminately at night , raping teens, tossing bodies off buildings and into the sea reveals how incredibly misinformed and naive you are. 

The fact is the 2018 human freedom index lists HK as 3rd freest in the world by political, individual and economic freedoms, after New Zealand and Switzerland. The US is no.17, Singapore is 20+. When people say HK is not free. I say bullshit. 

The truth is that you are a victim of propaganda ,  and am using ideology, lies and misinformation to justify violence and anarchy because you are unable to accept shifting roles and china's increasing prominence in the region. There is also a streak of cultural arrogance that prevents you from accepting other critical ideas and opinions, apart from your own. 

Look at your language. It's all subjective ideological rhetoric. Stop blaming us and others for having a different opinion, for quoting law, statistics, references and history. It's time for self introspection.. lmao WOT dmg 999999

>ut to ignore how these are reactions born out of desperation for the pain innocent people have had to suffer for our non-violence or the erosion of the rule of law by the police is to judge from a position of hateful prejudice

it's not hateful prejudice to enforce the law. it's called enforcing the law. 

>Like what you are doing now because you don't understand the full situation?

we definitely understand the full situation. i think the young protesting honkies are cherry picking the situations where there is ""police brutality"" and then painting it as though all the police are like that. If you honkies served in the armed forces/uniformed forces, you would know that the police have every right to shoot/attack you because you made them go through every rule of engagement before retaliating.

>it is the CCP and the police which are destroying the rule of law above and beyond what any protester has ever done.

when protesters start using bricks/hammers to attack the police, i think the police have every right to shoot back at the protesters. you invalidated your right from being shot/beaten up by the police by validating their right to self-defense as per rules of engagement.

You guys continue burning your city to the ground, you will lose out in the end. Your status as an autonomous region will end in 2047. It makes more sense to cooperate with China and reap economic benefits than to fight a losing cause. You aren't a sovereign nation, stop trying to become one.. r/HongKong  is that way üëâ. On the contrary, I think he has every reason to side with ccp on this issue.

First, mollifying China has its benefits for Singapore. The last time we raised Chinese irk, we got a not so subtle rebuke with the withheld terraxes. Since then, we are eager to get back into China's good books because China is close to  achieving, if it hasn't already, complete hegemony in Asia. 

Economically, Singapore is at risk of China's mercy. China is our largest trading partner and its tourists are the biggest spenders here every year.  On a more existential threat, Chinese sponsored ports in Thailand and Malaysia etc inches closer everyday to take our crown as the 'shipping hub of SEA'. Once the Belt and Road initiative takes off, Chinese influence in the region will be enormous. You can bet every SEA country will be vying for a piece of the pie, be it corparate financing, insurance services, dispute resolutions etc. Singapore will lose out if China blackballs us.

Militarily, the scales are even more skewed. No other Asian power can match up to China.

Previously, we can proclaim to be neutral among superpowers that be USA and China. But now, USA is headed by a clown with anti-globalist views and Asia countries can no longer rely on US presence here to balance Chinese assertiveness. See how Vietnam, Phillipines and Malaysia stop protesting China's maritime claims these few years just as US retreats from the region. Everyone is reading the terrain and hoping to end up favourably with the winner. 

Second, LHL and the PAP have personal interests in condemning the protesters, given how we view protests here as an existential threat to political stability.

So for all that reasons above, I am more surprised that he did not take a more assertive stance on the protestors. His tone and words are more moderated than I had expected.. Lol, let‚Äôs just shut our mouth on controversial topics. Props to your education/upbringing. >	He should have kept his mouth shut and said something non-statement statement about how we hope for a peaceful resolution and blah blah blah

So what extensive diplomatic experience did you have on the international stage that would make your advice worth a shit?. Please they want to overthrow the current govt. It may have started off with the extradition treaty it's more than that now. can sympathise ah, but we don't really care. 

>ut it doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy for people who lived free for decades to suddenly embrace their new overlords with a loving embrace.

when they started waving american/british flags and singing god save the queen/the star spangled banner, i lost sympathy for them.. >But it doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy for people who lived free for decades to suddenly embrace their new overlords with a loving embrace.

They only accept white overlords you mean. It's not as if they were allowed to vote under the British that they seem to worship so much.. I linked articles to support my comment.. Also, does this look like normal ROE to you?

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Please ^^send ^^me ^^a ^^message ^^if ^^I ^^am ^^acting ^^up.  ^^Click ^^[here]( ^^to ^^read ^^more ^^about ^^why ^^this ^^bot ^^exists.. Don't try it. A lot of people I know IRL seem to be under the impression that the protestors are just ruining public property and destroying their city for the sake of violence. But it's honestly much more than that.

I dunno if you and u/sec5 are aware, but the police escalated first through violent beatings, inflicting of wounds, and even collaboration with the triads. And the protestors target the MTR because the MTR management has deliberately shut down stations to trap protestors for the police to arrest them, shut down stations to hinder protestors' movements, and used their trains to efficiently ferry police to protest sites. And there was also the incident where the police are rumoured to have murdered people in a train station and the MTR refused to release CCTV footage of the incident.

You can google for 721 Yuen Long incident and 831 Prince Edward incident if you want to know more.

I don't agree with a lot of things the protestors have done, such as the way they target individuals like that JP Morgan employee. But with what I know of the protests, I still support the protestors over the ÈªëË≠¶ and the CCP. They have not lost that moral high ground yet.. Also they downvote any rare threads on that one guy who stabbed the police in the neck or the hurling of whatever objects into police station because it doesn't fit their narratives. Bunch of human trash.. There is written form of cantonese actually, example would be ‰πúÂïäÔºü  which means what?. Mandarin is one of many dialects, along with Cantonese. These are spoken, not written forms of communication. Chinese on the other hand, is the written form of the language, which is further split into traditional and simplified, with traditional being, well, more complicated in layman‚Äôs terms. There is no written form of cantonese because it doesn‚Äôt exist. 

Info dump aside, this is written in traditional chinese, and I can‚Äôt translate it because I can‚Äôt read traditional chinese, and even if this were in simplified chinese I probably couldn‚Äôt read it because my chinese is shit lol.. The reason why the movement is still going on and will likely go on indefinitely is because for the people of Hong Kong, it is not a matter of not wanting to be Chinese citizens or not wanting to be Chinese people. That is a narrative constantly pushed by CCP propaganda that we have painstakingly tried to correct time and time again. Rather, our people, since the 1950's have a history of being a bastion of human rights and refuge for Chinese dissidents fleeing from the Mainland and our entire society is based on this identity as the last Chinese city where rule of law, justice, and respect for humane values thrives. Now you can disagree with this identity if you want; I don't wish to get side-tracked debating it because it's besides the point.

The point is that my people see this conflict as an existential crisis. That's what I think you guys do not understand. Hong Kong people generally believe that if we lose this fight, the CCP, who has a history of abducting, torturing, and disappearing anyone who opposes them, even lawyers for merely taking cases against them, will destroy our people systematically. ""Today's Xinjiang, tomorrow's Hong Kong"" is one of our rallying cries because Hong Kong people genuinely see what's happened in Xinjiang as a fate we may share.

So to go back to your comment, I think in emphasizing the futility of our cause, you are missing the point. For Hong Kong people, to borrow from a concept in Sun Zi's *Art of War*, we believe we are on ""deadly ground"", it's either fight or die.

Those ""childish tantrums"" are the result of people enraged, once again, by innocent people we've known who have died under mysterious circumstances which are suspected to be attributed to the police, who, once again, never present ID to even government officials certifying that they are police and therefore are suspected to be PLA agents.

This is also the reason behind the need for a independent commission to investigate the police. Even if it is a futile request, it is a necessary request as part of legal proceedings. I think you need to step away from the idea that the police and the Hong Kong government is in clear cooperation with one another.

I know you might disagree with some points I've shared here, like whether or not Hong Kong is really in an existential crisis or if the HK police have gone rogue or not. I will probably have my hands tied debating this with others. However, my overarching point here in response to you isn't to argue about how true these things are but to simply clarify to you what the perspective in Hong Kong is regardless of whether you agree or not.. >Lol humanitarian goals? 

I was waiting for this. To this, I always ask, what makes you think you can speak for me, my friends, my family, and my colleagues what our motives are? The fact of the matter is that many of us are either refugees or offspring of refugees from the Great Famine and Cultural Revolution which wiped out tens of millions of our own people. Even those Hong Kongers who had not come in those days but earlier grew up watching the hellstorm that was the CCP's reign of terror. Our entire identity was built on the conviction that we are the last haven against their evil rule. Socio-economic factors? You do realize we have been protesting for decades right? Every year we have had at least one protest against the CCP, especially in 2014, in 2003, and yes, even in 1989 before the handover, regardless of our economy. Your entire comment betrays the fact that you do not know the first thing about our society or culture. We fight because we are the only people in all of China that still can. We fight for not just the millions lost in the Cultural Revolution, but for the thousands lost at Tiananmen Square in 1989, for the thousands more who have disappeared every year these past two decades, for the upwards of 1? 2? 3? million Uighurs who have been held in concentration camps since 2015 and the Tibetans who have been persecuted for how much longer. For the humanity of all Chinese people from Hong Kong to Beijing from Qingdao to Chengdu.

If you don't believe me on that or have never heard that these is the underlying sentiment behind our movement and believe in the narrative that we are either separatists, bitter over our economy, or both, you don't know the first thing about Hong Kong people or our movement. If you are not Hong Konger, what makes you think you know why we fight bettee than me? You are trying to claim you know our hearts and minds.. It's more complicated than that because in LIHKG, there are arguments which break out between the peaceful ÂíåÁêÜÈùû and the aggressive ÂãáÊ≠¶Ê¥æ over incidents of radicalism, and for individual incidents of violence, there have definitely been Hong Kong protesters who moved to stop the violence or apologized for them on the behalf of the ones responsible for it. I have done so as well before.

However, taking responsibility for specific cases of those in the movement where things have gone too far is a different situation than whenour people is confronted by blanket stereotyping, prejudice, and in some cases even hate speech for the actions of a minority of Hong Kong people.

All in all, I do think your point is a fair one regardless.. >The truth is that you are a victim of propaganda , and am using ideology, lies and misinformation to justify violence and anarchy because you are unable to accept shifting roles and china's increasing prominence in the region.

Let me ask you how do you know you are not the victim of propaganda instead? Because we have experienced all of these troubles first-hand and continue to experience them. Our views literally come not exclusively from media but because we actually know innocent loved ones who have been brutalized and because our forebearers, many of our grandparents were the ones who fled from the CCP.

But it is unclear what you think is misinformation and lies? The Uighur concentration camps? The Cultural Revolution? The Tiananmen Square massacre? Xi Jinping's War on Law? The fact mass censorship and state-run media is all that exists of journalism in the Mainland? Tell me which you consider the lie.

How do you know you are not the one who are the victim of propaganda? I have an answer to this question, but so we are on the same page, I would need to know which is the misinformation you are talking about.

>Stop blaming us and others for having a different opinion. It's time for self introspection.

If you read through the thread, I am not the one hurling slurs and abuse, and I did have one meaningful discussion with about the only individual who was willing to engage without unprovoked hostility. 

> When people say HK is not free. I say bullshit. 

Yes, Hong Kong is free, but is the rest of China free? Is Xinjiang free? Is Tibet free? That you think whether Hong Kong has been free is the issue shows you do not know what the movement is about.. >it's not hateful prejudice to enforce the law. it's called enforcing the law. 


Here is where your entire comment derails. The police are not enforcing the law. They openly collude with Triad criminals to indiscriminately assault civilians. The police, once again, do not present ID to even legislators and government officials when asked to prove that they are police. They have at times defied our courts and lawyers in regards to even legal proceedings. This is what I mean when I say you do not know the full situation.

Other than that, the rest of your comment comes across as sheer sociopathy.. üëà And r/Sino is this way. First, China cannot blackball everyone who simply keeps quiet about this matter. Given their geopolitical situation,  they cannot be too choosy with their friends. 

Secondly,  lets be factual. Our largest trading partner is actually the US. Our largest export destination is the US. And while their government is a mess,  their economy is still dominant and their military forms an important part of our security deterrent. 

Third,  your idea that the lesson we should learn from from illegal foreign coercion is that we should simply give in is incompatible with our national independence. I would very much doubt that you would be so welcoming if a non Chinese foreign power were to behave in this manner to us. The solution to bullies is to find ways to counter them. Respond in this uncalled for way only enboldens them and invites more illegal coercion. has it occurred to you that the reason LHL's statement is so circumspect is that he wishes to avoid this outcome. And about the terrexes,  think of all the development aid we have provided the prc over the years at enormous risk. We invested in them when no one else would.  All lhl ever did was make an oblique remark about following international law in a matter regarding asean, a fundamental national interest of ours. The lessons that is to be learned from this is that the ccp does not honour favours no matter how large.

 If you are going to make such a circumspect remark (because this is the only sane thing you can say),  and one that is still going to be subject to the perils of interpretation,  why say anything at all?

Edit: seeing as comments are now locked, I am throwing my reply to the comment below here because there are  matters of fact that need to be addressed. 

I said that his LHL's remark was circumspect. Not yours. Yes you are very clear about where you stand.

I lean opposition, but I respect LHL. I think he is mostly good, smart man who is trying his best having inherited a system that has flaws, problematic ideology and bad habits. 

You are right that we export more to the PRC, but US investment here greatly outweighs all of that.-- I got that mixed up. The US alone invests more money annually (244 billion) than the total value of our trade to the PRC and HK ( About 90billion USD combined) combined with ALL of Asia's investment into Singapore combined.  The US then buys something like USD 30 billion dollars of our goods. The over arching argument here is that far and away, the US is our largest economic partner. We should try to protect and expand our trade with the PRC, but we should not let the global times hype and racialist concerns blind us to the reality of our economic position. The PRC is operating in America's shadow.--Even here.

The point here is that the PRC is important, but it is not so important nor are we so powerless that we have to accept one sided, disadvantageous relationships with them. Furthermore, we are a multi-racial country surrounded by substantial non-chinese Neighbors who have various geopolitical issues with the PRC. Becoming too close to the PRC invites internal and external problems that are immediate and existential in nature. There is little point sucking up to the local town bully if that results in us getting killed in some other way.

 And LHL knows all this, which is why his statement is as we both agree, mostly neutral and even handed in context. And I think this that the logic that led to this is mostly correct, but the question I am asking is, would it not have been better to simply keep quiet or make some non substantive platitude? 

I think what you need to demonstrate is how much a more pro ccp statement would benefit us and how it outweighs the risks of harming our relations with the US. And remember, since we both agree that China is a short sighted, opportunistic, unreasonable and unreliable partner, we should absolutely consider this in our calculation.



"". Singapore doesn't want to offend the US, and get suckered into the dispute.. As a representative of Singapore,  he should absolutely do that if there is no compelling national interest. His job is to represent our national interest.  Not to make our pro ccp minority happy.. Given your comment  history I get that you are trying to be hostile for the sake of it.  If you can't see how obvious all this is,  then I can't help you. It should not need explanation that a) we have no compelling national interest in taking a side in public b) We cannot say anything substantive without one or both sides getting angry enough at us to harm our interests. I am very anti CCP and I still think we should stay out of all this. There were people on this sub predicting this very outcome as 24hrs ago. It simply does not take decades of extensive diplonatic experience to know  this.. Where did you get that info? No, the 5 demands remain..  Technically, there is a written form for the dialects.

There are different words/characters that are used for dialects. I guess I am a bit more familiar with the written Cantonese stuff, cos that is on a lot of Hong Kong media, and also some Malaysian magazines. Hokkien also use a different set of word/characters, which you can see in some Taiwanese shows. (I mean, even the written form of vulgarities in Hokkien would be different from the Chinese ones, even though they are mentioning the same 'things'.)

They are mostly the 'transcripts' of the spoken dialect, so for books or 'formal' newspaper articles from these regions still use the 'proper' written Chinese sentence structure. When Cantonese is 'transcribed' it will probably look like gibberish to someone who knows Chinese but doesn't understand Cantonese. But to Cantonese speakers, they will make perfect sense.

I can read both traditional and simplied, cos when I was young, I like to read Hong Kong comics and fiction books.. >	there is no written form of Cantonese

Oh I had no idea! But aren‚Äôt all non-Mandarin dialects written in the ‚ÄúMandarin‚Äù Chinese script? Like if the Latin script is used to write a variety of languages (English, Malay, Tagalog), surely there must be a singular Chinese script that is used to write the various dialects? If written forms of the non-Mandain dialects do not exist, then that‚Äôs news to me. Because I‚Äôve always assumed that Hokkien, Hakka, Teochew, and Cantonese use the Chinese script, whether it‚Äôs traditional or simplified.. >Hong Kong people generally believe that if we lose this fight, the CCP, who has a history of abducting, torturing, and disappearing anyone who opposes them, even lawyers for merely taking cases against them, will destroy our people systematically 

China need not lift a finger. The protesters are already destroying their own people systematically. First, destroy public infrastructure to ""make a statement"", all the while inconveniencing your own fellow working class countrymen. Block the airports and major roads so that the tourism economy plummets. Then, undermine the world's faith in the integrity of HK institutions by magnifying the police's mistakes. If the police deserve the ""brutality"" label, then the protesters certainly deserve to be called ""rioters"". Finally, the illegal mob persecution of any businesses/individuals deemed to be affiliated with China. The protesters have been admirably systematic to a c. 

> ""Today's Xinjiang, tomorrow's Hong Kong"" 

When the entire Xinjiang fiasco first happened, did HKers take to the streets to protest in the name of their fellow countrymen? The truth is , protesters are just trying to piggyback on Xinjiang human rights abuses to garner international sympathy for their cause. Otherwise, HKers wouldn't have given a shit about the Xinjiang folks. Stop trying to portray the protesters to be some sort of paragon.

>  the need for a independent commission to investigate the police 

Then do you agree that an independent commission should be set up to investigate and prosecute protesters who have participated in violence as well? I'm not sure if you've noticed, but demands #3 and #4 directly contradict each other. Investigate the corrupt police, but grant amnesty for violent protesters? Absolute hypocrisy here.. I mean, that is why I replied to your comment. I wanted to know the perspective of someone living in Hong Kong. Thank you very much for replying. 

Why I said these are childish tantrums, is because no matter how I see it, it is an appeal to higher powers to let some things go the way you want. A child is asking for a toy, that's why it flares a tantrum. But if the child is smart, he would try to persuade, or go earn it. 

Which goes on to your second point. Do you know what it means to be identified as a separate identity from the Mainland Chinese? It means, entirely separating from China itself. I agree, this is a fight for existentialism, which is why I made the point that Hong Kong is recognised as China. This protest is beyond just the 5 points, it is about Hong Kong as Hong Kong, as a bastion for Overseas Chinese. As am overseas Chinese myself, I can see it. 

But if the protestors are serious, it wouldn't be a protest, it would be a war for independence. Protests are no longer effective. They either work with the Central Government in Beijing to make it happen, or rebel and set up your own government, like how Taiwan has done. 

All the better if the police are rogue, as you have pointed out. If they are rogue, your point can be drawn better. Your aims can be achieved faster. But for now, protesting will get you nowhere. It only messes up Hong Kong, it does not go anywhere.. >bAsTiOn oF hUmAn RiGhTs

Bitch, please. Or should I say n-word, please? Since your progressive, human-rights loving fellow Hongkie rioters just called LBJ by that racial slur? Or attacked people on the street for the horrifying sin of speaking Mandarin?

Your rioter friends are intolerant, racist, right-wing reactionaries who do not tolerate the freedom of speech they so claim to champion. Your rioter pals also clearly forgot the numerous times when British security forces opened fire on strikes or protests during the time of British-occupied Hong Kong. You are painting a rosy picture of a time that never existed. 

So please, take the world's biggest *siu mai* and stuff it up where the sun doesn't shine instead of concern trolling here.. dkdc. pls continue rioting tyvm

>bastion of human rights and refuge for Chinese dissidents fleeing from the Mainland and our entire society is based on this identity as the last Chinese city where rule of law, justice, and respect for humane values thrives.

lol. all the chinese dissidents i know fk off to the west, not hong kong. hong kong is a jumping board. and you protesters dont respect humane values.

>Hong Kong people generally believe that if we lose this fight,

you lost the moment you started. how u gnna win against CCP lol.

>the CCP, who has a history of abducting, torturing, and disappearing anyone who opposes them

‰∏çÁàΩÔºåÁßªÊ∞ëÂíØ.  Remember, you are not a country, you are a specially administered REGION. you are not Hong Kong, Hong Kong, you are Hong Kong, PRC.

>we believe we are on ""deadly ground"", it's either fight or die.

ok good pls continue fighting.

>by innocent people we've known who have died under mysterious circumstances which are suspected to be attributed to the police

but when your ""innocents"" whack the police and bomb them its ok ah? double standards much?. >The fact of the matter is that many of us are either refugees or offspring of refugees from the Great Famine and Cultural Revolution which wiped out tens of millions of our own people.

my mother escaped the cultural revolution and immigrated to singapore. my ass most of the protesters are at least 2 generations away from the great famine/revolution. 

>For the humanity of all Chinese people from Hong Kong to Beijing from Qingdao to Chengdu.

very noble and admirable. But your protests have never garnered so much support before. It's only when the economy is in the shitters and young people have no hope for the future they are coming to support your cause.

It's a socio economic issue, not a ""great war against the evil CCP"". If the young people of HK have stable jobs and are able to get their own homes and start their own families, no one would bother supporting this.. > I always ask, what makes you think you can speak for me, my friends, my family, and my colleagues what our motives are? 

And who made you the spokesperson for all the protesters?

>The fact of the matter is that many of us are either refugees or offspring of refugees from the Great Famine and Cultural Revolution which wiped out tens of millions of our own people. Even those Hong Kongers who had not come in those days but earlier grew up watching the hellstorm that was the CCP's reign of terror. 

So are many of the overseas Chinese scattered around Southeast Asia. You are right, the CCP's history is tainted by a reign of terror in the 20th century. But you forget that China has come a long way.

I am no CCP-lover, but even I acknowledge that the government has, at the very least, been *effective* in securing a better quality of life for the average Chinese citizen (regrettably, this does not extend to the minorities). The CCP raised itself from a poverty rate of 88% in 1981 to 0.7% in 2015, over a span of 3 decades. Have you also seen the new, high-tech infrastructure in 1st and 2nd rate cities in China? Our politicians were drooling over its e-payment network not so long ago, when alipay/wepay have already been in place in China for years.

Meanwhile, *democratic, ex colonial* countries like India, Malaysia and the Philippines have yet to reach this level of advancement. So much for democracy being a hallmark of a successful country huh.. I'm not going to downvote you (I think it's wrong to hide dissenting opinions, which happens a lot in China/HK posts), but HK would've won a lot more allies from the Mainland/overseas Chinese if the message of the protests actually was something like ""Free China"". Instead, the current propaganda war plus historical/current discrimination against Mainland/Mandarin speakers make that message ring false. If HK didn't spend the last decade calling the Chinese locusts then there might've been much more support for the current protests from the 1.3 billion folks living next to you.. > The fact of the matter is that many of us are either refugees or offspring of refugees from the Great Famine and Cultural Revolution which wiped out tens of millions of our own people.

I would have to point out that this is slightly wrong. A lot of Singaporean Chinese here are here since even before the 1911 revolution. Even more are here after the break up of China following the 1911 revolution. 

I don't think this protest is going to work against the CCP. Even if you want to fight against the CCP for all these causes, you really need to think of other ways to address it with the CCP. 

I don't think overseas Chinese see the point of this fighting. The CCP won't move because of this protest, the lives of the Chinese in China won't change because of this protest, the lives of Chinese outside of China won't change. This protest has to be for Hong Kong, about Hong Kong. This comment only suggests that the protest has long lost its aims, and is now protesting in hopes of changing things that there are no ways of changing, or changing imaginary things that probably do not change.  

All in all, it probably better for you to stop with the protests, and not join in with the mess. There honestly is no point doing so, and will not benefit anyone, even the Chinese you are hoping to protect with your protesting.. > Your entire comment betrays the fact that you do not know the first thing about our society or culture. We fight because we are the only people in all of China that still can.

Lol. I'm pretty sure I've read more than you on HK/China history. Last I check, I still have a 15k word thesis on one of the protest in HK. But I'll reply more in depth later :). It's funny you blame the CCP for the famine and social disruption that exiled our forefathers when it's the west who came in and carved up China for themselves resulting in China's century of humiliation. 

We are the descendents of those who had to flee china for the social disruption caused by the west - you don't need to remind us - you guys got it good, we had it far worse esp with the Japanese invasion, racial tensions ,rape and killing of chinese etc.

 I really don't know what kind of history they teach you there, I guess it's the kind where the UK and the west is always the hero and the communists are always the baddies. 

The PR China government is responsible for the largest uplifting of the most amount of people, in the entire human history. They had a gdp per capita lower than Africa in the 50s to the worlds second strongest economy today . Credit where credit is due . 

Do you really think that China can be the worlds second strongest economy, if everyday chinese were not able to freely persue their livelihood ? Most of you even refuse to go to any Chinese cities today, nor learn to pick up the language , and instead prefer to think of them like some Maoist era North Korean analogue, when they clearly have modernized and in some areas , even beyond HK (like fintech, internet penetration , etc).

Meanwhile half of democratic India's population still can't even manage food security, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, etc ... We are overseas chinese with the same origin story, as you. You need to read up more about our turbulent history, instead of keep insinuating that we are ignorant and not knowledgable. 

The difference is that we have managed put aside our ideological, cultural, linguistical , national , historical differences to come together to build a nation , from scratch, without any major supporters like the UK and China which has featured so prominently and brought you so much wealth abd success. 

Meanwhile you keep insisting on ideology and partisan politics , all while your city literally burns. 

If the PR Chinese did not have the freedom to persue their livelihoods, they would not have been catapulted from a gdp less than Africa in the 60s to the worlds second strongest economy today. That you think PR Chinese citizens are not free, and are stuck in some sort of North Korean Maoist totalitarian dystopia , reveals your ignorance on what is actually happening in China.

Buy a plane ticket and go have a look see in China. I don't know this unfree China and evil CCP government that you are talking about. That is something you've invented yourselves to justify your ideological hate and anarchy.

Read up about the conflict in xinjiang (there's a wiki for it) or Tibet. Or the entire regional history of the area, like the Korean or Vietnam war. You don't understand radical islam like we do. I don't think you seem to know much about actual history apart from what's been fed to you by your rioters reading materials.

This stupid two dimensional 'china bad west good HK good' narrative is just inane af. Flip through the history books ffs. It's like your history books only start at 1997 and the UK and the west  is some sort of a holy saviour, and china is this evil imperial galactic empire. It reads like a fairy tale bedtime story than actual history.. >They have at times defied our courts and lawyers in regards to even legal proceedings. This is what I mean when I say you do not know the full situation.

double standards. why can protesters throw molotov cocktails at the police, bomb the police, use knives, hammers and bricks and try to kill the police. isn't assault against the law? Why do you guys still hide behind masks when it is illegal to assemble while wearing a face mask?

If you don't play by the rules, no one will sympathise with you. 

But then you'd say the rules are tilted against you. To that I'd say, too bad. Initially the tiny bit of rule breaking was fine. Then you lost all sympathy from us when you started bombing the police, waving british/american flags, wanting a western nation to save you blah blah 

You don't understand that all singaporean men have been through national service. We can sympathise with the police more than you because we were once soldiers/policemen/firefighters. And precisely because of that we understand the difficulties of doing their job. 

That's why i am okay if the police start shooting back and killing protesters in self-defense/or beating up protesters if they start throwing bombs at them. I totally endorse it. It's a pity that it has to come to this point, but it's totally necessary and justifiable. If you guys got shot by the police, you actually deserve it.. That's a claim not a fact. 

Your freedom of journalism means that your press prints whatever they like for profit or according to their ideology or political agenda rather than actual truthful objective reporting. Look at your news outlets it's a joke. Your news is printed sensationalism. 

You think that printing defamatory photos of Xi is a right, when what it actually does is inflame the society to prejudice and hate. 

You don't suffer from a lack of freedoms. You suffer from a lack of discipline and civility.

All I see on video are pictures of rioters causing havoc and police using appropriate force.

If you want to see real police brutality take a look at the French yellow vests movements and the LA Riots literally blood on the streets daily.. LMAO. Sure, because anyone who doesn't circlejerk along with you is automatically a pro-CCP wumao.

This is why HK protesters will always be seen as naive kids. Enjoy torching your own home to the ground while the rest of the world moves on with their lives.. Lol. 'let's be factual' right before stating an erroneous fact. Where did you get ur statistics? Last I check, USA is nowhere our largest trading partner, imports or exports. Our largest exports destinations are HK, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and USA, in that order.

Second, you can be as principled as you want to be. Ideally, no small state wants to capitulate to a larger power. Of course we are going to preach the wonders of international law etc etc but I hope you know that most of that is just lip service. This is the reason why the term realpolitik was coined. Smaller states will always bend to the wind of a superpower if they want to survive, much less prosper. The PAP, as much as you can criticise them for other failings, know this. You can stand steadfast to your ideals and risk your nation's wellbeing or bend slightly without compromising your sovereignty. The latter is what we are trying to do.

This is also the reason why LKY visited the grave of that Indonesian commando who bombed Mcdonald House despite very strong domestic displeasure. We know Indonesia is a power not to be underestimated and we had to put aside our pride as a nation to compromise and move ahead. You want to whine about how unreasonable China is. Yes, we all know that. Doesn't change the fact that they are a superpower and we are a small city state. 

And curious that you will end off with that remark, because I don't think my remark was circumspect in any way. I am very clear about my position.. Please go fly kite lah.

Do you really think that you are the only overseas Chinese in the region ? That only HK has a right to speak on those matters ? LKY has been speaking on HK matters way before LHL and has been speaking about it for greater audiences way before any HK leader has. 

Incredulous and pompous, partisan arrogance like this is why HK compounded her problems instead of solving them.. Has it ever occurred to you that his comments may be carefully phrased to position Singapore in a better light to China, because we are a tiny country and it would be smart to be best friends with the biggest kids at the playground?

But hey, I'm just speculating, because I was never a diplomat or an ambassador and my opinions on navigating the diplomatic corridors are insignificant.

So again, which big shot diplomat are you that your advice to LHL is worth more than a dead rat's fart? Still waiting for an answer.. Sorry, I did some digging and found out that there _is_ indeed a written form of cantonese, but it isn‚Äôt really prevalent. One of the common forms of written script is, in a crude sense without going into technicalities, the one you say in day to day life on signs and posters, with the other being traditional chinese. The dialects do use the same script, example being that given a text in traditional chinese(given that they can read), a mandarin speaker and a cantonese speaker would be able to verbalise the words, albeit in their different dialects.. >Then do you agree that an independent commission should be set up to investigate and prosecute protesters who have participated in violence as well? I'm not sure if you've noticed, but demands #3 and #4 directly contradict each other. Investigate the corrupt police, but grant amnesty for violent protesters? Absolute hypocrisy here.

The demand isn't the grant amnesty for all violent protesters, only to withdraw the generalized characterization of the entire movement as ""riots"" in official reports and media which is different from individual cases of criminal proceedings.

And asking for an independent commission to investigate and prosecute protesters make no sense because that already exists in the form of the normal criminal justice system.

>When the entire Xinjiang fiasco first happened, did HKers take to the streets to protest in the name of their fellow countrymen? The truth is , protesters are just trying to piggyback on Xinjiang human rights abuses to garner international sympathy for their cause. Otherwise, HKers wouldn't have given a shit about the Xinjiang folks. Stop trying to portray the protesters to be some sort of paragon.

This is simply false. First of all, we did in fact protest for Xinjiang. But aside from that, you and I both know very well that you jumped to the conclusion that ""Hong Kongers wouldnt have given a shit about the Xinjiang folks"" from bias and prejudice not empirical reasoning. You cannot possibly ascertain whether this is true or not without both getting to know Hong Kongers on a personal level. You could've trusted our word for it, of course, but you chose not to do that. But the reason why you chose is from bias and prejudice, not because you actually know us personally.

Otherwise, you're just repeating things I've already addressed throughout this thread, so please actually read through it.. >Since your progressive, human-rights loving fellow Hongkie rioters just called LBJ by that racial slur? Or attacked people on the street for the horrifying sin of speaking Mandarin?

I personally have not seen any case of Hong Kongers using a slur against LBJ out of rage, but if so, then I will apologize on their behalf. As I have said, I can and have taken responsibility for excesses by fellow protesters. 

However, this does not justify the extent of prejudicial hatred that you and other Redditors on this thread have been directing against Hong Kong people in this thread, which rather than engaging in civil discussion and debate, simply hurl slurs and vitriol instead. I know this is a clich√©, but two wrongs do not make a right, but by your comment, I don't believe you are interested in not doing wrong, only trying to make excuses for it.

With that having been said, I feel the need to correct you that it is a basic fact of Hong Kong electoral history that right-wing, socially conservative, and pro-corporatist parties always vote pro-Beijing whereas left-wing, socially progressive, ones have always voted pro-democrat. Some of the most prominent leaders of the movement, like Denise Ho, are LGBT activists, and we stand in solidarity with the Uighurs and Tibetans, who I should remind you are being persecuted by the CCP.

I can assure you that the vast majority of Hong Kong people I know do not hate Mainlanders for being Mainlanders although there is more of that noticeable prejudice from the generation between the 50's and the 70's. This bias is akin to that of a hypothetical scenario where Californians  distrust people from the US southern states undee the assumption that they're all Trump supporters. It is a distrust that stems from the anxiety that Mainlanders have been corrupted by the CCP into having no respect for humane values, and it has in turn been reinforced by wumao into a toxic cycle. But I have met a great deal of HK protesters who have worked hard to teach one another against this bias and not to generalize all Mainlanders. You can even find some in r/HongKong.

Finally, I don't know where that last comment about having a ""rosy picture of a time that never existed"" comes from. It seems to more of some ludicrous presumptions about what we think, like putting words in our mouth, that expose how little you know of our movement and societt. We don't idolize the colonial past. This is CCP propaganda which exaggerate the fact we see the CCP as a greater evil because by the millions of Chinese people they've killed in the history of their reign, and how their inhumane behavior still continues to this day with no sign of contrition, they are the enemy of today.. 

>It's a socio economic issue, not a ""great war against the evil CCP"". If the young people of HK have stable jobs and are able to get their own homes and start their own families, no one would bother supporting this.
I'm just going to point out simply this time how irrational it is to make such absolute certain assumptions about the motivations of people you don't even know while calling foul if they expressed their reasons that do not conform with your preconceived narrative.

Just because you yourself cannot fathom fighting for a cause if you are financially stable doesn't mean everyone else in the world are guided only by materialism.

That aside, many of the protesters have stable jobs. Most professors and lawyers support it. It is not just a young people's movement. People of all ages and professions are part of it.

>my mother escaped the cultural revolution and immigrated to singapore. my ass most of the protesters are at least 2 generations away from the great famine/revolution. 
But whereas Singapore was part of Malaysia, Hong Kong is after all, part of China, the Chinese civilization, right? We had front-row seats to calamities wrought by the CCP, and our entire society was built on the idea that we are the last haven against them. You can disagree with the soundness of this belief, but not being Hong Konger, it is not your place to say for us what we do or do not believe or what our identity and culture is. That would be the height of arrogance and irrationality, though it is what I have been witnessing again and again in this thread.. The PRC has only appeared to have made such spectacular growth because of how much they've destroyed their country in the first place. Had they been a humane government from the start and not killed off by some estimated 40 million people and stopped education for ten years, this sort of progress would have occurred much earlier. It would be insane to think that sort of devastation hadn't set back the country for decades. This is not to mention that the PRC continues to have a deplorable GDP per capita. We should not forget that South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan have all experienced explosive economic growth, with much higher GDP/capita, without the same level of gross human rights atrocities and catastrophic destruction. Let's even use the example of the success of Singapore which althougu known for its strict laws and governance, also have not ever committed the extent of mayhem the PRC has been wrecking to this very moment.

I am simply not convinced that China wouldn't have been even more prosperous and much sooner had it not been for the CCP. To praise them now, for getting to this point after all they've done, I do personally believe is a low bar.. >I'm pretty sure I've read more than you on HK/China history. 

I don't need to point out why this statement isn't rational, but stems from disdain and prejudice. If you intend to debate, you should begin with an attitude that doesn't expose your condescension and therefore bias.

>Last I check, I still have a 15k word thesis on one of the protest in HK.

And if your prior comment reflects this 15k word thesis, then it is already clear that it was erroneous. Again, you cannot know what I, my family, my friends, colleagues, and community think or feel. Only we can know that. This is what we are now arguing since you go down to motivations. How can you claim that my statement that economic issues is not a motivation for me personally is false? Only I am in the position to truly know my motivation and circumstances. By extension then, how can you claim that again for my friends and family? 

I shouldn't have to lay this out for you, yet you do not get it.. I didn't call you a pro-CCP wumao. You don't have to be one to fit in with r/Sino. Given your hatefulness, toxicity, and inability to approach this discussion with civility, reason, human decency, and respect, instead resorting straight to insults and flaming, I would say you very much do. If you disagree with me, you are welcome to engage in a constructive debate, but by your conduct, we both know that it is you who are displaying the mentality of a child.. I said none of those things. 

All I said is that  it is LHL's job is to represent  Singapore and our interests. Since this has clearly  triggered the heck out of you, one has to ask why you have a problem with  that? Also aren't you one of those perpetual whiner Chinese from Brunei or Malaysia who is here constantly pushing maximally authoritarian china model type policies in OUR domestic politics?. Then why so circumspect. If it is so smart to grovel before the PRC,  why the need for such timidity and care. His statements is only pro ccp if drawn out of context. 

My advice is supported by logic and facts. LHL behaviours behaviour demonstrates that he already agrees with most of it. 

Not only are your opinions insignificant,  they are not supported by logic, facts and it seems that no one with any degree of responsibility agrees with any of it.. ""asking for an independent commission to investigate and prosecute protesters make no sense because that already exists in the form of the normal criminal justice system"" 
then I'm afraid you don't quite understand the meaning of the word ""amnesty"". Please read through your own 5 demands carefully. Either that, or somehow your interpretation of the #4 demand is incongruent with that of your fellow HKers. 

""But aside from that, you and I both know very well that you jumped to the conclusion that ""Hong Kongers wouldnt have given a shit about the Xinjiang folks"" from bias and prejudice not empirical reasoning."" I'm afraid this ""knowledge"" is exclusive only to you, fortunately.

""You cannot possibly ascertain whether this is true or not without both getting to know Hong Kongers on a personal level."" So must I have walked on the streets and spoken to EVERY single citizen to ascertain this fact? This is simply impossible, just like how it is not possible for you to say that your views are representative of EVERY HK citizen. Funny how you think that it is acceptable for international supporters to take the words of Hkers at face value, but somehow it is a travesty for international critics to demand more facts/evidence to back up your claims. 

""You could've trusted our word for it, of course, but you chose not to do that."" Yes, because I prefer to investigate the facts rather than just take others' words at face value. To just ""trust your words for it"" will be truly mindless behaviour. 
How about you show ""empirical evidence"" that HKers truly cared for the Xinjiang dissidents before their abysmal predicament became a tool for the protests? Because I could not find any sources dating back to the 2014-2018 period (post-umbrella but pre-democracy) where HKers actually took to the streets to solely protest against China's treatment of the Uighers.

""You could've trusted our word for it, of course, but you chose not to do that."" This seems to be your only defense to the criticisms of the protests on this thread. You mean there is no ""empirical"", rational way to convince dissenting redditors other than claiming that we do not know the full picture because we are not HKers? 

""But the reason why you chose is from bias and prejudice"" I could say the same for you.. If y'all don't idolize your colonial past then please explain why y'all have been waving the American and British flags. I'm just curious.. i can definitely fathom fighting for a cause. I just find it very amusing to watch hong kong burn to the ground and watch you hongkies squirm.

I think you are misguided and naive to think that your fellow hongkies r fighting for ""freedom"" and ""liberty"". More likely they are fighting for jobs/cost of living/housing = i.e a future.. > Only we can know that. This is what we are now arguing since you go down to motivations. How can you claim that my statement that economic issues is not a motivation for me personally is false? Only I am in the position to truly know my motivation and circumstances. By extension then, how can you claim that again for my friends and family?
> 
> 

There's no prejudice or disdain. Its merely what you're saying that is amusing and erroneous. 

Similarly what makes you think you know what my HK friends, HK family, HK colleague and neighbours think or feel? What makes think you are fit to represent all the view of Hong Konger? Im not questioning your personal motivation. It may be humanitarian. But not how the recent months seem to be.. very easy to counter you honkies

1. you honestly think that rioting and destroying the MTR, random shops, ATMs will do anything for the people of hong kong? Why not go torch li ka shing's mansion and seize the land of the property developers whom have made housing so expensive in hong kong? 

2. do you honestly think that the chinese government needs hong kong more than you need them?. Right so your just spamming morality, hate and spite now because you couldn't get him to agree with you, and because you labelled him and can't take it fair in the face when he labels you back.

I think you guys really lack a proper and critical civil education. It's been fused with too much political ideology from your former UK colonists. 

You need to be more mature about this. 

The ideology of a government doesn't matter. It matters that the government delivers security and development for the country. 

What is happening now in HK is not the HK governments fault, it is the fault of you and others  like you who are promoting violence and anarchy, that is bringing HK and it's foreseeable future down . 

You are the ones who are destroying the decades of peace and development that once made HK world famous. So stop blaming us or China or anyone else. We aren't the ones burning your city down.. 

>	you are welcome to engage in a constructive debate

I would, if I cared enough. But I don't. I'm only entertained by the childishness of the protesters to threaten to burn Singaporean banks and consulate just because LHL does not blindly support them. 

Your time might be better off spent resting for more riots this coming weekend. 

Add oil! 5 demands! Glory to HK! Or whatever the latest rallying cry you guys got now.

p.s let's not pretend telling someone to go to r/Sino isn't implying they are CCP wumao. I'm sure you've been in the r/HongKong circlejerk long enough to be aware of the implication. >	So again, which big shot diplomat are you that your advice to LHL is worth more than a dead rat's fart?

üëÜ

Who are you? If you're not in MFA or at least PMO please stop talking nonsense and wasting both our time, ok thanks.. To be honest, I really disagreed with waving British and American flags when I first heard about it from Redditors like you. Pro-CCP people picked up on it long before it was even something most protesters were aware of or talked abour. But we have waved many other flags including the flags of the United Nations South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Portugal, France, Canada, Switzerland, India, the Philippines, and yes, Singapore as well. We do this as an appeal to international support, but just because we ask for support, it does not mean we are asking for military intervention or neo-colonization. The waving of flags of countries around the world is meant to demonstrate solidarity with the world. It is clear that CCP propaganda has been reporting exclusively on the waving of British and American flags to paint a particular narrative.. Precisely, the key problem is the quality of life, which is currently grealy hampered by the ridiculous cost of housing due to the HK billionares directly affecting the real estate policies and prices. You blame your government for your problems but my understanding is your members of the LegCo is somehwat influenced by this real estate billionares.

Why blame the LegCo and china when it is obvious these billionares are the main cause of your issues?. I literally didn't even insult him, he insulted and spewed abuse and slurs at me. I only laid it outirght the best an adult can: if he cannot engage in a civil discussion, then that is that.

As for the rest, by this point, you should just read my other comments, especially when I have already said repeatedly I don't condone violence and I also pointed out that even people in our government are aware that the HK police have gone rogue. In fact, your comment had no logical continuity to mine. The fact that you believe that people can only oppose the CCP if they have been brainwashed by the British is dismissive of the very real and natural human reaction people can have to traumas caused by the CCP. You dismiss that people who have suffered from the CCP can possibly oppose them if they weren't brainwashed by the British which is insanely illogical.. It's amazing the ideological acrobatics they will perform to try and justify arson, violence, destruction and chaos. 

It's a pity that they are channeling their youthful spirit and energy into senseless politics and violence.. On your P.S. point, it doesn't make sense because the people at r/Sino mostly aren't wumao. They are Overseas or Westernized Chinese diaspora. What also confuses me is that I would earnestly presume you agree with people from r/Sino, so not sure why my statement is wrong to you then. If you don't think you align with r/Sino, I'd be curious to know why.

There's also a difference between r/HongKong and r/Sino. At r/HongKong, we have had discussions condemning anti-Mainlander prejudice, any form of violence (moderators are also very strict on prohibiting any post which endorses violence), and have had fruitful, constructive debates with people who don't entirely agree with the movement.. [removed]. >we have waved many other flags  
>  
> just because we ask for support, it does not mean we are asking for military intervention or neo-colonization 

But do you know why the media singles out the waving of UK/US flags? Although you deny it, the facts show that the protesters are actually trying to get the legislation in US/UK to support their cause. Particularly, the HK Human Rights and Democracy Act bill in the US. Their waving of the flags of other countries are probably, as you rightly point out, symbolic at best - you don't see the protesters asking India to interfere in the same manner do you. The protesters have a serious agenda when they wave UK/US flags, and that is why the media picks up on these instances. It is REALLY not an issue of whether the media reporting it is pro-CCP or not. And the fact that you simply relegated it to a product of CCP propaganda is really just typical of the average *radical* redditor on r/HongKong.

>It is clear that CCP propaganda has been reporting exclusively on the waving of British and American flags to paint a particular narrative. 

Is it really CCP propaganda when international news outlets from even the UK/US like Times and The Guardian, report exclusively on the waving of UK/US flags? Don't think they have made significant mention of the protesters waving the flags of South Korea, Japan, Germany, Portugal... the list goes on. So you really think that Singaporeans here are recipients of CCP propaganda ? Really ? You think we only have CCTV 1 to 10 on our stations is it ? 

Come on. Are you really that misguided? I really experience shock everytime you guys push a narrative.

 And do you really think that we are so dumb as a society ?  That you know more about china and the west than we do ?  Even though we've spent our entire history balancing east and west as a nation , not to mention that the no. 1 and no. 2 spoken languages in Singaoore is english and mandarin respectively ? ... while you can't even speak a lick of fluent English or Mandarin in HK ? Eventhough youre a British colony and a PR Chinese SAR.. same reason why SG want HDB to continue appreciating forever

hongkies are greedy. they want to pwn themselves so they can profit off their property prices.. Because it's easier to hate others who are different than you , than to confront internal issues that are actually causing real problems.

Also the billionaires have bought them up wholesale. It's quite a feat actually how the protest leaders have actually managed to channel all their grievances onto China for their own political agenda, local or foreign.. Aiyo you fight us for what? Go out and continue protesting. It will go nowhere, and I'm sure in your hearts of hearts you know it.

The protests are making a statement, but realistically China will not cave.. Statistically the Chinese government has uplifted people both local and foreign far more than they have contributed to their suffering. 

Infact it is the largest development and uplifting of the most amount of people in the shortest span in all of human history. (From a gdp per capita worse than Africa in the 60s to the worlds second strongest economy)

Talk about freedom: There are 7 to 1 more US prisoners in for profit US prisons , per capita than China. 

That you think the Chinese government is this singular monolithic oppressive totalitarian government that is the primary source of all your problems , is proof of how two dimensional and flat , your thinking and understanding of real socio economical geopolitics is in the region.

Instead of coming from a basis of ideology and rhetoric. Why don't you use some statistics , numbers and outcomes in your understanding of Chinese and overseas Chinese history.. You commented that you detest the blanket statements made against the rioters because of a few radicals
Yet you generalised /r/Sino to discredit it
Sino has been gaining subs at a steady rate after each brigade and I believe this is due to the unadultered footage of the riots and violence that goes on behind it

People are being force fed peaceful protests, holding hands and waving flags
That is an avenue for them to see the true actions that hide behind the facade the western world is fed so often

You speak of the subreddit with such a negative connotation when in reality all they‚Äôve done is show another side of HK, less a few posters always posting pro communist views. Please compare r/HongKong and r/Singapore or any other national subreddits side by side to see that r/HongKong is an intolerant one-sided echo chamber of hate and spite that only accepts ideology. 

Fruitful constructive debates on r/HongKong ? That's the best joke I heard this month.. your discussions yield naught in reality. you can discuss till the cows come home and you will still be trying to kill the police.

I hope you guys stop rioting soon. You have nothing to gain from rioting.. üòÇ

OK bud. Glad you get to feel like a big man tonight.. The other news outlets have reported and shown the waving of other flags.

And welcoming support from US/UK legislation is not mutually exclusive as welcoming support from any other country. I didn't deny that. I said that we'd welcome any international support and don't necessarily want military intervention. Please read carefully because otherwise it's evident you are responding from passion, not reason. If India were enacting legislation to help us, that would be great. You're kind of just fishing for any sort of thing to refute, but you're really forcing it. 

In terms of radicalism, keep in mind that I'm about the only one on this thread, aside from that one user who genuinely asked me for my perspective even though we disagreed, who have affirmed that violence is bad, have preemptively apologized for any sort of racist comment a Hong Konger might have made to LBJ and said I can take responsibility on behalf of radical protesters even as a peaceful supporter of the movement, while you guys are all just spewing hatred, spite, toxicity, and abuse, even slurs, instead of engaging in civil dialogue. 

Whereas I have endeavored to try to address as many points as I can as earnestly as possible, you guys just keep on raging, even gleefully talking about killing us (when most of us have never attacked police or thrown Molotov cocktails or destroyed public property), and promote typical r/Sino false dichotomies that one cannot possibly criticize the CCP without being brainwashed by the British.

At one point, you should just recognize that you guys are the ones spreading hate. Even something as mundane as clarifying that we've actually waved other countries' flag gets you all riled up in a great fury, anxious to pounce at us as though you are the ones who have lost loved ones or are fighting to defend your people. I am not promoting hatred against any people here, and I have again, said I don't condone violence, and yet here you guys are, doing the opposite.. Okay, first of all comparing characterizing a subreddit as opposed to generalizing an entire group of people which number in the millions for the actions of a minority is not the same thing. The latter is the equivalent calling all Muslims terrorists because of Islamic extremists , or calling all black people inherently violent due to the issues of crime in black communities, or calling all Japanese savages because of WW2.

For that matter,  ""detest blanket statements made against the rioters because of a few radicals"" doesn't make sense. 1) I was taking issue with the characterization of HK people, most of whom are peaceful supporters of the movement. 2) Actual rioters would be radicals so your sentence has no logical congruence. 3) The fact you couldn't logically construct the statement you had probably meant to make ""blanket statements made against *protesters* because of a few *rioters* (or radicals)"" I think indicates the extent of bias since you probably couldn't bear to not ever refer to the protesters in any other way.

Going back to r/Sino, characterizing a subreddit is not the same thing as spreading hate speech and prejudice against an entire group of people like you guys are doing.

But r/Sino is a subreddit whose reasoning always boils down to a blanket rejection of all non-CCP media as ""Western"" and treats the word of CCP media as gospel. But real critical thinking isn't to be contrarian, but to be willing to gauge and weigh different perspectives, yet far too often people at r/Sino believe something is fake news for no other reason than that it is critical of the CCP. They also refuse to recognize that whereas non-CCP media can be adversarial against one another and are not monolithic, CCP state-run media is by definition state propaganda and this must be taken into account in its degree of trustworthiness. Their extremism is to the extent they argue that claims of the horrors of North Korea must all be false just because our ideas of it come from ""Western media"" rather than employing empirical reasoning.

I have read comments at r/Sino gleefully advocating for the assassination and wholesale slaughter of Hong Kong people all while calling us ""terrorists"" when we've never killed anyone and strictly prohibit inspiring violence in r/HongKong. I have read one post which presented a message by Hong Kong people expressly saying ""we stand against all acts of terrorism"", but the r/Sino user somehow took these precise words and told everyone that here, ""Hong Kongers basically admitted to being terrorists"". The extent of cognitive dissonance in that sub where something entirely opposite to their narrative can be twisted back and forcibly reinterpreted to fit it is insane.

It pushes out a lot of misinformation including in insisting that Hong Kong movement is fundamentally secessionist, that pro-democrats are alt-right when in fact left-wing social democratic parties are pro-democrat in Hong Kong and pro-corporatists and conservatives are all pro-Beijing, and finally in their inability to separate the CCP from China. Not to mention that r/Sino is the offspring of r/aznidentity, which hosts misogynists who claim to stand for Asian rights yet demonize and routinely use racial slurs against Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese, Singaporeans, Vietnamese, Hong Kongers, Uighurs, Tibetans, Mongolians, and Mainlanders who do not support the CCP.. Well I've certainly never lit or held a Molotov cocktail in my life nor attacked any police or public property in my life but whatever. ü§∑üèºüêÑ. Why would you welcome support from US or UK legislation? 

Okay, I have been observing your debate for the past hour or so, before deciding if I should help defend your viewpoint or not. I probably won't now. I don't think us Singaporeans are spreading hate, we don't see the point of asking other people for help. If you know our history, you would see that we have always relied on ourselves after independence. We don't ask people for help, we ask for cooperation. 

I also understand the viewpoints of some people here: the violent protestors attacking the police has led to a situation which any more protests would not solve anything. Some of us here were in the police and the military, we know how they work, and honestly I am sure a lot of them don't even want to be doing it. 

The Hong Kong government would not, and can not, back down. Protestors will have to step it up, or keep their game on. You want peaceful protests, that has proven not to work, its time to move on. You can do peaceful protests even till the next Central Committee meeting in China, till they have built their 11 aircraft carriers, and it won't change. 

What I see, is you picking fights here. Hope you would stop though, since what we see is Hong Kong slowly destroying themselves, and you as a representative is exactly what most of us see. Protestors slowly losing their focus on Hong Kong and thinking that they are protesting against the CCP for the whole world, when honestly most overseas Chinese would not have their lives changed even if this protest changed anything, much less everyone else in the world. 

Don't think most of us are spewing hatred, or spite. On the other hand, you are accusing us of doing that, and trying to play victim. It isn't working.. You were actually the exception I was referring to who had replied to me with civility even though we disagree, so I was certainly not accusing you. If you look at all the other users, they have constantly hurl slurs like ""Hongkie"" and slip in unprovoked insults at every comment. I have had many debates with pro-CCP people, even those who were Mainlanders, and even some of them were much better than this in their conduct.

Also, as for picking fights, I wish to point out that beyond my very first comment, I was not the one to initiate engagements with anyone else. I have simply been barraged with comments after comments by new Redditors.. Look, you are not getting anywhere while engaging them. Why are you wasting your time? You are clearly not here to acknowledge our perspectives, so why are we the ones going to acknowledge yours? Are you going to argue that your opinions are more correct, and that we are the ones who are not seeing things? 

We are commenting based on what we see, from a point of view outside of Hong Kong. There can be very different views, of course, and among all the different views, I noticed you going after those who are pro-China. Of course there are pro-China people in Singapore, and you going after them expecting for proper discourse, then going over to the Hong Kong subreddit and accusing us of being filled with hate and spite, is really disturbing. We can't see things from your perspective, but at the same time being third parties we do see why both parties are raging. You seem to have only addressed part of the argument. 

And of course, you have not answered my comments, even though I engaged you three times in a row. Which makes me believe, you are here to make a statement, and not here to understand the Singaporean viewpoint, are you?",18543.0,25,1,1
153,Wildlife in Singapore; Part 49: Sunbirds,djl96f,2019-10-18 09:56:54,"Hi r/singapore, this week I'll be covering a family of birds that has several representatives in Singapore, including some that are easily encountered in urban areas - the [sunbirds](

There are 145 known species of sunbirds, making up the family Nectariniidae. They are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros and Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, southern China, and South and Southeast Asia, with two species found as far as New Guinea, and one species present in the Solomon Islands and northern Australia. These are small birds that possess [thin, curved bills]( Males of many species have [colourful, iridescent plumage](, while females are [more drably coloured]( Due to very [similar coloration](, the [females]( of [different sunbird species]( can be quite challenging for novices to tell apart.

Sunbirds feed primarily [on nectar](, playing an important role in pollination. However, for some plant species, sunbirds may engage in nectar robbing, [piercing the base of the flower]( to access the nectar, without picking up or depositing any pollen. Sunbirds supplement their diet with [insects and spiders](, especially during nesting. Some species will consume [small fruits and seeds](

Sunbirds can be considered the African and Asian equivalent of the hummingbirds, which are endemic to the Americas. This is an example of convergent evolution, as sunbirds and hummingbirds are not closely related to each other, and are found in different parts of the world, but have independently evolved similar lifestyles. However, unlike hummingbirds, sunbirds can only [hover for short periods of time](, and usually prefer to feed while perching. Unfortunately, many people in Singapore seem unaware of the difference, and misidentify sunbirds as hummingbirds.

During the breeding season, sunbirds gather plant material, spider silk, and even [synthetic fibres](, building a [pendant, oval, or pear-shaped nest]( with [a side entrance]( that is [suspended from a thin branch]( or twig. Two to three eggs are laid, and [the young]( are fed with small insects and spiders until they fledge.

At least ten species of sunbirds have been [recorded in Singapore](, and I will cover them in follow-up comments.

Previous edition: [Mangrove Whistler](",57,0.89,11.0,"**[Olive-backed Sunbird]( (*Cinnyris jugularis*)** ([call](

The most common and widespread of the sunbirds in Singapore is the Olive-backed Sunbird. This is a species that is easily seen in various habitats, such as secondary forest and woodland, mangroves, abandoned plantations, parks and gardens, and urban areas. Many people don't notice these sunbirds visiting flowers to drink nectar, or flitting about among the trees, with their characteristic high-pitched tweeting.

In both sexes, the upperparts are olive-green, and the tip of the tail is white. The [adult male]( is easily recognised by his iridescent bluish-black forehead, throat, and upper beats, contrasting with bright yellow underparts. The [adult female]( lacks the iridescent plumage, but has a thin yellow brow and yellow underparts.

This species [readily builds its nest close to people](; breeding pairs will often [raise their young]( in potted plants, in garden shrubs, trees along the pavement, along common corridors, or in balconies and service yards, allowing people to [observe the entire process]( The nest is a [hanging purse-shaped structure](, usually attached to twigs and thin branches, although in urban settings, Olive-backed Sunbirds will use all sorts of [manmade structures](, and are [known]( to [nest]( in some very [unusual locations](

This species has a very broad range, including southern China, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and virtually all of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Sulawesi, Lesser Sunda, and Maluku Islands, all the way to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Queensland in Australia - it is the [only sunbird species present in Australia]( **[Brown-throated Sunbird]( (*Anthreptes malacensis*)** ([call](

The Brown-throated Sunbird is another very common species of sunbird in Singapore. Larger than the Olive-backed Sunbird, it too is widespread and easily seen in the same habitats - secondary forest and woodland, mangroves, abandoned plantations, and parks and gardens. It is also present in urban areas, although it does not seem to be as abundant in our neighbourhoods compared to its smaller counterpart.

For this species, the [adult male]( is yellow on the breast and belly, with an iridescent pinkish-brown throat, and glossy green and purple upperparts. The wings are brown, with a purple patch on the shoulder. The [adult female]( has olive-green upperparts and yellowish underparts, with a broken yellow eye-ring. The red eyes are a diagnostic trait of this species, and the bill is shorter and less curved than that of other local sunbird species.

Compared to the Olive-backed Sunbird, which has adapted to nesting close to people, the Brown-throated Sunbird's nest is a lot less conspicuous, and is usually [located high up in trees](

This species has a wide distribution across Southeast Asia, and its range includes Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, to the Philippines, Sulawesi, and Lesser Sunda Islands.

**[Crimson Sunbird]( (*Aethopyga siparaja*)** ([call]( 

This species is more typically seen in forest and woodland habitats and former plantations, although it can be found in some parks and gardens, especially where there are lots of flowering plants.

The [adult male]( Crimson Sunbird has a bright red head, mantle, throat, and upper breast, iridescent dark blue forehead and 'moustache', dark grey underside, yellow rump, and brownish-grey wings. The tail, which is longer than that of other local sunbirds, is dark purple. The [adult female](, on the other hand, is very drab; she has dull olive upperparts and pale yellow underparts.

The Crimson Sunbird is unofficially [Singapore's national bird](, based on a public poll that was conducted by the Nature Society (Singapore) in 2002. Another interesting fact about this species is that it was described in 1822 by none other than Sir Stamford Raffles.

This species is distributed from India and southern China to the Nicobar Islands, Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Sulawesi, and the Philippines.

**[Van Hasselt's Sunbird]( (*Leptocoma brasiliana*)** ([call](

This is another species that is more closely tied to forests and woodlands, although it can be encountered in some parks and gardens, especially when certain favoured plants [are flowering](

The [adult male]( has dark plumage, with a shiny green crown, iridescent purplish throat, and red breast and belly. In comparison, the [adult female]( has olive-brown upperparts and dull yellow underparts with an olive tinge to the throat and breast.

The Van Hasselt's Sunbird has an interesting taxonomic history; up until quite recently, it was typically been known in older references as the Purple-throated Sunbird, with the scientific name of *Leptocoma sperata* or *Nectarinia sperata*. However, it was determined that the Purple-throated Sunbird was [endemic to the Philippines](; the birds found elsewhere in Southeast Asia, although quite similar and closely related, were sufficiently distinct to be considered a separate species. And so an old name for this species was revived - Van Hasselt's Sunbird, named after Johan Conrad van Hasselt, a 19th century Dutch zoologist who was part of a scientific expedition in Java. The oldest scientific name available was *Leptocoma brasiliana*, which is unfortunate, because the person describing the species back in the late 18th century thought that the type specimen had come from Brazil, when it was actually Java.

While most sunbirds are sedentary, this species appears to migrate to some extent; although Van Hasselt's Sunbird  can be commonly encountered in some of our forests, the local population seems to practically disappear for several months every year once the breeding season is over. Back in the late 1980s, flocks of Van Hasselt's Sunbirds were seen flying northwards from the direction of St. John's Island, over Sentosa and Mount Faber. It's still not clear whether these sunbirds actually migrate, or simply disperse after breeding and keep a low profile.

This species is found from northeast India and Bangladesh to Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Sumatra, Borneo, and Java.

**[Copper-throated Sunbird]( (*Leptocoma calcostetha*)** ([call](

The Copper-throated Sunbird is a specialist that lives in mangroves and coastal forest and scrub, with most sightings taking place in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Pulau Ubin.

This is arguably one of the most attractive sunbirds in Singapore; the [adult male]( appears all dark in the shadows, but with good ambient lighting, its brilliance is revealed. The male has an iridescent green crown, shoulder patch, and an iridescent coppery-red throat and upper breast. This iridescence can be very difficult to capture in photographs. The [adult female](, on the other hand, is dark olive on upperparts and yellow on the underparts, with a greyish head, white throat, and an incomplete white eye-ring.

The Copper-throated Sunbird is found in southern Myanmar and Thailand, Cambodia, southern Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, and Palawan in the Philippines.. **Spiderhunters**

Some members of the sunbird family belonging to the genus *Arachnothera* are known as spiderhunters, although like other sunbirds, they are predominantly nectar feeders, and don't have any particular specialisations for feeding on spiders.

Spiderhunters can be differentiated from the other sunbirds by [their very long, slender bill](, and are also generally slightly larger than sunbirds. Unlike most sunbirds, male spiderhunters do not have colourful plumage, and look similar to females. Another way spiderhunters differ from other sunbirds is in the shape and structure of the nest; a spiderhunter pair will build a nest shaped like a trough or cup that is [attached to the underside of a large leaf](, anchored by plant fibres and spider silk threaded through holes made in the leaf.

**[Little Spiderhunter]( (*Arachnothera longirostra*)** ([call](

The Little Spiderhunter is another forest inhabitant, and can be found in the forests within and around the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve, as well as Bukit Batok Nature Park. Populations in Pulau Ubin and Botanic Gardens appear to have died out. In the forest, it is often seen visiting the flowers of plants like wild gingers and bananas.

This species [is recognised]( by having a grey head with a thin black 'moustache' stripe, and an incomplete thick white eye-ring. The upperparts are olive-green and the throat is white.

The Little Spiderhunter has a distribution that includes southern and northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra, Borneo, and Java.

**[Thick-billed Spiderhunter]( (*Arachnothera crassirostris*)** ([call](

This is a very rare resident species in Singapore that might be on the verge of extinction here. It was first recorded from a specimen collected in Jurong in 1920, but in more recent decades, has only been recorded a few times from the forests of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, with the most recent sighting taking place [in October 2007](

The Thick-billed Spiderhunter looks similar to the Little Spiderhunter, but [can be identified]( by its thicker bill (a feature difficult to see in the field), as well as subtle differences in the plumage, like the broken yellow eye-ring and greyish-olive throat and breast.

This species is also present in southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo.

**[Yellow-eared Spiderhunter]( (*Arachnothera chrysogenys*)** ([call](

Like the Thick-billed Spiderhunter, this too is a very rare resident of the forests of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Records outside of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve include a lone individual that was seen building a nest in Pulau Ubin in February and March 1998, and a possible sighting from Bukit Timah Nature Reserve in December 2005. The last sighting of the Yellow-eared Spiderhunter was [in November 2014](

This species is similar to another species of spiderhunter, the Spectacled Spiderhunter (see below), but [is distinguished]( by its relatively smaller size, proportionately longer, thinner bill, narrower yellow eye-ring and slightly larger yellow patch on its 'ears'.

The Yellow-eared Spiderhunter has a range that includes southern Myanmar and Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java.

**Locally extinct spiderhunters**

Two additional species of spiderhunter were historically recorded from Singapore, but have since gone extinct.

**[Spectacled Spiderhunter]( (*Arachnothera flavigaster*)** ([call](

There is only one record of this species in Singapore, a specimen collected from Pulau Ubin in August 1921. 

This is the largest member of the sunbird family, and is [recognised by features]( such as its relatively large size, robust shape, proportionately short thick broad-based bill, broad yellow eye-ring, and prominent isolated yellow patch on the 'ears'.

The Spectacled Spiderhunter is otherwise known from southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo.

**[Grey-breasted Spiderhunter]( (*Arachnothera modesta*)** ([call](

This species was reported as a resident in the Bukit Timah, Botanic Gardens, and Sime Road areas, but it was last recorded in 1949. Older references considered this a subspecies of *Arachnothera affinis*, but that species has been split;  *Arachnothera affinis*, now called the [Streaky-breasted Spiderhunter](, is native to Java, Bali, and Sabah and parts of Kalimantan on Borneo, while the populations in mainland Southeast Asia, Sumatra, and the rest of Borneo are sufficiently distinct to be classified as a distinct species, the Grey-breasted Spiderhunter.

The Grey-breasted Spiderhunter is [recognised by]( the distinctive combination of bright olive-green upperparts and paler olive-greyish underparts, with narrow dark streaks on the throat and breast.

The species occurs in southern Myanmar and Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Sarawak, Brunei, and Kalimantan in Borneo.. Is there a way for me to follow this series of posts?. I always see sunbirds in my area. Very cute nectar sucking. Just wondering if you know this: does Nparks use pesticides on the plants in singapore? How come there aren‚Äôt pests?. There are two more species of sunbird in Singapore that are considered very rare, one of which is considered to be a visitor, while the other is a resident that might already have become locally extinct.

**[Ruby-cheeked Sunbird]( (*Chalcoparia singalensis*)** ([call](

This species was listed as being present in Singapore up until 1923, although a lack of formal records and evidence meant that it was not included in subsequent checklists. However, a group of birdwatchers [spotted a female]( in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve in September 2005. Most recently, a female was seen at the Chek Jawa Boardwalk on Pulau Ubin [in March 2018]( This species is considered a very rare non-breeding visitor.

Both recent sightings were of [females](, which have a mostly greenish-olive upperside, pale orange-rufous throat and upper breast, and a yellow belly and vent; the [adult male]( is recognised by having a combination of a mostly iridescent dark green upperside, iridescent copper-red on the sides of the head, pale orange-rufous throat and upper breast, and a yellow belly and vent.

The Ruby-cheeked Sunbird is found in the northeastern Indian subcontinent, southern Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra, Borneo, and Java.

**[Plain Sunbird]( (*Anthreptes simplex*)** ([call](

This species is listed as a very rare resident here, but based on the lack of recent definite records, it might have already become locally extinct. At the same time however, there is not much verifiable evidence of the Plain Sunbird's occurrence in Singapore. A specimen was supposedly collected in Singapore in 1874, and it was included in a checklist of Singapore birds published in 1923. There were several unconfirmed records from MacRitchie Reservoir in the 1960s. An individual was suppposedly seen in the Senoko area in January 1986, before the site was developed; however, that sighting is contentious, and it has been argued that it was a misidentification. There is also an unconfirmed sighting from the Central Catchment Nature Reserve in January 2006.

Unlike other sunbird species, the Plain Sunbird does not have very obvious sexual dimorphism. The main difference between adult males and females is that the male has a [dark iridescent blue-green patch of feathers on the forehead](, and the female [does not]( This makes identification tricky, especially since it could be confused with the females and juveniles of other species of sunbird.

The Plain Sunbird is also present in southern Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo.

Apart from the Spectacled Spiderhunter and Grey-breasted Spiderhunter, we have one more species of sunbird that appears to have become locally extinct.

**[Purple-naped Sunbird]( (*Hypogramma hypogrammicum* / *Kurochkinegramma hypogrammicum*)** ([call](
Also known as **Purple-naped Spiderhunter (*Arachnothera hypogrammicum*)** 

This species was claimed to be common in wooded areas of Singapore up until the 1960s, but there have not been any definite recent sightings. An individual was reportedly seen on Pulau Tekong in July 1986, and one was supposedly spotted in the Sime Road area in March 2004, but both of these sightings could not be confirmed.

The sexes look quite similar; both have a plain greenish-olive upperside, and boldly-streaked underparts. However, the [adult male]( possesses iridescent blue plumage on his nape (back of the neck), rump, and upper feathers of the tail, which the [adult female]( lacks.

The taxonomy of this species has undergone a number of changes in recent years. In the 1960s, the Purple-naped Sunbird was considered so distinct that it was assigned to its own genus, *Hypogramma*, and the species was known as *Hypogramma hypogrammicum*. However, it turned out that *Hypogramma* had already been coined in the 1850s for a genus of moths. As a result, another genus, *Kurochkinegramma*, was created as a replacement, so the species was renamed *Kurochkinegramma hypogrammicum*.

Then in 2011, a paper [on the genetics of spiderhunters]( was published, with the unintended finding that based on mitochondrial DNA, the Purple-naped Sunbird belonged among the spiderhunters. This led to it being reclassified as a member of the genus *Arachnothera* (hence *Arachnothera hypogrammicum*), and the common name being changed to Purple-naped Spiderhunter. Despite this, the species possesses several unique features that set it apart from the other spiderhunters. A [more recent paper]( claims that while the Purple-naped Sunbird is the closest relative of the spiderhunters, it is still sufficiently distinct that the case can be made to retain it as a separate genus. Which is why today, you will see all three names being used.

The Purple-naped Sunbird's distribution includes Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo.. **Sunbird species present in Peninsular Malaysia**

We have one more species of sunbird that has supposedly been recorded in Singapore in the past, but its status is doubtful due to a lack of compelling evidence.

**[Red-throated Sunbird]( (*Anthreptes rhodolaemus*)** ([call](

A specimen was reportedly collected in Singapore in 1879, and it was included in the Singapore checklist in 1923. However, there have not been any recent records of this species, so its status here is doubtful, and it has not been included in more recent checklists.

This species bears a very close resemblance to its relative the Brown-throated Sunbird, but [adult males]( have a pale brick-red throat, maroon-red plumage on the sides of the head, and mostly chestnut-maroon wing feathers, with only a small metallic purple shoulder-patch. The [adult female]( Red-throated Sunbird also looks similar to the female Brown-throated Sunbird, but is considered to be plainer-faced, with a greyish-tinged and less prominent eye-ring, a greenish tinge to the sides of the breast, and generally less bright yellow underparts. The two species are usually separated by habitat preferences, since the Red-throated Sunbird prefers forests, while the Brown-throated Sunbird is usually seen in more open habitats such as woodlands, mangroves, and parks and gardens, although both species can overlap in forest edges.

The Red-throated Sunbird is native to southern Myanmar and Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo.

All the species of sunbird and spiderhunter I've mentioned so far occur in similar habitats on the other side of the Straits of Johor. There are four more members of the sunbird family that are present in Peninsular¬†Malaysia, but have never been recorded in Singapore.

**[Temminck's Sunbird]( (*Aethopyga temminckii*)** ([call](

This species is similar to the Crimson Sunbird, but the adult male has [more extensive scarlet plumage]( The [adult female]( bears a close resemblance to the female Crimson Sunbird, but it has yellowish-olive underparts and reddish-rufous fringes to its wing and tail feathers.

This is a species that occurs in forests of southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo.

**[Black-throated Sunbird]( (*Aethopyga saturata*)** ([call](

This species lives in highland areas. Adult males of the subspecies found in Peninsular Malaysia [are easily identified]( by having features such as a crown and tail that are iridescent dark purple-blue, a dark red mantle, a throat that appears black but turns iridescent purplish blue in good light, black upper breast with yellowish tips to feathers, pale yellow lower breast with light orange-scarlet streaks, and belly, flanks and vent that are greyish olive-green.

The [female]( on the other hand, is greyish, with a narrow pale yellow band on the rump (usually [only visible in flight](, and dull yellow underparts.

This species lives in the foothills and montane forests, from the Himalayas and southern China, to Myanmar, Thailand, and Indochina. An isolated population lives in the highlands of Peninsular Malaysia, and can be found in areas like Genting Highlands, Cameron Highlands, and Fraser‚Äôs Hill, and is found at higher elevations than other sunbirds.

**[Streaked Spiderhunter]( (*Arachnothera magna*)** ([call](

This species is [distinguished from other spiderhunters]( by having a heavily streaked head and body, with orange legs and feet. The base colour of upperside is yellowish-olive, while that of the underside is whitish.

In Peninsular Malaysia, this species is only found in the highlands, inhabiting areas like Genting Highlands, Cameron Highlands, and Fraser‚Äôs Hill. It is also present in the Himalayas, southern China, Myanmar, Thailand, and Indochina.

**[Long-billed Spiderhunter]( (*Arachnothera robusta*)** ([call](

The Long-billed Spiderhunter can be differentiated from other spiderhunters by a [very long, strongly downcurved bill](, uniformly coloured sides of the head, yellowish-olive throat and breast with faint dark streaks and yellow belly, while the underside of the tail is blackish, with white tips.

This species is native to forests of southern Myanmar and Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java.

The Black-throated Sunbird and Streaked Spiderhunter only occur in the highlands, so they are unlikely to appear here. However, the Red-throated Sunbird, Temminck's Sunbird, and Long-billed Spiderhunter are present in lowland forests of southern Johor, so there is a chance that strays could end up in Singapore. The two recent sightings of female Ruby-cheeked Sunbird in Singapore are also likely to represent visitors. As for the Plain Sunbird, Purple-naped Sunbird, Thick-billed Spiderhunter, Yellow-eared Spiderhunter, Spectacled Spiderhunter and Grey-breasted Spiderhunter, which are all either very rare or locally extinct, there is a chance that any recent or future records in Singapore will be of individuals wandering over from Johor, unless local breeding or other evidence of resident status can be verified.. I've seen (what i think are) artificial nests around the ground floor HDBs near my block - do the sunbirds decide to pop into pre-built housing?. Right now the best system I have is to click through to last week's edition, which is linked at the end of every new post.. I don't know if NParks uses pesticides or not, but if they do, I suppose they're applied sparingly and meant to target certain species; after all, it would be very bad if birds and butterflies ended up getting poisoned, or if the chemicals ended up in the reservoirs. I have seen various plants in parks and along the roadside being attacked by all sorts of insects, so it's likely that they aren't sprayed. Maybe we don't see very serious pest infestations because we still have predators and parasites that prevent these so-called pests from getting out of hand.

On the other hand, other organisations like say, town councils, condominium or building management, and individuals might not be so judicious in their use of pesticides.. Do you have a photo of these supposed artificial nests?

As far as I know, nest boxes cater to birds that nest in cavities and tree holes, which in the Singapore context would include birds like sparrows, mynas and starlings, kingfishers, and woodpeckers. They would not be suitable for sunbirds, or other birds that prefer to build their nests in trees and shrubs.",3509.0,6,343,1

-A Scot living in Singapore. Just a reminder that Scotland defeated the Current World Champions England last year so Singapore being able to win against them is a big deal. Noooo freakin way. Oh my god... :)  


Go Singapore \~ I will cheer for you over my country, Australia! :)  


See you in the MCG (I hope!).... Congrats guys! I can see cricket getting more popular in sg over the coming years. Would be great if more schools offered cricket as an option, right now most people don't know how cricket works to fully appreciate it. Noice; but there's just one thing, I noticed mahboob

Sorry I just had to :v. holy shit that‚Äôs amazing. Congrats to the team! For reference, what are the teams rankings?. Interesting, interesting! Keep it up!. MAJULAH. Invest more in this sport man we're actually good at it. Zimbabwe and Nepal whats next?. Congrats, Singapore! 
Always glad to see a newish team do well in cricket internationally. 

Hopefully you'll give us Indians a run for our money one day. 

Keep at it!. The game is actually complicated af I've been to India many times due to work and have tried to learn the rules of the game because that's about all they talk about there but still can't figure out how the game works. SINGAPORE STRONK

MORE MONEY TO THE CRICKET TEAM GAHMEN, YOU HEAR ME?!. Mahboob. Holy shit, that's awesome. Anyone know how to stream these qualifiers? Singapore's next game is on Sunday at 6pm, would like to check it out.. gg guys. As someone who is half Scottish and half Singaporean I am confused.. forget about fifa world cup, let us see our team in cricket world cup.!. So bloody awesome. hey that‚Äôs mahboob ur touching. Great job mah boob!. BEST OF LUCK and wish to see the flag in world cup !.. ...we have a cricket team?. does anyone really care about cricket in singapore?. our team all NRI become PR or local SG? Makes a big difference leh, just like the table tennis. Well done nonetheless!. I'd rather the government pump funds to back this cricket team with seemingly alot of potential, than the football team for gOaL2034 and I am a football fan.. Cheer for both, but cheer for SG for being the newbie!. Haha unique situation. Surely you should be familiar with disappointment now between rugby and Steve Clarke's NT?. Singapore playing at the freakin' MCG. Tears of joy.. Thought I was the only one. hahaha , the mah part is not pronounced the way u think it is though. the h is emphasied and pronounced as though you were trying to fog up a window with your breath (or smell your own breath), and Mahboob translates to 'loved' in arabic :P. Funnier to me because I have a friend named Amjad lmao. The format was T20 where Scotland is currently ranked #12 & Singapore is at #21. S. Scotland. It's actually pretty simple. 

You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out.

When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out. 

When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game. its very simple. watch some videos. its like a team scoring runs with limited balls. then the opponent team will chase the runs with limited balls. Noyoboob noob. Yes, and they have been in the news lately for defeating higher ranked teams like Zimbabwe and Nepal. 8 out of 15 players were born here or moved here at a very young age and have done or are doing their NS. What are you talking about. Even football players like Duric weren't local. The difference with the table tennis saga IMO is that many NRIs on the team are PRs who were born here or migrated during their school years. They weren't imported and given a fast track to citizenship to play a sport. They just happen to be immigrants who developed skills in the sport like any other young adult and qualified for the national team. It's a legitimate and organic process unlike buying and importing talent.. Same. Put the funds in sth we actually have the talent for.. Actually the cricket fraternity in Singapore is extremely well funded. Lots of rich expats contributing .. I actually agree tho. Once the gov see a team with potential like winning competitions against giants, before they win any huge tournaments should probably start pumping funds into it to grow the team further tbh. I mean, we‚Äôve pulled off one good result. Actual potential needs to be manifested over a pattern of good results, one could easily be a fluke. One can walk and chew gum at the same time.. Wait u mean these guys arent ""imported""?. No comment. Interesting! Mehboob means ""love/lover"" in Urdu too!. Ah, thanks.. Aha i remember that from Mind Your Language. I was on the cricket team back in JC -  the lone token local chinese + all indian born and bred scholars. Glad to see things have changed since then. Did Duric play for the national team?. I actually second this. We don't seem to have a solid policy on supporting our local sportsmen/women. Ever too often we see funds pouring in only after we have produced medals. Yet you see funds being wasted on more popular sports i.e. football. The irony.

For clarity, I'm a football fan and thankful for the growth of the sport locally. I would however like to see other sports get some level of attention/funding where it counts. Kudos to our cricket team!. *cough* Table tennis *cough*. *cough* table tennis *cough*
*cough* swimming *cough*. I don't quite agree with this. Support cricket, sure. But the government should promote all sports. The industry (aka sponsors) already funds whatever gives them more visibility. Look at India (the aforementioned giant), even with a billion people, the only sport they excel at internationally is cricket.. That is true to a large extend. However, most locals aren't exposed to the sport. Most of the time, people who know about cricket and play it are those who have migrated from countries who are good at it, like India, Pakistan, Australia, England and so on.

I feel that more can be done to reach out to the everyday Singaporean to get them interested and able to play cricket.. I see it as giving credit where credit is due. It is not about whether they need the funds or not.. Not true at all. You mean the government has unlimited funds allocated for sports?. Urdu has a lot of Arabic loan words.. Yes. I get where you are coming from. But a disproportionate amount of funds are channelled towards certain sports. Some of these sports yielded success ie table tennis. Others like football not so much. On the other hand, there are sports which are underfunded like sailing, cricket etc. Cricket in India grew without any help from the Government. Even today, the BCCI (Cricket's governing body in India) is not supported by the government.. Throwing money at a sport does not guarantee that it would grow well. If one is serious about improving sport, one should instead look at the foundations of the sport in fostering sustainable growth; not suggesting that one should gut one sport to fund another. Sports development is not a zero-sum game. I would hazard a guess that the Singapore cricket team have solid foundations in place to ensure that their talents develop well.

Also, calling for Singapore football to be defunded is probably one of the stupidest things a ""football fan"" can call for. [Singapore football has been living on reduced funding for some time now and it looks like the trend would continue.]( Blaming the Singapore National Team for not performing in spite of the ""funds pumped in by the Government"" is such a hollow, weak and lazy criticism. I suggest looking at the incompetent bureaucrats at FAS - case in point: [Sablon leaving FAS]( and the complete lack of effort to foster any sort of football culture.

With current structures, or rather the lack of them, it is very easy to blame and chastise the players. However, if one would stop to consider what [players have to go through](, maybe one might start to understand the systemic failures of the sport at the hands of the Government and FAS.. just curious anyway, if we go back far enough, 99% of singaporeans are descendants of foreign imports :D. Never said it was. I was merely pointing out what a nation's unfettered attention to one sport can do to other sports.. Go back *far* enough, and I‚Äôd say a good number of us were from the same group that walked together out of Africa!",1639.0,23,1,1
155,View from my window May 2019. Lightning caught throughout 3 hrs span. How do your pets react to thunder/lightning. Just curious.,djktm2,2019-10-18 09:05:45,notexthere,119,0.98,31.0,"He usually curses and swear while studying. My goldfish fainted and died. My dog immediately run and hide under my bed.. I have 2 lhasa apsos, sister has 1 shih tzu. Due to circumstances, all 3 now all live with my dad, who has his own lhasa apso. So total of four. 

The oldest one (mine) has always been afraid of thunder, but her coping mechanism is to find a corner and sleep it off. She passed the habit off to my second dog. Fine. 

My dad's dog used to cuddle up to my dad.

My sister's dog used to be indifferent to it.

I say used to, because now, all of them try to find a corner to sleep it off-- which my oldest dog hates. Why? Because the younger 3 cuddle up to her corner (she doesn't like this), and usually if it's a small space, they will literally dogpile on her (she hates this). Poor baby.. [split-second brightness]( Our family dog used to be super scared of thunder, the moment he detects a storm coming he'll look for us to carry him, and shiver non stop throughout the storm. Did that until about 6 years ago when he lost his memory due to illness. Passed away last sunday, this post asking about pets' reactions to thunder just kinda triggered some memories, sorry if this became dark all of a sudden.. I‚Äôm more curious what took you 5 months before uploading this?. My dogs don't even seem to notice, but my cat loves watching the rain on the sliding door.. My pet dragon is as smoky as it's always been.. told her about cancer and shit but she still lighting up... My pets become non-existent during a thunderstorm. Somehow they disappear to a place you can never find.... Isn't thunder and lightning really common in Singapore? I'd have thought that if they grew up here they'd be used to it.. Ah yes... mostly locking himself in his room most of the time too i believe.. Top ten anime deaths. OMG your goldfish fainted and drowned? Poor thing.... have u tried mouth to mouth resuscitation to save your goldfish?. LMFAOO. Has ur dog always re-acted like this even now, or did it get better?. Oh wow, its nice knowing they learn behaviors from each other. But at the same time, it seems like a double edge sword. They can learn the good and bad lol.. Exactly like a cloudy mid afternoon day view.. No, not at all. nothing to be sorry about and i'm sorry for your lost. Everyone deals with something differently. Its nice to let it out sometimes.

I'm asking in this post cause i'm just curious how other owners handle their pets in this situation.. I'm not sure what you mean? I posted this using Internet Explorer months ago.... Awesome... Have they always been like that? or did they get used to it?. Remind her to air out her room once in a while eh.... I know that feeling... Been trying to figure out how to get them to chill, treats dont even work.... Yes its common. But once awhile the sky just opens up and let everything lose. Like on that day in the clip.

I have always wanted to believe that they would get used to it, but seems like everyone i asked said their pets just go crazy from even a tiny weeny roar from the sky.. well its only move was splash.... Always like that.. should've waited 5 months to reply... I find the sound really calming! And the residential buildings here are really sturdy and barely seem affected at all which is really reassuring.

We didn't have thunderstorms often in Aus but a few times we had some monster ones. It was really scary because my apartment building was literally shaking with the thunder and my window walls were rattling non stop. All from a lovely 51 storeys up.. At least it aint lightning.... I actually do like watching it too, of course from a distance lol.

I cant imagine being that high up and feeling those shakes... and i believe those monster type are huge godzilla type and not this cookie monster storms here lol.",699.0,21,1,1
156,Pua Chu Kang the black face equivalent of Singapore??,djkrz2,2019-10-18 09:00:37,"Just now i was mindlessly surfing the net and i saw a video clip of Phua Chu Kang after reading some Justin Trudeau black face news.

It got me thinking what if the history take a wrong turn and Gurmit Singh was accused of racism/stereotyping/cultural appropriations and the script writer got fired or arrested.

If Phua Chu Kang did not exist back then will it become a controversy if it is created today. Is PCK the black face of Singapore?

Discuss.

Edit: Phua not Pua",0,0.28,18.0,"Gurmit Singh is ethnically part chinese though. Why black face? Did he alter his skin colour for the role?. yikes

no issue still wan stir. Op so woke. You so woke you got wokehei.. > Pua Chu Kang

Phua*. Lol i guess the benefit of having parents of different races is that you get to make fun of two races and no one can accuse you of being racist?. There are just too many ppl trying too hard to be politically correct and end up being easily offended instead. Michelle Chong‚Äôs Filipino character on the Noose is a better example. Punching up and punching down both are ways to create dissent , tensions and hate. 

I personally do not agree with any race(s) targeting another or other races(s).

Getting the correct race to portray the character appropriately is the best way which includes taking into considerations skin color, difference in culture.

I hope one day those racists could put aside race as a dividing factor and be more loving of other races.. The problem with Blackface is that people were laughing at the sterotype, rather than with. PCK is Singaporeans laughing at ourselves, which when the character was created, was actually very relatable at that time.   
Blackface is so controversial because of the widespread genocide and elitism that lingered. It is a representation of all the unfairness that happened rather just than the actual surfacial mocking.   
Then you have the well meaning masses that don't understand why Blackface is bad but draw surface links to other parodies and crucify them in a bid to be socially responsible.. Firstly, it's Phua Chu Kang. 

And 2ndly, generally it is acceptable to punch up but not to punch down. I'm not saying I like the idea, but this is just general consensus not just in SG but all around the globe. Personally Phua Chu Kang disgust me, especially when he was chosen to represent SG in the Amazing Race Asia. 

I'm like wtf is this the best icon of Singapore to showcase to the world?. I think Gurmit Singh‚Äôs mother is a Japanese, not Chinese.. Wokehei is best woke.. Thanks. Pretty much this. He‚Äôs pretty much as close to a national icon as you can get, whatever his true ethnicity. The Noose spares no one at all and it's literally a satire show in the first place so idk if anyone should be offended by it.. > I'm like wtf is this the best icon of Singapore to showcase to the world?

157,"86kg powered bicycle, over 4 times legal weight, among 27 latest PMD-related offences: LTA",djkgd8,2019-10-18 08:20:35,notexthere,38,0.9,13.0,"That's not even a PAB anymore, but an electric motorcycle.

No pedals.

The suspension isn't even a DH based fork, it's a frickin full blown combo of USD forks and the same sized twin rear shocks they use on the bloody RXZ and 17"" rims. All motorcycle parts.

This guy shouldn't even be charged based on PAB rules but rather the entire RTA book should be thrown at him for riding an unregistered motor vehicle, without a license and insurance on pavement.. I wouldn't want to imagine getting hit by an 86kg bicycle steamrolling down the street... 86kg?? That's the combined weight of my bicycle, and me! Wait... Is it? BRB, going to weigh myself holding up my bicycle.

Edit: actually my bike fully loaded with me on top is actually lighter. üò≤. Wtf that‚Äôs basically getting hit by a sledgehammer Jesus Christ. The owner, and the importer should be fined/jailed.. Motorised PMDs are flouting the rules in Park Connectors.

LTA should just introduce a 10-20cc class 2C license for them.. Just saw a motorcycle / PMD cruising along Upper Serangoon Road / Below the via duct near MRT. No helmet, wearing shorts + smoking.. I took my phone to take a picture (in the taxi) but the bike simply accelerated with the rest of the vehicles. Hopefully, police can catch these idiots with CC cameras.. Lmao is that the fucking JBL speaker on the dude's wrist. That‚Äôs an absolute unit.. Engineer here.

I bet this vehicle would be quite safe and have good stability on the road if it was decently set up with the appropriate trail and castor angle . Its a bit on the light side for a true motor cycle and would at the low end of what might be suitable for expressway use.-- you need a bit of weight to resist the buffetting. The rest depends on how fast thing thing could go.  I think that something along these lines is better for Singapore's with the right framework

In the US and Europe, they have a vehicle category for 'mopeds'. You typically need registration for these vehicles and cannot drive them on expressways. But you typically don't need a motorcycle license for them. Most jurisdictions require a far easier to obtain 'moped license' or some other easier to obtain license. This arrangement has worked quite well. These vehicles are usually far safer than riding a motorcycle and are not that much worse that driving a car.[]([\_safety/specialist/knowledge/poweredtwowheelers/safety\_of\_ptw\_s/moped\_and\_motorcycle\_fatality\_rates\_en](

I have always been in favor of moving away from the kick scooter type PMDs who are neither here nor there to favoring heavier types that are truly road legal. The pavement is fundamentally an unsafe place to be for any PMD, no matter how light.  As such the only solution to me is to make them light and slow enough to be safe for novices, accessible and versatile, while fast enough and heavy enough to be safe for our roads.   Here is a rough outline of what I think would be ideal:

\-There should be a weight and more importantly top speed limit. We should enforce this by implementing a limit on battery voltage as well as a speed governor. It would make it difficult to build a vehicle capable of excessive speed. This limit should be comparable with that a 50cc 2 stroke moped can achieve and be suitable for non expressway use. 45-55 km/h seem reasonable to me. An 8km/h speed limit on any sort of pavement applies. The idea is that the use of the pavement should be for taxiing the last 10 meters to your or your customer's doorstep. There is no incentive then to speed on pavement because you can go faster more safely on the road.

\-If they can fit inside that yellow box in MRT stations that limit luggage size when folded, and fall below a weight limit of say 50kg, we should allow people to take them on the MRT. ( but not buses). Same rules for HDB lifts can apply. This would relieve pressure on our bus system.

\-These vehicles should have number plate with bright and distinctive colours. This would aid visibility and also allow easy enforcement of regulations banning them from expressways and any road with a speed limit faster than 60 km/h. Insurance and helmets are mandatory.

\-A Cheaper, simpler version of the motorcycle license should be a created. We can throw out all the parking, expressway and other irrelevant sections of the highway code for them. Make it easier to pass by including only the  section relevant to riding safely on low speed roads. In line with the rest of the world, we should make the age limit for this 14 or 15. This would enable young drivers to gain experience and freedom so that if they ever decide to graduate to a car, they are safer, more confident and not so terrible.

\-We should encourage domestic innovation while up holding safety in this area by making the certification and testing of new vehicles and accessories accessible. We should promote a lively trade in this to support all of our local ah beng and ah lian engineers and technicians.  It would be fantastic if these people were allowed to make something for themselves and add to Singapore's engineering culture.. > # 86kg powered bicycle, over 4 times legal weight, among latest PMD-related offences: LTA

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî The authorities have picked up 27 offences related to personal mobility devices (PMDs) at Kallang Park Connector Network and Woodlands Waterfront Park, including a power-assisted bicycle (PAB) weighing almost 86kg ‚Äî more than four times the permissible weight for a public path.

> The offences were detected during enforcement action at on Sunday (Oct 13) and Monday by Land Transport Authority (LTA) officers and National Parks Board (NParks) officers, the LTA said in a statement on Facebook on Tuesday.

> The user of the power-assisted bicycle was in possession of an unregistered device, it added.

> For public paths, the maximum permissible weight for a PMD, including a PAB, is 20kg, while the maximum width is 70cm. The speed limit is 25km/h.

> The oversized bicycle had a tampered LTA approval seal and was fitted with a throttle, which makes it a non-compliant device, the authority added.

> Aside from devices which exceeded the weight limit, the other offenders were caught by the authorities because they were speeding, in possession of unregistered devices or using non-compliant devices.

> Three devices were also seized and impounded by the authorities, the LTA said.

> A spate of accidents including the death of 65-year-old cyclist Ong Bee Eng following a crash with a PMD rider last month have intensified public debate over the use of the devices on public paths, with some calling for a ban amid safety concerns.

> Earlier this month, Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary said in Parliament that the Government may have ‚Äúno choice‚Äù but to ban the use of PMDs completely from Singapore if the behaviour of PMD riders does not improve.

> He later elaborated that a ban on PMDs is not immediately necessary and the Transport Ministry will do ‚Äúwhat it takes‚Äù to keep footpaths safe.

158,An old lady asked me go to hell after me refusing to give her money.,djke4x,2019-10-18 08:12:48,"Long story short, I was happily having my lunch in a not so humid weather, then an old lady who is in her early 70s approached me and asked me if I have 20 cents to spare. I then said no. I questioned myself if that 20 cents meant a lot to me, then I turned around to look for that lady only to find out that someone already spared her the coins. Not long after that, she approached me again and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only asking for 20 cents, not $2000, ÂéªÊ≠ªË∑üÂ•Ω‚Äù WOW i was beyond stunned ****. What‚Äôs worse was that I kind of retaliated to her and said ‚Äú‰Ω†ÂéªÊ≠ªÂÖàÂï¶‚Äù. Also what‚Äôs worse than that is I should have just let that slide away since she‚Äôs already that old but Im just a human being who is not perfect :( I have feelings too :(

Anyways, happened at West Coast hawker. Be careful if you ever stumbled upon this lady.

Edit: The Chinese words mean ‚ÄúGo to hell better‚Äù then I replied ‚Äúyou go to hell first‚Äù",303,0.93,90.0,"its ok la she already going before u already..... actually,  i see nothing wrong in this and its not about the value or amount. 

OP not sparing $xx amount is because its OPs property. its not about the value. 
while OP is kind enough to spare a thought,  it is still OPs decision. 
whereas these self entitled people are at fault,  it sums it up when she cursed OP after she achieve her goal.. I think fair game leh. If you didn‚Äôt insult her or anything and she swore at you why can‚Äôt you swear back? Not as if you physically retaliated.... Walks out of supermart. Beggar asked for cigarettes and money. Says I don‚Äôt smoke and no, I‚Äôm a poor student and have no spare cash. Received a ‚Äúf*** you‚Äù. Smiled, replied a thank you and walked off. 

Self entitled lowlifes will not thank you for anything and will curse at you if you do not give. So why bother getting affected by their rude gesture? Stay happy, if you 20cent more in your pocket.. Translation pls :(. Suggestion: when dealing with much older humans who piss you off, just say stuff like ""you're going to die soon anyway"" or its variants. It's statistically true right?. Why does being old exempt them from criticism? No reason to wayang to grannies with 1 foot in the grave and the other foot in debt. No need feel bad la. She lucky u nvr spit at her. She's just like one of those self entitled peeps (regardless of race, age) who jump the queue at the bus interchange.

There are many such people out there nowadays.

They are quite prideful in their behavior and believes that the whole world ought to give in to them since they're presumably special.. OP, I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong. Being old doesn‚Äôt mean someone cannot be malicious. And there is no reason why you should be subject to unprovoked abuse.. r/AmItheAsshole. Few years back i give money to an old lady, 1 hour later i saw her queuing at Singaporepools.. i whisper to her, ""aunty ‰∏≠‰∫ÜË¶ÅÂàÜÊàë‰∏ÄÁÇπÂì¶„ÄÇ"". Same thing kinda happened to me earlier last month.

Walks to coffee shop to buy my daily Kopi-O ice going home. One 80(i think) year old uncle stops me and ask if I had coins , specifically $1.70. 

I told him i just used up my coin for my kopi-o , might have only 10 or 20 cents. 

Indeed only had 30 cents. Gave it to him.

The fking shock of my life was when he said in hokkien '30 cents where got enough, give me ur $2 note'

I walked away to the toilet. While washing my hand i felt ' what if he needed to eat' so i prepared the $2 to give him, walked the coffeeshop to find him.

He was sitting down at a table, with a Tiger infront of him, just opened. 

Continue to sip my Kopi-o Ice and went home. Similar incident at orchard 

Lady asks for $5-10 

I ask what for 


Food she says 



Ok I'll buy for you,pointing to breadtalk 


She walks away...... Was walking to MRT station the other day when an uncle targeted us and asked if we could spare exactly $2.80 so he could take bus home. We didn't have change so awkwardly said no and were told that ""young people nowadays not nice, don't want to help out a poor old man"" uhhhhhhh....... out of sight out of mind. I would have replied ""ÁªôÁãóÈÉΩ‰∏çÁªô‰Ω†‚Äú. HAHAHAHAHAH your response was the cherry on top. Good job man. Should have replied with ‰Ω†ÂÖàÂéªÂêß. Have no fear, tell all these entitled pos to fuck off. I think you used the wrong gen it should be Êõ¥. After she said that, you should have pretended to take out your wallet to give her money but put it back in your wallet after she reached for it.. How to express the sentiment ""so old, character still so terrible, utterly disgraceful and shameful"" in chinese? Should have a saying or chengyu for that right? Like those type of moral shaming kind of things.. this is why i rather lose the coins in the washing machine than to give a  homosapien. The lady was being unreasonable. Just because she's old doesn't mean she gets to insult anyone who is younger than her. And just because she's old doesn't mean we have to give in to her every request. Zzz old people who think young ones are rude when they themselves are the rude ones.. Nobody has a right to any one else‚Äôs money or charity.. Sorry bro, cashless only. You got PayNow?. geng not gen. This story made me remember an incident I had a few years back at FoodCourt in Wisma Atria.

An auntie was asking for loose change and I took out $2 and she told me $2 gets nothing here.

I gave her the $2 and told her if u want it its yours I couldn't care less if u can eat with it or not.. Just say Êó©Ê≠ªÊó©Ë∂ÖÁîü„ÄÇlmao.. Forget it. She will get there first. Pursue the 20 cent case and the chances of you getting there first increase d.. Suggest OP not to watch Drag Me To Hell after this.. If you lived 70 years in Singapore and still have to go around and beg for change, that's a very sad life that is worse then death. With that quality of life, what's the point of living?. What i do is when they come over and ask for spare change/buy keychain/buy toto ticket/free cigarettes, i just ignore them.   

I won't even look at them. Usually after a few seconds, they'll move on to the next table.. R/entitledpeople. ‰Ω†Ë¶ÅÈí±ÔºåÊàëÂ∞±ÁÉßÂÜ•Â∏ÅÁªô‰Ω†lor, Ë¶Å‰∏çË¶ÅÔºü. a 50 yrs old plus woman come to my shop at Far east plaza and sell tissues.i rejected her but she keep pestering me so i ask ,you open yr bag let me see how much money in it and she just walk away lol.. At 70, it won't be too long to the road to hell for her.. Dang I like going to West Coast hawker center D:. There are lots of nice beggars in London, and will come up to you all polite to ask ""can you spare 20p"" and will smilingly walk away if you say no. From my understanding many people do not give change to such people because they can certainly work. Others suggest that these people simply feed a drug or alcohol habit, hence it is better not to be a part of it. Some say that it is an easy way to get money without being responsible. As tough as it is in Singapore, people with genuine need for help can get help. 

In a previous life, I believed that it takes courage to beg, and I used to give money anytime someone asked for it. But I soon realised that courage can be easily displaced by ambivalence, laziness and a sense of entitlement. By asking for only 20cents the lady is presenting a gambit, cause you will not only give 20 cents but much more. If you only gave 20 cents it would look pathetic, particularly when you have people watching you. 

There are so many temples, mosques and churches that help so many people even when they have failed to receive help from the govt. While I may be critical of this selfish government for some things, i do give credit where credit is due. The govt has in place several initiatives that can render significant assistance through the Family Service Centres and  even the self-help groups like CDAC, Mendaki and SINDA. For these reasons, I would never offer money to anyone. And when I do offer, i make sure that the amount is meaningful enough to buy a proper meal.

It is like feeding pigeons at the park, or monkeys at McRitchie. You think you are doing them some good, but in actual fact, you creating dependency, and those birds and simians will never learn to fend for themselves.. Aunty you help me scout there first can. Then I sixpool after you. Some of the curses here are so brutal. r/iamgoingtohellforthis. Â∞ç‰∏çËµ∑ÔºåÊòéÂ§©Âú®ÈÄôË£°ÊàëÁµ¶‰Ω†‰∏ÄÂçÉËê¨Ôºå Âä†ÂÖ©ÂÄãÂÉï‰∫∫ Âíå‰∏ÄÊ£üÊàøÂ≠ê.

 r/singapore so bo liao alr. 

macam becoming stomp fifteen twenty years ago.. an elder cusses at you.

&#x200B;

you cuss her back.

&#x200B;

you then come online to share the story hoping that you can garner support for your behaviour.. Man it's only 20 cents... Swallow a 20 cent coin in front of her. Imagine wasting ur life thinking about 20 cents and write a post about it. Either be hard ass about it or dont. But dont be thinking you‚Äôre hard ass and come here complaining when the lady is harder than you.. And you came to Reddit / SG ?. It‚Äôs only 20 cents lol you deserve it. In hell 'oh hi there'. Just a little push to accelerate the process. you cant be too sure about that.. Exactly. She got the money, but remains to be bitter at OP. Why make things difficult? You got what you wanted right??? The old lady shouldn't blame anyone and reflect on this unruly behavior.. Replying thank you to fuck you is a whole other level of Zen. Congrats. Basically cursing the OP to 'die' or 'go and die'..

> SINGAPORE - The High Court has quashed the conviction of a psychiatrist who was hauled to court for providing information on his patient to a man claiming to be her husband.

> In a judgment issued on Friday (Oct 18), Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said that the charge of professional misconduct against Dr Soo Shuenn Chiang for failing to maintain a patient's medical confidentiality was not made out.

> The Chief Justice said a doctor may disclose a patient's confidential medical information without her consent when he reasonably regards it as necessary to protect the patient from potentially serious self-harm, the disclosure is in the patient's best interests and the patient's consent cannot reasonably be obtained.

> In such circumstances, the disclosure should be made to those closest to the patient, such as her next of kin, the Chief Justice noted.

> The decision on Friday came after the Singapore Medical Council applied to the Court of Three Judges in May to quash the conviction and $50,000 fine against Dr Soo, a psychiatrist at the National University Hospital.

> He had been charged with giving a memo on a patient's medical condition to her brother, who had posed as her husband.

> The patient filed a complaint with the council, saying that her brother used the memo provided by the doctor to get a protection order against her in a family court.

> The patient's brother later put online his version of what happened. He said in his Facebook post that while he spoke to the doctor, the patient's husband was with him and agreed with what he was doing.

Assuming the brother is speaking the truth, it may be that the husband is agreeable but doesn't want to be the one that pulls the trigger so the brother did that. 

But tbh, if the brother is seeking PPO against her I think she's kinda on the deep end, which is also why this portion may be relevant: 

>The Chief Justice said a doctor may disclose a patient's confidential medical information without her consent when he reasonably regards it as necessary to protect the patient from potentially serious self-harm, the disclosure is in the patient's best interests and the patient's consent cannot reasonably be obtained.. There was a complaint with SMC and there was also a Police report lodged by the patient. Therefore there must be fair amount of investigation undertaken. My guess is that things were done with good intentions and to protect the patient from herself. Hence no further action against the brother and husband.

Justice is also served that CJ quashed the sentences.

This is the second recent case where the medical fraternity exploded when the first outcome came to be known. This forced SMC to go to courts to save their arse. On both cases the doctors pleaded guilty. I suppose the long wait endured was not worth it. It tells us that justice must be swift. 

It is about time that SMC interdisciplinary process be overhauled and someone in there a common sense smell test be ticked off before a sentence is passed.

You would think a collective of high performing intellectuals can marshal their own.. hes a nice guy haha. These kind of case also quite mild tbh, he was prolly advised to pay the fine and move on. Hight court has the opinion he should have fought it.

 The real issue is how SMC straightup went for censuring the doctor without even getting the facts right, or bothering to do a proper investigation.  And the DT agreed with it... so many levels of fuck-ups.. This is the only sensible outcome. SMC prosecutions have been terrible as of late. And when the DT does convict, its always slap on the wrist punishments for clearly dishonest doctors.",887.0,13,1,1

> WASHINGTON - Countries have taken too seriously the expected boost in pay that college graduates get over their non-college educated peers, despite the bottom quarter of graduates not earning this ""college premium"" in reality, said Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam at an economics conference on Thursday (Oct 17).

> This focus on pushing high school graduates into universities has also led to a massive mismatch between people's abilities and the needs of the marketplace, said Mr Tharman, who called for a greater focus on vocational education in advanced economies.

> He was speaking at a conference on reducing inequality in advanced economies organised by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington DC, where he will be attending annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund until Sunday.

> ""We've been taking too seriously the college premium,"" said Mr Tharman at a panel discussion on education, noting that the college premium was actually an average, not a standard amount that all graduates could expect.

> ""It's always been the case, going back to the 1970s, that the bottom 25 per cent (of college grads) has hardly any premium over a high school grad. By pushing someone who's a high school grad into college, you don't get him or her to earn a college premium that's based on the average. It's always a marginal issue,"" said Mr Tharman, who is also Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and was Education Minister from 2003 to 2008.

> In the United States, 40 per cent of people who enrol in universities do not even complete within six years, he said. A substantial proportion of those who graduate end up in jobs that do not require a college degree, he added, calling the phenomenon a ""massive mismatch of abilities and the needs of the marketplace"".

> ""The question is not should you be a high school grad or should you be a college grad and hope to earn the average college premium. The question is, what form of post high-school education will give you a premium?"" said Mr Tharman.

> Addressing this requires a greater focus on vocational education, which is another way to develop soft skills such as creativity, teamwork and cross-cultural skills in people, said Mr Tharman.

> ""The writing is on the wall. We have trundled into an overwhelmingly academically oriented college education and we need a rebalancing,"" he said.

> The senior minister recounted how he had observed young people in overseas labs and training workshops, for instance, learning to adapt to something never seen before.

> ""It's different from reading a new novel. It develops a different set of instincts and skills,"" he said. ""Yes, we've got to develop people so they can keep adapting to change throughout their lives. Doing it through an applied education is not necessarily inferior to the typical liberal arts model.""

> Market intermediaries can also change hiring practices to focus more on applicants' skills and not pedigree, he said.

> He gave the example of Silicon Valley start-up GapJumpers, which has developed a system of blind auditions that lets companies upload skills challenges online and call the top scorers for interviews, all without knowing their social or educational background.

> ""We've got to think of all these new forms of intermediaries, first to reduce the social biases of hiring marketplace and secondly match skills supply and demand better than we're doing today,"" he said.

> In his remarks, Mr Tharman also strongly championed public school systems of the sort found in Singapore and Finland, over the decentralised education systems of the United States and elsewhere.

> The US, for instance, leaves aspects of funding, curriculum and teacher training to states and school districts, instead of having them all set by the national government.

> Much of what ails decentralised education systems is that too much has been left to the social and economic marketplace, which practices social engineering, said Mr Tharman.

> This starts with the increasing trend of people marrying others of similar educational background, he said.

> The best-educated and better-off parents also invest more into their children's education and enrichment compared to median and lower-income parents, a trend sharply on the rise in the last 20 to 30 years.

> Schools are also shaped by the neighbourhoods they are in, which are becoming increasingly different, he said, adding that these situations can be seen in the US and United Kingdom, for instance.

> Said Mr Tharman: ""We're not any longer sure that meritocratic education systems are going to be able to blunt the advantages or disadvantages that kids bring with them from the home and from their social backgrounds in the same way they did at some point in the past in many countries.""

> Technological change has also prompted serious concerns everywhere in the world about whether current education systems can prepare a broad spectrum of young people well for a new era of jobs and work, he said.

> ""If we continue to see a stubborn polarisation of educational achievement based on social backgrounds...and we now see bifurcation of wage and job outcomes as a result of this new technological era, that combination is toxic,"" said Mr Tharman.

> ""It will undermine trust in meritocracy, in the state and in markets. It's a future that we have to avoid.""

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( I would agree with him if skilled vocation were highly paid like in US.

Here, you hardly make a living becoming an electrician, woodworker, plumber etc. Mostly because competition from foreigners who ask for less than $2k.

There are a few specialists who can make more than others (power generators) but still, I was told there are many Indian nationals who were hired with much less salary for the amount of experience/money needed for locals to get there. College fees ain't cheap , compared to vocational educational fees.. Wise words from an international diplomat. We need more fellows like him. Can you hear that, that‚Äôs LYK rolling in his grave.. Do what I say, not what I do.

He just shot his foot with his statement - 

""The best-educated and better-off parents also invest more into their children's education and enrichment compared to median and lower-income  parents, a trend sharply on the rise in the last 20 to 30 years. ""

Kindly define ""best-educated""

His viewpoint & ""proofs"" are so full of holes and half-truths. Why then are FT with degrees in such great demand here over locals with degree? It's not just the paper qualification but the process of getting it - the education & guidance.

The only area he might be correct is with respect to paper generals and their ineptitude to function well outside papa's graces.. Agency exploiting foreign intern students, gets more of Student's pay- Partner Schools aware this operation.Need advice!

So this is my personal experience of interning in Singapore.I enrolled a Certificate course and internship thru agency Empire located in Jurong West. This is a 3 month certificate in Retail and Sales Management that comes with¬† 6 months internship.They get students to come to Singapore. So all the students for these classes come¬† various countries across SEA and Central Asia.

After the 3 month course, we'll be sent for internships for 6 months usually in the F&B and hospitality.I got internship in a restaurant and bar, so working hours for me are Monday to Saturday¬† 8hrs a day or 44hrs a week but since its mostly active at night, I extend or OT until 10pm or very late 3am. 

For this work, i only get 650 a month including allowances. I discovered the contract between the employer and the agency partner of the school, it states that the agency will get 750/month during the 6months as they will provide us training in English or other skills necessary. But this isnt true at all, my english is good and they dont offer such.In fact, this is their way of getting commission from our internship pay.They do this to all their interns as they have partnership with 4 schools: TEG, ALS, Trinity and Kingston in Jurong.

Here are my worries: 

The schools wont issue certificate until we finished the 6months internship ( of course they get their cut).But isnt 6month internship too long for a 3month certificate course? Obviously, theyre doing this to exploit interns.Is 650 enough to eat 3x a day and live in a student dorm? OT rate is 4/hr.I came here to get experience, with just enough money to pay tuition fee, dorm and basic needs for few months. But these are clear exploitations. We work hard while these schools and agency gets the most from intern allowance/pay.need your advice. And hes still not wrong.. It‚Äôs only ‚Äúsomething less‚Äú because our society deems it so.
Tradesmen in other advanced economies can make a decent living.
We only have our own prejudices to blame.. Which is an absolutely reasonable statement to make. Your qualifications are only as valuable as the existing supply and demand allow it to be. If there is an oversupply, you‚Äôre essentially sitting on a worthless degree. If your degree is from one of the less prestigious institutions, you‚Äôll be the first to be eliminated from the pool of candidates. 

It‚Äôs a hard truth. I think the tone is, you know who you are, you‚Äôll be better off as a tradesperson, stop kidding yourself and get to it.. Don't understand why university education = elite in this part of the world. Even back in the 1940s and 1950s, the average joe in the West had college degrees. They still had to hustle for jobs. Nobody was under the misconception that having a degree means a golden ticket to a cushy, lifelong employment in a managerial position.. We're ready for a Malay president but not an Indian prime minister it seems.. Lee Yew Kwan?. The trades are currently in a vicious cycle of cost-cutting. No sane Singaporean is gonna take a huge paycut for the added hours and stress in a job market that deems Singaporeans as ""too entitled"" and ""too expensive"" to hire. Trades in the 80's was a decent place to earn money and even aim to retire by 55. Employees were well-trained, well-skilled, and the pay was pretty liveable. Then it took a nosedive in the 90's and 00's with the push for more white collar workers, and the subsequent importation of cheap labour from neighbouring countries. Companies started viewing employees as cheap and expendable, and not worth retaining in the long-term. Singaporeans with their liveable paychecks started looking like huge expenses on the balance sheet, and had to take a paycut in order to retain their jobs. With companies addicted to the steady supply of cheap labour, why would they ever consider a local who is easily 2-3x more expensive to hire?. But we're not like them because our country very small ok, and last time used to be a small fishing village. So what if we're one of the richest in the world per capita now? Last time Japanese took over ok.. Troof.. Something about a history of imperial examinations to choose scholars who become ministers. 

Some things never change.. What Malay President ?. This is the second Indian President after Nathan .....  

Ethnicity is based on the ethnicity of your father, not the mother .... Like I said. We only have ourselves to blame.

Who were the ones who decided that blue collar work was less valuable than office jobs? And in doing so, who enabled cheap foreign labour to come in to fill the dearth of tradesmen in Singapore?

It is us.

We decided that a cushy office job was more respectable, and we voted for the government that enable policies favouring migrant workers.

3. Do I have to further my studies after graduation? (E.g. Major/PhD)
4. (For alumni only) How easy or difficult is it to find a job in Singapore after you graduate, or do you have to live overseas to be employed? Do you like your current job?

168,Australian Documentary's look at the Singapore's Education System (15 Oct 2019),dji1or,2019-10-18 04:04:14,notexthere,6,0.65,15.0,"Did they left out [""authoritarian parenting""]( as well?. I'll just leave this here:

OECD Adult Skills rankings 2013‚Äì2016

**Adult literacy**

Australia: 5th out of 35 / Singapore: 27th out of 35

**Adult numeracy**

Australia: 15th out of 35 / Singapore: 25th out of 35

**Adult problem-solving**

Australia: 7th out of 35 / Singapore: 9th out of 35

Additionally, Australia outperformed Singapore in all domains across all categories of education (lower than upper secondary, upper secondary, and tertiary).





All that time spent with after-school and weekend tuition, and for what?. Singapore's education system is a huge failure. They churn out indoctrinated lemmings who support the establishment, and have unwavering loyalty to the status quo. Many of whom are on this sub.. can't watch it in Australia ):. More like helicopter parenting. That‚Äôs a really manipulative way to present data.

Look at the metric distribution by age group and you‚Äôll realise that younger Singaporeans perform better than their elders. Unlike Australia and the OECD average which has actually seen a decline.. I would like to think it as what is it in for me to do the test as an adult? If there is nothing to gain, I would just do it hastily to get out of the test. Surely Israel can't be worse than Singapore?. shots fired. Who hurt you?. Oh shit, same

Edit:  You can watch it here. I disagree. Heavy emphasis on exam performance and private tuition were prevalent in Singapore by the 1990's, whilst in Australia private tuition remains uncommon even today. Despite this, Singaporeans who went through that system were still outperformed by their Australian contemporaries in literacy for all age groups except for the youngest group (still in school or recent graduates). In numeracy and problem-solving the Singaporeans were overtaken by Australians from age 35 onwards, despite the 35-44-year-old Singaporeans having schooled during the era of private tuition and exam-centric education.

My contention is that Singapore‚Äôs intense extra-curricular activity during the schooling years has not translated into useful long-term outcomes for Singaporeans, and anathema towards life-long educational pursuits that is generated by the local school system has resulted in the drop-off in adult skills that is seen 10-15 years after exiting the school system.

If the drop-offs seen in the three curves are all shifted to the right for the Singaporean cohorts over the next 10 years then I‚Äôll stand corrected and eat my words.. PSLE. > They churn out indoctrinated lemmings

What sort of Manager and company can't handle cover for in-camp. Wedding and honeymoon is a once in a lifetime affair. Surely the in-camp was not last minute with. It does not matter if she wanted to volunteer but this is ridiculous. 

Looks like SMRT still has cultural issues. 

This reminds me the case of a SATS staff who paid out o this pocket to fly to India to return a passenger's property.. Woman has to cancel honeymoon because company doesn't know how to delegate tasks properly.

Government: ""Why no babies?"". She should've just gone for her honeymoon. No company gives a fuck about individual sacrifice in the long run so why should you?. Honestly, this is fucking stupid. Could the company not apply for him to defer if they really needed him there? This is also SMRT, they probably could get the deferment easily.

No reason for her to cancel her honeymoon, did the company even reimburse her?. Love for nation > Love for husband.. Such an obvious marketing ploy.

I feel bad for the husband tho.... Anecdotal story:

At the end of ICT there was this guy who won some NSMAN of the year award. Rationale for winning?

His wife had given birth recently and is currently sick, but he still dutifully did and completed his ICT.. r/aboringdystopia. Should have just went for her honeymoon, we are all expendables.. Thought it was satirical, turns out it's true to life. Ok then.. This is why you work for shit pay and shit conditions while having to go back for ict. They would have known of his ICT and her own leave arrangements way in advance. Asking her to cancel it at the last moment is just poor planning if you ask me.. I covered my co-worker when he left for reservist. 

Worked a ton of OT too. He did the same for me. We sacrificed time with family and couldn‚Äôt take leave as well. 

Why nobody give us award?. I‚Äôm disgusted. SMRT shouldn‚Äôt have made their problem her problem!. This only serves to highlight shitty management. Uh it‚Äôs so drastic.. Prestige. It is used to make people do free or stupid things.. Spoil market, other employers may try to 'encourage' this behaviour

Then again, its SMRT. Poor planning. Recall order usually send out way ahead. Wow....I think the company should have been ashamed of themselves. If you only have two people who are able to do the job, then I think you need to re-evaluate your company's training policy and procedure. I work in a company of 11 people and at least 3-4 people would know how to perform each function except for accounting which we can outsource if necessary.  I would not have been happy if my husband cancelled our honeymoon only to fill in for someone else's job..... I sacrificed my bonding time with family to cover my colleagues when they either went for ict or on maternity leave.

Yet I received nothing.. If there were only two people in that job doesn‚Äôt that mean that she had no choice in the matter anyways?. ""The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care.""

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( ya, article title made it sounds like some small SME... but this is SMRT we are talking about, how is it that a person have to cancel her wedding & honeymoon for something like this? 

and we are supposed to applaud SMRT for understaff?. Agree. There's nothing to celebrate with news like this.

It's part organisational failure and part employee exploitation.

I feel bad for the couple given how [honeymoons seem to be associated with lower risk of subsequent divorce]( >Looks like SMRT still has cultural issues.

Well they are definitely deep seated issues. ""There are only the two of us in this job"" so yeah, understaffed is an understatement.. Just lie back and think of England?. Wait, what are they marketing. This sends a terrible message.... I‚Äôve got a platoon mate who got a similar award for attending ICT which started the day after his wedding. Dude didn‚Äôt even take time off on the first day which is usually the most relaxed day of ICT. All of us were like *wtf man*. That's kinda fucked up. My OC would have easily let this guy go but I know most are too patriotic and nationalistic that they view anything else as treachery. r/nottheonion   


fits there too.. Huh doesnt your employer get to make a claim for your salary from MINDEF? Unless your income heavily commission based or something. Ok you win 5 cookhouse meal coupons. And then there‚Äôs the 6 months‚Äô forecast for high key ICTs

And nobody had the foresight to do something about it so there is coverage, and the lady doesn‚Äôt have to cancel her honeymoon.

Sounds like a fail on all fronts for SMRT. He probably meant PR tactic. Company saw it as a way to gain good publicity, nominated her for the award. Not saying she doesn't deserve it, but SMRT shouldn't have had that issue at all.. Maybe he really regretted the wedding?. To be fair, I have no idea whether is it:

1. This guy being a terrible husband/father in general and using ICT as an excuse
2. He's really not allowed to defer/ leave camp
3. Combination of the above.

Even if reason 1 above is the sole reason and it's not SAF's fault, I didn't like them trying to portray this as something to be commended.. Don't so drama la. What treachery. Most reservist units are also staffed by NS men. They also understand that people have commitments.. So why‚Äôs she putting in extra work?. yup, for my reservist, even the low key one, i already known about the next date as soon as my current ict was coming to an end. 

This year more tight with 2 ict but even then, there's still more than 6 months in between.. Nah he was just SUPER SIAO ON about the whole army thing - dude should've just signed on if he liked playing soldier that much.. You should talk to my previous OC. Literally his words - 

*You can't pass IPPT? How can you even protect your family? Shameful*

*I know you all don't want to come to IPT. I'm sorry but unless you change your citizenship and become a traitor, come or I'll sent out my provost*

171,Singapore‚Äôs Lee Hsien Loong a social media hero in China for Hong Kong protest comments,djhkej,2019-10-18 03:23:07,notexthere,38,0.75,108.0,"""Hell yeah I also hate protests""

-LHL. I don't think he was that biased towards either side tbh in his comments.  His stance was as neutral as could be.. Many western political analyst and international relations experts are already holding the view that the situation has gone to a point where the demands are unrealistic and unattainable. 

It was raised recently on CSIS (Center for Strategic and International Studies) that the a huge concern now is that there is no clear leader among the protestors. There is no one to negoatiate with, no one to speak directly and personally.

While liberals will support the movement, everyone cannot deny what LHL said. The Mainland Chinese must acknowledge the two systems but Hong Kongers must also acknowledge that it is one country.. While I'm not personally a fan of his comments, the leader of this country must be pragmatic if nothing else. 

I wonder how long this goodwill from them will last though, the mob is often fickle when it comes to these kinds of things.. now he gotta watch his words carefully, could piss off both hk and china. getting fucked from all angles. He understands the concept of, ""distant relative not as good as near neighbour"". Doesnt matter what you say; people are always going to twist your words to suit their own agenda (ie the differences between the hk protestors' reaction and this).

Moral of the story: Haters gonna hate, fans gonna praise. Learn to be immune to both criticism and adulation from others, and in the words of a very wise bard, to thine own self be true.. The protest has come to, 

You don't fight, you'll be in jail a few years later (The Crackdown)

You fight, you'll also be put to jail but at least there's a very very small chance something gonna change. So yeah lose-lose for all.

So I kinda doubt Singapore protest would be exactly like HK, HK rn is Police Vs Protesters

For us is what? We are the Police, the Army, the Firefighters.. Shh, You'll trigger the pro HK narutards who will jump in with their 'fuck china and fuck you if you disagree' rhetoric, stab you in the neck when you are not looking, then cry foul when you pull out a gun to defend yourself after being ganged down by a group of dozen strong rioters wielding hammers and rods.. rmb to register with MFA when going Hongkong from now on :P. trying to see if LHL looks like Piglet.. In US, u have Lebrons. Sg, lhl.. True he's a moderate. But the world (read: western) and HK media will skew it to appear as if he is not. 

I won't be surprised to see labels of dictator, totalitarian state, chinazi sympathizer etc used on him by the ultra pro-HK camp.

It's gonna be ugly.

Edit: some of it are already showing in r/hongkong 's equivalent post on the topic. Mods probably wouldn't want me to link it , so I won't  .. He said that the 5 demands only serve to humiliate the government. That is definitely not neutral.. The last group of student leaders that met with the government in 2014, 4 of 5 was subsequently thrown in jail on protest related charges. U volunteer?

Also, no government concessions from back then. At least 1 now. Now the Catalonian Independence Movement has picked up steam and is aiming to emulate HK. Let's see how it turns out.. agreed, this is some dangerous times and need to tread water carefully, ideally, not tread at all. >the mob is often fickle when it comes to these kinds of things.

Yup they are even if it's their objectives don't match other than hating China. As you have pointed out, courting China's good will seems to be an exercise in futility, since they can easily just change their minds at any point. The whole point being made here is that a civil and modern society needs order and stability to function.

The mob isnt that, and is infact a threat to any modern society, and don't deserve recognition. 

Observers should flip through the history books and see what happens when minorities and disenfrenchised try to riot or upset western governments in western history.. Check out the response to any vaguely China related funny gif on /r/all man. Literally half the comments can be on ‚Äúfuck china‚Äù.. hey, this guy is using the pragmatic talking point again. I just don't think any civil chinese society would riot the way the HKers did. That they do, is a sign of interference, instigation and provocation.

At the end HK is just a small state in a region of much larger players, and are being used as a poison pawn by the west for geopolitical purposes.  Can't actually have china project themselves through their 1BR south sea route and north rail route.

 It is the wests attempt to cling on to their declining influence in the region. By using whatever they have to deny China's expansion to the west.. Correct me if im wrong, but aint ppl in us started to hate lebron for what he says?. They are now discussing burning Singapore consulate, DBS Bank, and other Singaporean businesses.. Well some of the demands will never ever be agreeable especially by CCP. More importantly, some protestors have come out to say that even if the 5 demands are met, they will go on protesting sooooo. Read the whole article, he also said 

>However, Mr Lee believed that universal suffrage can be made to work in Hong Kong even though it is not a country. 

>‚ÄúIf it's not made to work, then I think it's very difficult to imagine that ‚ÄòOne Country, Two Systems‚Äô can continue for another 28 years until 2047,‚Äù he added, referring to the year the principle expires.

I think he was pretty clear that changes need to be made by the government and in attitude from the mainland as well.

>‚ÄúAs one Hongkonger put it very neatly, from China's point of view, they must not only think of one country, but remember that this is two systems. And from Hong Kong's point of view, they must not only think of two systems, but remember that this is one country‚Äô.‚Äù

It's as neutral as can possibly be, he's a state leader and as far as the language he can use without inflaming tensions, that's about as far as he can go. One of the five demands is to release all arrested protesters without charges, regardless of whether they were arrested because of rioting, vandalism or attacking the police. 

What kind of government would accept such a demand?. I think this is objective. Seems like he is saying the protesters have a reason to be unhappy but they are pursuing the wrong strategy with those demands. Not neutral probably, but reasonable... he too criticise the incompetency of the SAR (hk officials) rather severely. and by extension china share the blame. 

i dont think yourself or protesters could swallow anything as neutral at this point.... They were also released pretty quickly and have received nice benefits from the USA. 

You can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too. Especially when they are so sensitive and get triggered by every damn thing.. it is not like the CIA or Washington DC is not that fickle?.

It's a pity but once upon a time Reddit was better than this. Intellectual discourse prevailed not ideological bandwagoning. Reddit has become more like 4chan than it was a place for constructive, sense based discussion.


 I really do wonder if we have lost net neutrality. Cambridge Analytica and the fact that you can game opinions through algorithms and shift popular opinions away from the truth into ideology means that net neutrality has failed. Our political opinions are now the property of big data.. coz they will get precious silvers and golds if they shout ‚Äú fuck china‚Äù. Dont forget about damn karma!!. Since in your post history, you straight up deny the existence of organ harvesting in China, and praise the ccp model of rule, I'll take your opinion with a pinch of salt.. Qing JamesÔºü. Yap. But in Sg, most ppl won't disagree with lhl.. oh well we need some new renovations anyway /s. Daft hongkies really enjoy saboing themselves.

They have nothing to gain by alienating more people toward their cause.

Really childish. Not surprising because most of them are teenagers. 

They really need a mature and level headed leader to lead their movement unlike the current situation that reminded me of the little india riot.. Source?. Want to revise this comment since nothing happened?. Exactly. It is such a stupid demand especially since they are onboard the 5 or nothing movement.. Yeah, this is the main one that I find ridiculous. Unless the protesters can confidently state that not a *single* arrested person actually broke the law, this demand is basically asking for the rule of law to be lifted.

Like you said, that just isn't going to happen. And since the whole ""5 demands, not one less"" thing has become a slogan and rallying cry for the protesters, they are basically guaranteed to never get what they want.. Well, they could accept the rest, right, and then tell the protesters that that's all that they can give.

But they've only acceded to one demand.. The another thing is that, what‚Äôs next if the gov did accept the demand? Who‚Äôs gonna be in charge next?. [deleted]. Everything is being misconstrued and forced into this black and white pro HK or pro china narrative. 

Reddit itself is spasming out with anti-China rhetoric now. There is no longer a moderate position on anything. Freedom of speech has become freedom to hate.. I'm not saying that PM Lee did anything wrong per se since offending China is not what Singapore needs now. But to painting it as a neutral stance is what gets me.. Actions & consequences. 

Well, it seems the you can give away a fishing village of 7 thousand strong in the 1800s. Then demand it back about 150 years later, 7 million population & a global financial center. 

So I can give away a Sarah Lee cake to you. My adopted son who overthrew me can demand the cake back. Even after the icings & decorations spent on the cake valued it a thousand fold over.. i recognise that some of them have the right to be angry & is currently angry

i wouldnt use the words ""sensitive"" and ""triggered"" to describe them, it is rather uncharitable as they have negative connotation

its like when you talk to someone who is clearly angry, you should kinda expect them to shout at you

these are emotions, right or wrong has no play here

try not to judge them at their worst. For me the key difference is really their stances on human rights. I'd rather butter up to a country that has enshrined human freedoms and rights in their constitution, than to a country that's basically worse than North Korea right now. 

You know China's a full-blown dystopia when people lose access to public transport, the internet and healthcare for simply saying something Supreme Ultimate God Xi Jinping didn't like.. Wow. Not a great 'whataboutism' at all.

As far as I'm aware, the US has never banned a cartoon character, or thrown a tantrum and 'punished' private cormpanies for showing a map of the US that didn't include Hawaii on it.. Has there been proof of organ harvesting though? Almost every article cites short queues on organ wait lists and medical checkups as unmistakable evidence of organ harvest. Take note, the numbers they claim are staggering, on the order of 100,000s. To kill 100,000 silently is already difficult, but to harvest their organs in a manner that keeps the organs viable? 

If u go polyclinic and they expedite your wait, doesnt mean they kill the patients in front of u?. There you go twisting my words (I didn't say organ harvesting did not exist, I claim that it did, but not in the numbers published ), labelling me by calling me pro-china, and then summarily dismissing me because of said label, and then immediately jumping on to this anti-china bandwagon with thoughts and emotions fully formed for you.

Please, practice your critical thinking and think for yourself.. See another recent post here. Because? They did discuss. Whether they act on it is yet to say.. maybe bargain for 5 and get 3 out of 5, every additional demand satisfied reduces the rallying power of the movement.. Wait what. The release of all protesters is totally one of the [five demands]( 

Are you telling me that as one of the HK protesters you don't even know what the demands are? Jesus Christ.

Congratulations, you have just lost whatever little credibility you have in my eyes.. Yea i agree. Things are getting too extreme, that‚Äôs when things get dangerous... Eh please la the UK didn't have the resources to deal with colonies after the second world war. They decided to give up hong kong after the lease of the new territories was up.

Also how Britain decided to only give BNIO passports to the hong kongers who qualify clearly showed they wanted to give up Hong Kong and sort of boh chup it once it hit 1997. Hong Kong was ‚Äúgiven away‚Äù by China under duress after it was invaded by the UK. And as much as China demanded to have Hong Kong back, the UK and China agreed without much conflict that Hong Kong will be returned to the PRC.

Maybe Hongkongers should be more angry at the UK because they deemed that after the expiry of the New Territories lease, it was impossible for them to maintain and defend Hong Kong. So the UK decided to give it up instead.

This is a case where your son steals your cake by pointing a knife at you because you refuse to give him money and after the cake is valued more, your son realise he‚Äôs allergic to the cake now so he hands it back to you so he can go back and eat his fish and chips.. >So I can give away a Sarah Lee cake to you. My adopted son who overthrew me can demand the cake back. Even after the icings & decorations spent on the cake valued it a thousand fold over.

you don't know about the opium war, right? your example doesn't makes much sense because going your cake logic, you didn't gave away the Sara Lee cake, someone sucker punched you and forced you to give away your cake else he cut off your dick. Although you did gave the cake, you just so happened to write a contractual lease of the cake with the guys such that he will return you the cake 99 years later (as such you didn't 'gave' away the cake, but merely 'lease' it.

Probably need to read up more on history because just commenting based on feelings is gonna makes you look like an idiot. I know china is the big bad right now but.......a contract is a contract. You can't say, because 'china = bad' so contract doesn't count now. Man, the slope couldn't be more slippery.

[\_for\_the\_Extension\_of\_Hong\_Kong\_Territory]( It's really revealing the maturity and knowledge levels the pro HK camp have. 

They are all either naive who know nothing about HK and China, or just ideological fundamentalists who only see everything two dimensionally. 

They shout their ideas rather than have an ability to argue for them, or consider a different view. You are a friend if you agree with them, otherwise they will label you , dismiss you, and then practice their freedom to hate on you.. Agreed. 

From a pro-protesters perspectives tension are high as many of them feel like their basic liberties are being systematically taken from them and are seeing people who are part of their cause being brutalized by a ruthless government.

From a pro-CCP perspective tensions are also equally high as they feel that the unity that is keeping their nation together is being torn apart by rowdy traitors. 

Asking either side to calm down and be charitable to the other side is going to be hard.. I have worked in lived in China for 2 years. I went that very apprehensive, thinking people are gonna steal my shit and the governments out to get me. You know what? After 2 years I realized its is pretty much all western propaganda. Taxi uncles were bitching about government, complaining about polices. Nobody was living is fear that you keep hearing.. Please read the below and see how the west stance is not hypocritical at all.

[]( Tell that to the descendents of the slaves they lynched or the America indians they massacred,  from the cotton fields in pre war Alabama , through  to the Jim Crow era segregationists, MLK,  to the black lives matter protestors today .

Ask a typical black american today if he feels that he is equal or free in America. 

The US imprisons 7 to 1 more prisoners in their for profit prison systems , per capita, than China, who are also majority non-white minorities. Abu Gharib, Guantanamo bay exists, and they have been fighting a war against the Islamists for 3 decades now . How many bombs, bullets and blood have they spilled there ?  How many middle easterns have been displaced ?

In which Rick and Morty universe do you live in that ""china is basically worst than north korea now"" ? Ffs buy a plane ticket to Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou or Shanghai please. 

History and statistics cut through the ideology you've been fed and brought up on. The history of China and the CCP is far tamer than the history of the US and the west (from slavery to colonization to war). 

""Those who can convince you of absurdities, can commit you to atrocities. "" - Voltaire. you the irony is that USA did not ratify many core human rights treaties. Just go to Human Rights Watch to see that. The propaganda machine that had been screaming ""but your human rights record!"" at China has since turned into ""unfair trade practises"". Time to update your rhetoric.. The American solution to Muslim terrorism is to kill more Muslims. 

Anyone who doesn‚Äôt find that horrifying does not respect human rights in my book.. Well, the US did recently try to persecute 2 activist protester. They could face decades in jail time. I don't see how their actions are different from the Hong Kong protesters.

Yes, US have not done what you mentioned. But they sure have a shoddy record, and many of these things are not publicized to the world.

You must have also not known about this.

[]( >Not a great whataboutism.

>Posts a worse whataboutism. you can buy Winnie the Pooh toys and ride the Winnie ride in Shanghai disneyland.... the so called search being banned has more to do with how they perceive trolling. We call it satire, they feel it is insulting(?). Thailand also enforces their ""dun insult the royalty"" law rather zealously... I seriously dun think it is a problem. It isn't Disney that purposely trolled president Xi.. It just so happens the world is slowly becoming more anti-china now. And it's not hard to see why.

I'm hardly ""jumping on an anti-china bandwagon"" . I've been that way for a long time. You really think anybody needs to be swayed or mislead by a crowd in order to be anti-china?

In the same way you seem to devote your entire post history to talking crap about the hk protests? Why? Who are you even trying to convince? This sub is an echo chamber of mostly ethnic Chinese. The rest of reddit despises China (and for good reason). Notwithstanding their atrocities, they have the absolute worst pr in the world (proven by their recent actions against private companies). Your pro-China ramblings are futile to most people and only make you look like you're desperately trying to defend the indefensible.. I like your analogy.. ‚ÄúIn 1819, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles negotiated a treaty whereby Johor allowed the British to locate a trading port on the island, leading to the establishment of the British colony of Singapore in 1819.‚Äù ‚Äî Wikipedia [History of Singapore](

All treaties & contracts are signed between parties with power imbalances. I sign housing loan only because bank have more money than me & can legally lend me.

As a Singaporean who gets to choose my government, I hope the same upon other people. Is this evil or seditious?. I believe they are still the minority. Most young Singaporeans are able to see from different perspectives and understand the nuances in world politics and history. They understand that the world they inherited is far more complex than the previous generation. They know that China is not all evil. America is not all evil. We must be friends with everyone. Democracy can suffer from the tyranny of the mob, Single party rule can lead to totalitarian. Most are not naive.. Exactly the same. I went there being anti communist. I came back understanding that China is actually a meritocratic technocratic plutocracy. It stopped being communist after Mao. It is only communist in name only, something that is drummed up to the max by the western rhetoric.. true. actually dont go public. everthing is fine. i can say 99.99% western people dont know china.  because of the media.. You mean the only rational solution to terrorism is to kill the terrorists. It's not like America is actively hunting down people for being Muslim. You sound like you've been drinking way too much of that CNN Kool-Aid.. That's what I'm referring to, I didn't realise I'd need to be so specific for you. You obviously can buy merchandise. The 'ban' is on featuring it alongside Xi either making fun of him, or as a means of referring to him.

Let me know when the US govt. does something similar for trump.. I mean this is just rhetoric and ad honinem attacks really. 

Reddit used to be a better more intellectual place where people argued using reason, facts, statistics and referenced philosophers, writers books etc. 

Nowadays, If you say fuck the US. Then your a terrorist.

Fuck Israel . You are anti-semite.

Fuck Africa. Then you are a racist.

But say Fuck china. You get 40k upvotes and get called a hero. 

Even though the fact is that a strong and stable china has drastically lowered manufacturing costs for the world and enabled everyone to afford better things. That China has uplifted a billion and more people from a gdp per capita worst than Africa to the second largest economy today, securing and stabilizing the region , bringing infrastructure and development to the poorest nations.

But all this is indefensible, meaningless according to you, and china remains demonized as this big communist boogieman who commits 'atrocities' and must be hated even though the west has practiced slavery, apartheid , colonization, committed the Holocaust , literally produced Hitler, two world wars, trail of tears, genocide and massacres all around the world. 

Do a tally of the atrocities and life lost or displaced under the west with what china has done, and the numbers will reveal the truth. China's reeducation camps and civil war deaths pale in comparison.

The truth is that you hate china simply because they represent something different from what you are used to. Singapore and Japan was dismissed that way too during their developing years, yet look at them today.

Singapore like china is also a one party legalist authoritarian meritocratic technocratic plutocracy. Singapore even executes more per capita than China. But all your concerned with is the communist label, and you judge everything through that lens.

It is petty.. It actually happened didn‚Äôt it? The Brits gave us independence and it was decided (between us, the Federation and the Brits) that we will join the Federation. Malaysia then expelled us out of the Federation years after. We declared independence (together with the water agreements), which was accepted by Malaysia, so Malaysia will not be able to claim sovereignty over us. 

For Hong Kong, the Brits gave its sovereignty back to China in 1997. Literally the whole world sees that China has sovereignty over Hong Kong.. >All treaties & contracts are signed between parties with power imbalances. I sign housing loan only because bank have more money than me & can legally lend me.

Again, wrong example. You signed housing loan because you chose to. You are not beaten to submission to sign the loan, did you?

Also, by the mid-20th century, The west was on the verge of de-colonization due to global protest. Almost every remote colonies were ceded back to their original state. Stop treating like Hong Kong is a unique situation and demand that only 'china = bad' is doing.

Also, the people were 'given away as livestock'? Did you complain about it too when Singapore was annexed into UK's Crown Colony, became Syonan-to, became a state of the Malaysia Federation and then subsequently not again? Why is Hong Kong ceded due UK and then given back to China a 'different' case from all the other colonization and de-colonization effort in the world? Because, erm....China = bad and thus everything china demands now = bad by definition of virtue?

Better stop looking at the world with such rose tinted glass of black and white.

People likes you makes me sick man, with double standard. No more different than the Brexit deniers.

""I believe in Democracy! The people's choice must be respected!""

Brexit referendum happened, results not what they wanted and they can't blame something like the electoral college.

""The referendum results doesn't count! We need another referendum!""

It's like global rules and contracts can be and must be change based on your 'feelings'.

I'm sorry to break it to you but global laws and structure ain't operated based on 'feelings' & 'emotions'.

You can't say rules apply to only the 'good' but doesn't apply to the 'bad'.. if that is the case, then why retreat from Afghanistan? Why discard the Kurds after they have bore the brunt of IS \*for\* the USA? I am not a big fan of CNN's reporting either but you are pivoting really hard by simplifying what the US administration has done internationally for decades to being delivering Justice n Freedom. Hint: Exporting Freedom was simply to get more oil. Now that USA exports oil... they are not interested in exporting freedom.. Lmao this is fun. 

You will be surprised that Malaysia and Indonesia has been rehabilitating Muslim terrorists for years now and SEA is not the fucking Middle East in spite of it.

 The only rational solution to terrorism is fucking education and economics, not killing them.

Why do you people keep demonising these people? They are humans too. We have to solve the core issues than trying to spread hate and fear.. you do know that with a VPN the search ban is not even going to do a thing. Complain abt the ""great firewall"" all you want. The problem I see with absolute free speech is that if one side absolutely believes that they are right and just, there is no longer discussion. Free speech is also about tolerance. Not ""shut up, I am democratic and you are not, you do not even deserve to have a conversation with me"".

In my opinion, President Donald Trump's open aggression on the ""free press"" when they do not report him favorably is an affront to the ideals. Look at LeBron's outburst on twitter when mostly what he was asking for is just fair treatment. Players get fined for saying stuff like that but a GM is protected? When the message is ""free HK"", LeBron is pillared on twitter. Yet ppl were ""censored"" when it was ""black lives matters""?

The message abt freedoms, democracy and other human rights from USA, the west in general always coincide with their other interest. Look at the clamp down and worry that Catalonia independence is back on the agenda. Ukraine had their successful color revolution (the one HK is modeling their weekend parties on), have anyone even bothered to ask why now Ukraine went from industrial powerhouse to the womb of the world? Is surrogate pregnancy not exploitative?

The CCP has to get more on board with a lot of things but they should be allowed the space n time to do it on their own terms. It is ""neo-colonial"" for the West to declare that it has to be like them immediately or ""sanctions, censure and world wide media zoomed in coverage"". That‚Äôs very fortunate for Singapore to go independent without too much instability. In most of places around the world, unfortunately that‚Äôs not always the case.

People may not even ask for independent. Simply trying to get corrupted officers accountable may often result in bloodshed in many places. 

In recent history, our grandparents had to fight so hard from Japanese governance. They didn‚Äôt accept it, and a lot of them paid with their live. Freedom very often isn‚Äôt free.. If I was around to complain about turning into the Light of the South, I‚Äô probably not have the computer savvy to bitch here.

Johor Sultanate give away Singapore can take back because they were bullied?

Can Singapore ask for Christmas Island back from Australia? Reason poverty back then, better now. Fairness!

Russia pays back USA for Alaska same. Poor then, got oil now!

Glad I make you sick. Hope your family gets sick too!. So... your point is that China, with its Muslim *concentration camps*, social credit system, thought policing, and absolute lack of democracy has a better human rights record?

US meddling in other countries has not always generated good results for the countries, but they're nowhere as bad as Xi Jinping's China. At the very least, if the US gets a bad president who goes around fucking things up he'll get kicked out come next election. Xi Jinping has already made himself Emperor For Life so you know the dystopian bullshit isn't going anywhere.

Your fucking feelings has no bearings on the legality of china's sovereign over hong kong.. Don't forget, US did not find weapon of mass destruction in Iraq.  The [I]( body count project documents 183,348 - 205,908 violent civilian deaths through April 2019 resulting from the US led 2003 Iraq war.

Is this a better human rights record? Using freedom and protection as a rationale is okay to go declare war on a country and produce so many civilian death count a good human rights record?

200k civilian deaths vs incarcerating millions of their own citizens because they're Muslim. 

Kay sure, I'm the one who's smoking something.. **Iraq Body Count project**

Iraq Body Count project (IBC) is a web-based effort to record civilian deaths resulting from the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Included are deaths attributable to coalition and insurgent military action, sectarian violence and criminal violence, which refers to excess civilian deaths caused by criminal action resulting from the breakdown in law and order which followed the coalition invasion. As of February 2019, the IBC has recorded 183,249 ‚Äì 205,785 civilian deaths. The IBC has a media-centered approach to counting and documenting the deaths.

I'd rather not side with either of them, and try to stay objectively neutral, which is what LHL has done.. You are dumpster diving here and defending civilian death as a better track record.

Plus, not including this. 

[]( Their constitution does guarantee those freedoms *for their citizens*, and if Americans decided they didn't want states restricting protests, they can do it via the voting booth. Chinese citizens can't. So as far as how the country treats its own citizens, US already beats China hands down.

Let's not forget that the US also actually has *elections*, so politicians are still beholden to the Americans who, as a whole, still take pride in their country's ""freedom"" branding. They won't dare to pull the kind of bullshit that Xi Jinping can and will if given the chance to.

Would you rather side with a country that has a lot to lose if they ever went full-Hitler, or a country that's already basically almost-Hitler, and not shy about threatening to go full-Hitler if they don't get their way?. So are you saying that the incarceration, rape and torture of millions of citizens during peacetime is better than 200k civilian deaths in a war?

Your argument is basically ""any bad is bad, all bad are equally bad"". Which is absolutely nonsensical, because that would mean you have to believe that jaywalking is on par with murder just because both are crimes.. I think I made myself clear. "" I'd rather not side with either of them, and try to stay objectively neutral"".

I don't know if you are choosing to ignore everything and hold your own truth. Obeying Human rights goes beyond simply your own border and your own citizen. So anyone not a US citizen are considered less human and are entitled to lesser human rights in US eyes?

Also, accusing China going full-Hilter is trivializing the horrors that Hilter has committed.

You are an awful human being.  

I will rest my case, and I see a point in continuing.. I like how you just skim through the other examples that doesn‚Äôt seem in your favor. But ok, good for you and your opinion. :). Given the small size of our country, if we are unable to stay neutral and are forced to choose between one or the other, USA would be a better choice.

LHL isn't staying neutral with his comments.

And if you think China's atrocities aren't almost Hitler level, you're an awful human being. Concentration camps that torture, rape and murder people of a certain subgroup? Check. Brutal thought policing? Check. Police state? Check. Murdering their own citizens by rolling over them with tanks? Check. The only thing they haven't done is start a world war. Which is why I said they're almost-Hitler.

There's nothing trivial about what China's been doing. Just because mass media has elevated Hitler into some kind of unbeatable King-Of-All-Evils doesn't mean no one can actually match up to what he did.. Ok",6306.0,15,1,1
172,Need some advice on audit dilemma,djhgul,2019-10-18 03:14:45,"I‚Äôm the poor soul that is designated to liaise with external auditors in my department that is doing sales. (I‚Äôm in an MNC)

While preparing and retrieving certain cases that are closed, I realised that the sales people are skipping a lot of the ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù steps that are put in place after past years audits.

I have managed some cases myself, and I can tell that there‚Äôs no shady shit involved, they are probably just skipping steps for the sake of being fast. These people are experienced, hence they know what they are doing.

Now the problem is... I‚Äôm supposed to clean up their cases (magically produce all the missing documents/steps, backdate them) before I pass them to the external auditor. I know this is a norm in many companies but it just feels wrong.. Should I not do them so that I won‚Äôt make myself liable for anything? &lt; and risk losing my job cause I‚Äôm still on probation :/

tldr - on probation, tasked to clean up closed cases by my sales team before sending the cases to external auditors.

Edit for more clarity:

Simplified sales process-
Step 1: fact find, 
Step 2: Prepare a quote and justify why you are quoting that rate,
Step 3: client agree to the terms,
Step 4: close the case.

Now when I‚Äôm doing the audit checks, I found out that some cases are missing step 2/3. 

Superior is asking me to plug in the gaps myself but I‚Äôve decided that I will compile a list of missing documents, approach the relevant salespeople and get them to justify the missing documents themselves.

Thanks for all the advice given! They helped me gain some clarity on what to do.",19,0.85,33.0,"If you're not exactly hard up on getting this job, just straight up tell the auditors that this & that was not in place and never did. Highlight all the deficiencies to the auditors and let them handle the management with an qualified audit opinion or audit points. If it goes well this might prompt your CFO to clean up internally. If not then at least you can live up to your conscience.

Am auditor. I highly  recommend that you don't magically produce documents and back-date them. Just two years ago, I was involved with internal audit to fire 2 employees who did that. We also made police report because its falsification of documents.. You can whistle blow. Most mncs have a confidential hotline. But that may be a detriment to you.

Or you can go through the backdating.. I would just tell the auditors what is missing, no point forging documents. It is not your job to cover up the mistakes of your colleagues; it is your job to expose them.. Do not backdate anything. MNC - DO NOT DO THAT. There could be multiple issues (depending on the HQ country) and you may be violating without your knowledge. YES, you are legally liable for FALSIFYING documents, or TAMPERING. The dependencies are enormous and not easy to simply say 'it's ok or you are in trouble because of this specific reason'. To give a simple example, let's assume the end customer is a public sector or Gov firm and by falsifying the docs, you may be violating 404 of SOX. Raise a case with internal Audit Committee or whistleblower and if not, leave the place

Exp: I am an ISO lead auditor (but not practising) and handled internal + external audits for a couple of years.. Shouldn't you ask the sales to do this clean up and let you review?

If not shady stuff it's at max just minor finding.. escalate to your boss instead of reddit. Feel wrong or run the risk of feeling hungry, it's up to you honestly.

All I can say is being moral is not the main method people use to put food on the table, though I guess it can give some a peaceful rest at night.

If your situation is such that you can survive without a job for an extended period of time, then just tell your boss it's wrong and you are not going to do it, tio fired then so be it lo. Depends on the nature of regulator.

If it's financial/accounting OR money laundering related - this will be frowned upon.

If it's sales / protection of clients - evidencing they were explained the risks properly etc. This is less stringent and akin to you signing your T&C when upgrading an app (put very crudely, but a quick example)

All the best, But in fairness perhaps prepare an own audit trail of what you did to ""tidy up"", and keep that list with yourself for housekeeping. This may come in handy if at all needed to identify true gaps.

PS: the purpose of audit isn't to find criminals, so think of them as your benefactors. I know this isn't the general view, but it will help.. Do what is right. Hope you're not one of my clients lol. 

You've already received some opinions suggesting you should try going to the auditors. Let me try playing devil‚Äôs advocate. It‚Äôs highly likely that the auditor is swarmed with work and control deficiencies like this are just going to increase their workload, usually by increase the number of samples that they want to test and documenting the deficiencies. 

Assuming you‚Äôre almost completely sure there‚Äôs no shady business going on, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too hard about just going along with your instructions. The auditors for their part have already factored in the likelihood that this might be going on behind the scenes, it just forms part of their detection risk. It‚Äôs part of their responsibility to design their tests and procedures to minimise the risk of this not being picked up. 

If you absolutely must do something about the issue, just quietly drop a tip to one of the auditors and let them decide what they want to do about it once you‚Äôre ready to leave the company. If possible, keep some emails or other evidence as insurance in case you‚Äôre worried they might try to stick everything on you in the end.. Thanks for your advice!

Hmm legally am I liable for anything if I do clean up the cases for them?

Oh and my director wants to check through the cases to make sure I cleaned them up properly before sending them to the auditor. So if I go straight to the auditor, am definitely going to be fired.. Thank you for your advice. I‚Äôve decided not to magically produce any documents. 

I will prepare a list of missing documentations and submit it to the sales team. They can either justify why it‚Äôs missing or if they want to magically produce it by themselves, they can knock themselves out. Yeah.... moral dilemma sigh. Thanks for your advice! :) definitely not gonna falsify or tamper. I‚Äôm just gonna inform the relevant ppl in charge to provide their justification for missing documents or if they can produce it on their own accord.

Whatever they give me, I‚Äôll pass to the auditor without changing anything. The thing is, my boss asked me to be the one to clean up the cases.

Oh and it‚Äôs definitely not shady stuff cuz the rates are fair, just no documentation on how they set the rates for clients.. I plan to do that. Just here to seek some advice before I do. Haha yeah.. weighing whether I should do smth morally wrong or risk being hungry. 

I‚Äôm not hard up for the job but having a few months more of income while stabilising my business would be helpful.. rn being self employed is not paying me enough. Are you an auditor? As a fellow auditor I can get the rationale (workload etc.) but this is not an acceptable advice.

If there is a control deficiency, then it is a control deficiency. It makes it worse when auditors find out companies try to falsify evidence and the FS becomes a Qualified Opinion.. If by cleaning means compiling existing information to verify checks, then should not be an issue. 
If it means forging stuff that does not exist, you might get implicated.. >Hmm legally am I liable for anything if I do clean up the cases for them?

No lar, this one is just external auditors for regular annual audit? If yes then they are just doing routine stuff just to do attestation that your numbers are valid. 

If they don't like what they see they'll just chuck it under qualified report. Really NBD one.. Yes. You have to remember that the CHC people went to prison for exactly these acts even though your circumstances appear to be more innocent.. :) Yeah. That sounds good. Still I am not sure how to react to your boss/director... Ask you to clean up the audit you mean.

You could ask him to clearly define the scope.

It could be his asking you to identify gaps and fix it. Not necessary you fix it.

Actually not having ""how you get the rates"" is shady.. make sure to get everything on writing to cover your own ass. I am, but I'm giving him alternative arguments. Other people have already done a better job of trying to explain what he can do if he decides to go with his conscience. 

Anyway, my job is to find the control deficiencies, not suggest he do things that might result in ruining his livelihood. I've got no skin in the game, so I don't think it's right for me to tell him to risk his job and find the auditors. 

Qualified opinions are something for his management to worry about, not the poor guy who's trying to decide between losing his job and doing the right thing. Don't forget for all our pride about being guardians of the financial world our partners might still look the other way when it comes to losing major clients.. Ooo ok thanks! 

Yup it‚Äôs for annual audit. Was wondering if it‚Äôs considered falsifying of documents since I have to create the documentation to justify the rates , print it out, get it signed by the authorisers, then backdate it.. > Don't forget for all our pride about being guardians of the financial world our partners might still look the other way when it comes to losing major clients.

A bit rich talking about pride. There's been so much shady shit and audit failures over the past 2 to 3 years. The UK politicians have got the right idea: break up the Big 4 gravy train.. What the sellers should be doing is to make documents now to ratify retrospectively the rates and matters for past sales cases. 

&#x200B;

If the auditors find out that you have created documents now that are dated in the past, it causes more problems and they will potentially consider these to be lapses resulting in a qualified report.

&#x200B;

I suggest that you report this to internal audit, especially if you have on email express instructions from your director or anyone. 

&#x200B;

If you are in an MNC, they will look into what the directors are doing.. Back dating of documents is never really a major problem for this purpose. Like I said, you guys are just doing annual audit, not forensic audit for something that went wrong. 

The entire purpose of this audit is just for the auditors to be comfortable with your booking of income statement + balance sheet. And part of the reason they recommended certain other checks and balances is so that the auditor don't have to dig deeper to be comfortable that sales numbers are correct. 

They will be able to identify false declaration of income/revenue via other means such as checking bank balances and other transaction history including checking with some of your clients for verification of invoicing and delivery. But then again this type of audit is not meant to check for frauds anyway.. I would recommend you to never falsify, backdate, or forge any supporting documents that do not represent what the actual transaction is at that point of time. (i.e. If you print out rates at a later date that is actually very close to the rates of the date itself, it's okay because tbh we can't tell, we can only recalculate to ensure it fits), or if it's something that isn't time sensitive such as registers. However if something that was REQUIRED at the point of time isn't present (i.e finance head approval for purchase order) and we found out that it is subsequently printed and backdated, it could be considered a red flag and much more testing will be done around it which could potentially result in quite a big mess.

To answer your question, if your director wants you to do the above, then either u can just suck it up & do and hope your auditors don't find out or whistleblow I guess. If I were you I would do what the director says BUT I'll rat on to the auditors anyway so I don't have to keep committing fraud to cover my bosses ass.. Rich? As far as I can tell what I wrote above agrees with you. Auditor can be very proud but in the end there's a lot of history to show that their work is still lacking. As long as audit fees are involved a lot of issues can and will get swept under the rug.",1943.0,6,275,1

There are exposed small drains in every carpark, can't expect the government to cover up every single one of them perfectly for the 0.00001% of the population who falls into them once.. People who just complain that it is passing the buck is dumb.

It's called deparmentalizing.

The response didn't say go away. Not my problem. It wrote, we refer this to another group of people. And that is still internal to Gov.

If not your scope of responsibility, you will say ""I'll take care of it""? No, you forward it to the right group of people.

People who finds the correct people to help you is doing their due diligence. Tai chi  is not the same thing.. As a cyclist, he shouldn't have been riding so near the curb anyway. Should have been riding about 30cm outside of the double yellow lines.

In terms of drainage, the drain covers with grates parallel to the road are much more efficient at draining water compared to grates that are perpendicular. See attached video for comparisons for various grate designs. 

 In before, subsequent future post commenting the road is flooded due to inadequate drainage capacity.. I'm no drainage expert. But take this from a dude who likes cycling on roads way more than pavements. Quit riding on the yellow line. Don't ride to it's left. You can keep to the left of the road without riding the line.. why would you cycle along the yellow line so close to the kerb anyway

notice that the wheel is stuck at the end away from the road, thats way too close, accounting for the side-to-side sway when cycling its just a matter of time before the front wheel hit the kerb

in any case they probably manufactured a whole bunch of these drain covers and they worked just fine for most parts, the best they can do is really just feedback to designers for the next iteration, honestly nothing much they can do

its like a minor minor defect and making the entire nation change everything. get a fat bike. Diagonal  patterned gratings were introduced in most countries for this very reason - to prevent cycle wheels getting caught out in this manner. 

In this case, the gratings did not provide much cover.. Cyclist should be more aware.

This hole is too big for the grate. That size of gap is sufficient for an animal feet to slip in.

A young kid may push their hand / arm through and then become a problem as well.

Also not good for heels.

Can be fix one.

Some of these type of hole has additional plate to cover gaps.. Get a bigger tyre.. Lol at the response. Gahmen robot indeed.. Standard Singapore response: Pass the buck/responsibility and any possible blame/action on to somebody else.. Government robots again with the ""it's standard one, not my daiji, suck it up"" zero-empathy response, and of course with grammar errors.. at least they didn't recommend you to use a pmd instead. What ever happened to the no wrong door and no wrong number that PM promised 2 years back?. It wouldn't have mattered. Look closely. The guy got his wheel stuck between the edge of the grate and the concrete opening.. As a road cyclist, due to heavy traffic, car swerving etc, sometimes you just inevitably end up near the curb. 

wheelchair users, playful children, can easily get trapped by these drain grate gaps. 

just eliminate these killer gratings gap.. Even if ride on yellow line or on the grille itself also safe.. It's designed to work well when next to a curb. Most people wouldn't be riding 3cm away from the curb. But looks like they used the same grating in a driveway leading to the road. So it becomes much easier for someone to cycle into the gap.. His not using slim road tyres (25-28mm), those are hybrid/mtb tyres, easily 50mm. Plenty thick already. I am surprised that he was able to get them stuck in the first place.. It is no wrong door. 

They referred OP to another department internally without OP needing to do it himself. 

The other department will follow up with OP.. He was just not aware.

176,S‚Äôpore Gojek driver allegedly forces 11-year-old girl out of car after discovering caged pet bird with her. (Mother made a police report),djglhj,2019-10-18 02:04:40,notexthere,44,0.86,57.0,"Shouldn't the mother use Grabpet? Don't think you're allowed to bring pets on regular private hire services. Or at least insert in the notes that you're bringing a bird on board when you book, so that the driver knows and can decide wether to accept the job or not.


The driver is a douche for leaving the girl like that but the mother is an idiot.. Ah ha, I found the Gojek T&Cs--kids are not allowed to ride alone. Both the mother and the driver were irresponsible. Mother should not have booked a ride for the daughter alone. And the driver should have rejected the girl passenger to begin with, even if there was no bird. He will be fired, even if there's no police case against him.

What can a police report do at this point, other than taking up police resources to file? Unless they want to bring the driver to magistrate court, but the driver did not violate any law.. Mother is stupid for: 

A) Not booking Grabpet 

B) Letting her kid go without money or phone 

C) Filing a police report 

Especially when shes in the wrong for sneaking a caged pet bird into the vehicle that's not meant for animal transport in the first place. 

But with the number of missing young kids on the rise, maybe driver shouldn't have just kicked her out :s 

Then again... Gojek driver isnt exactly in the wrong. What if the bird shits all over the car, smell lingers, feathers flying everywhere. The mother isnt going to pay any cleaning fees incurred cause once the ride is over, it's not her problem anymore.. the driver quite baddie for not allowing to drop the girl back at pickup point...

but police report... really ?. Lots of entitled folks. Wish Police have a choice to accept/reject ""complaints"".. Of course the driver will be pissed, you broke the rules and brought a freaking pet on the car. Its only a 15 minute walk, can't be too far to warrant a police report. Girl also knew her way back, which is likely why the driver left without calling the parents/police.

Driver had to pay for the parent's mistake by cancelling, which we all know will incur some penalty. Dumb fuck parent still have the nerve to report to police and lodge a complaint.

Based on the info leaked by the Aunt (dumb fuck dont know how to censor postal code is it?), the car is expected to travel straight down the road with no turnings. At that timing 2030, there would be a sizable traffic which slows down the travel distance of the car, with 2 big cross junctions.

Driver probably told the girl to just keep walking straight and look to the right for her house.

Distance is 900m MAX walking distance, taking 13 minutes. IF the girl doesn't have to stop for traffic light to turn green. She'd take longer if she need to, and thus the walking distance would need to decrease. This assumes that the child boarded the car at the side of the road instead of within the car alight area (needs time to turn back out), that the child returns home the moment she steps on the boarding point (realistically still need to take lift and stuff). All those would decrease her walking distance, and how far away the car got before making the girl alight.. > # S‚Äôpore Gojek driver allegedly forces 11-year-old girl out of car after discovering caged pet bird with her

1.0.1 | [Source code]( | [Contribute]( I enjoy learning all the thing you guys like filing police reports about.. These Gen X-s really anything also want to make police report lmao.... Initial investigations suggest that fowl play was involved. How'd he not see the bird cage at first though?. Lol... another case of irresponsible parents. Still remember how we used to take public transport by ourselves in pri school? How the heck is an 11 year old without phone or $$ on her in 2019?. I get not wanting to drive with a pet on board, I own 2 pet birds and have been denied access on taxis before when bringing them to a vet so I mean, whatever, I get being uncomfortable or wanting the car to stay clean. But?? How the hell do you not notice a bird in a cage at the pick up point???. What a shit life for PHVs need to deal with so many Karens.. Driver‚Äôs totally not in the wrong, even if it‚Äôs a young girl in this case! What if the driver has some bird phobia?. [deleted]. Doesn't matter if the girl is 11, 16, or 25.

What sort of parents let their kids out without a phone (even a 'dumbphone' with no internet) or emergency cash?

If I'm not mistaken, for Gojek, the driver absolutely has the right to not accept the ride with pets, and if the passanger sneaked the pet without giving the courtesy to inform the driver, then IMO booting the passanger is fair game.. How is the driver a douche? He never agreed to take a pet on his vehicle. it states that the person who booked the Gocar shall ensure, which would sound like the person will bare all responsibility. driver implicitly shouldnt allow minors, and does not bare any responsibility for the minor. i would feel its just a rule to protect drivers/gojek responsibilities. 

the driver did his fair part to not allow the pet... though not nicely. he could have inform the mother/aunt beforehand, or drop the girl off back where he pick her up. he need not spur vulgarities on the phone.  i would feel the whole issue is blown out of proportions by the mother/aunt ‚Äî please share (viral) + police report. its just poor attitude/service from the driver. 

i am not sure why you insist heavily on the driver being at fault for breaking some rules or deserve a heavy penalty (various comments)... have you thought of the repercussions? **if** all drivers enforced no minor alone...

many parents uses ride hailing app to save them time instead of sending/picking their children to/from school (thats how much trust is established ‚Äî faith in humanity). it is more accountable than traditionally flagging down a taxi, as you can easily GPS the location, note down the vehicle number in history (in case losing items in car), and make payment. ALSO, it tends to be cheaper than school buses if shared by 2(+) students i think. school buses are an ass in terms of pricing and time efficiency. lastly, minors are below 16, meaning all sec school student still could not use ride hailing as your stand?. In some countries, this could fall under child endangerment. At the same time, one could argue that the mother was also culpable for putting the child alone into the rideshare car with no money, no phone, and a pet that could get her ejected.

I  have pasted the relevant section of the Singapore laws below. I think it's open to interpretation whether the driver and/or the mother acted in a way that was ""likely to endanger the safety of the child"".

 []( 

**Ill-treatment of child or young person**

**5.**‚Äî(1)¬†¬†A person shall be guilty of an offence if, being a person who has the custody, charge or care of a child or young person, he ill-treats the child or young person or causes, procures or knowingly permits the child or young person to be ill-treated by any other person.

(2)¬†¬†For the purposes of this Act, a person ill-treats a child or young person if that person, being a person who has the custody, charge or care of the child or young person¬†‚Äî(*a*)subjects the child or young person to physical or sexual abuse;

Well all the police can do is ""noted with thanks"".. Check SPF facebook page if you want to see how ridiculous Sinkies can get. Simi sai also want police to settle for them.. The result of growing up in a nanny state. They think the police is there to help settle their personal disputes.. It's hard to turn people away because people (understandably) see it as their right to make a police report. But what happens most of the time with this sort of cases is that there'll just be no follow up and it quietly dies. A police report is just an official record of your complaint anyway, nothing actually *has* to come of it.. People in SG expect the police to do customer service too, what to expect?. Based on the report, the daughter reached home at 2045. The distance is probably even shorter than that.. He did pick her up and travelled a distance, at least just send her back to the pick up point. She is still a child and he is the adult. It's just civic behaviour.. Bee Hoon not warm.... powlice!. Boomer logic. Driver apparently chickened out of providing a ride and the mother of the victim flew into a rage. I don't think that simple of just a cage. Maybe the passenger used a large bag to carry the cage ? Like this ikea bags? If I was the driver I won't think of anything if I saw a large carrier.. Bird flu. Bird droppings. Bird feathers flying everywhere because the bird is in a stressed environment (enclosed space, possibly aircon blowing on the bird, motion sickness in a moving car etc) and starts fluttering around. 

You can‚Äôt take chances as a driver. You don‚Äôt know how clean the animal is, and you have a responsibility to your next customers that the cabin is clean and not full of dust and feather from an unlikely source. All you need is one customer to be allergic or sensitive to the remnants of the bird and get a reaction, and you‚Äôll be liable for anything that happens next if the trace it down to you allowing a pet onto your car. Don‚Äôt take chances man. No means no, just book the grabpet if you have a pet with you how hard can it be?. asthma or allergy can be very serious. the driver may not be suffering from those, but the next passenger just might (hence the rules do not allow it)... from that point of view, the driver is doing his due diligence in the matter.. Classic self-entitled person.. Agree but the issue is the driver already picked up the passenger. That is consent and later made the girl exit the vehicle without the consideration of a civilized human being. I too agree with points being brought up that the mother was an idiot for not hiring the proper services and providing proper measures for the child.

But in the competition of who screwed up worse, it's the driver this time. The age does matter if you're dropping someone off in the middle of nowhere.. He could have dumped the bird cage (like at a bus stop or something) and taken the girl to her destination, and explained to adults where the bird could be retrieved.

He could have called the person who booked the ride to tell them that he won't drive her further because of the bird. But he will wait with her at Blk XYZ until someone fetches her. At the very least, he should have called Gojek headquarters to ask for advice and they may have sent another car to deal with the situation safely.

Dropping an 11 yo girl at night in an area that she may not be familiar with is a really rotten thing to do. If something had happened to her, the driver would have been in deep trouble.

But in the first place, I'm not sure what the regulations and company policies are with regards to unaccompanied minors traveling in rideshares. In America, Uber, Lyft etc do not accept unaccompanied minors because of liability from issues like this occurring. This case may force Grab and Gojek to clarify and enforce rules about children traveling alone.. I see. Thank you! Learned something new. But this is quite a stretch, as the driver dropped the kid on the side of the road.

So if my parents send me to walk to school alone when I am in primary school, on the way I was mugged, will they fall under this?

To be honest, the mother is also at fault, because she let her child off, on a car with a contracted stranger, without phone and cash?

So if the child is let off at the final destination, and something happened to her, the onus will fall upon who?

As such, this is quite a stretch.. i think under no circumstances you can ‚Äútransfer‚Äù custody, charge or care of a child from **parent to a public transport driver.** the driver is a stranger and responsibility is anything traffic related, thats about it. 
special needs such as pets, elderly/wheelchair, or whichever all have different specific service for them. even those, i wouldnt say there is a transfer of care... the service just offers accessibility. 

at best it could be applied to your own private engagement with a school bus service only.. I took into account the time he travelled as well as the time the girl would take to walk back. Total 15 min with 2 min car and 13 min walk.. Apparently a small concession for an 11 year old child is beyond the understanding of most redditors here. Some argue legalities and complete disregard for civic mindedness, to the extent of reasoning age doesn't matter. It bloody well matters when she's 11.

They just can't reconcile opposing views where no doubt the driver was well within his rights, he could've done better, and should've done better. 

If redditors can't somehow understand empathy for an 11 year old child despite the mother's failings then I may as well already be living in cutthroat China without an actual takeover.. I have no doubt that if the girl was willing to ditch the pet, he could have driven her. The problem is if the girl is willing to do that? By offering to drive the girl back it will be that he consents to transport pets in his car, this is different from when he was unwillingly doing it.

Once he done that, what would be the difference between transporting the girl back to pickup vs to her destination?. Orange juice no pulp... powlice!. I have severe allergies and yet I won‚Äôt risk a young child on the road. Geeezzzzz this is what adults do?

Is there evidence that it is an allergy case?. U too!  I won‚Äôt ever risk a young child on the road.  Think first before reacting so badly as an adult. > the driver already picked up the passenger. That is consent

No. 

If you require special accomodation you should sound out first to the driver.

The driver may have consented to giving a ride, but not having a pet on board.

For all you know he might have an allergy to feathers and furs and literally cannot take any exposure to pets. 

It's kind of shitty that this happened to a child, but the booting of truant passangers is something that I think must be defended as a PHV driver's right.. The driver consented to the ride thinking it was just a girl. I'm sure he did not consent to the girl and pet. If he doesn't make the girl exit then what? Wait in the car with her shake leg? If it was me also, I would ask the girl to leave and continue my business too. But perhaps call the mum to inform and pick up where the girl was left. I agree it's not clear cut.

> So if my parents send me to walk to school alone when I am in primary school, on the way I was mugged, will they fall under this? 

No, if your parents had practiced the route with you or otherwise ensured that you knew the way. Mugging would be super unexpected.

Both the mother and the driver went against the Gojek terms and conditions, which do not allow a minor to take a ride alone. So the driver should have declined the job once he figured out that the intention was for the girl to travel alone, bird or no bird.

It's entirely sensible for rideshare companies to have rules like that, because as you say, who's at fault if something happens to the kid on the way up to the flat or whatever? A proper ride service meant for kids would have to have safety precautions to ensure that someone signs off on the kid getting into the car, and someone else (pre-arranged) signs off to receive the kid at the destination. No dropping the kid off at the carpark alone. 

We have no idea if the driver in this case took any measures to ensure the girl's safety. Like if he dropped her off within sight of her starting point (i.e. she can't get lost), or if he asked her if she knew the way home, he would be in the clear. If he just kicked her out without caring whether she knew the way home, he could be in trouble.. Why are you so incredibly incoherently mad?. Just because u have many allergies and never had a reaction to birds, doesn‚Äôt mean someone who has never known to have had allergies would one day start reacting to bird related allergens. Adult onset allergies are real, you can gain allergies later in life. Don‚Äôt forget asthmatic people who might get an attack due to the bird feathers and what not.  


Also, Give the child some credit. She‚Äôs 11, I know that there are kids younger than her who return home from school everyday on their own. I was one of them, kids are more independent than you think. They‚Äôre able to walk on the road, take public transport and travel from place to place on their own without getting harmed. Singapore is known for our safety. Kids also go to road safety park at around this age so they do know about keeping themselves safe when on the road. 10, 15 minutes of walking for a kid means the distance is not very far. 

Not forgetting, If we really want to blame someone, blame the mom. Especially when you want to argue about letting the kid risk it on the road. Why did she allow the kid to step into a stranger‚Äôs car all alone in the first place? So what if it‚Äôs grab or a taxi? What if the driver was a horny pedophile? If u want to be so protective of the daughter, travel with her instead of making her lug her own birdcage onto public transport all alone then complain about it on Facebook when something happens.. > I have severe allergies and yet I won‚Äôt risk a young child on the road.

If driver had allergies to birds, he might crash and result in both their deaths or more. That's not a risk?. Look, as I said, I agree with most of the details which are for the driver.

Ultimately an 11 year old is a vulnerable individual, and that is the most pressing issue of the day not to be tallied with a bunch of what ifs.

You simply do not leave an 11 year old helpless. The mother's just as dumb as I conceded before. I'm even surprised I have to explain this.. Allergy-prone patients will have their inhalant and epi-pen if you are unaware. They will know their remedy. Unless you are again stretching the facts to say the driver may be unaware. Sigh.....

Honestly u are just pulling all sorts of info just to fit your argument when it is not even in the picture. If you start including unrelated factors it is surely not a sound argument. Then others will pull unrelated factors to support the mother‚Äôs action. 

U have made it sound he was driving in a jungle area with infected birds 

Too sad..... The girl was able to walk back to her house in 15mins don't think she was helpless. It wasn't that far off and she clearly knew the area well too. >You simply do not leave an 11 year old helpless.

Morally yes, legally not needed at least in Singapore context.. Dude u need to stop projecting your own experience as an allergy prone person. Not everyone is like you. What if someone forgets their pen or inhaler? What about those who are not allergy prone, but somehow they have reaction to allergens from avian sources? What if the bird is not well groomed and is harboring disease? Everyone is at risk. Please train up your analytical thinking and open up your horizon, don‚Äôt just think about how you do stuff but think about how every action affects the greater community, the risks they introduce especially in an environment shared by the public. Because your question was about what harm can a bird do in a public transport. Not what harm can the bird do to specifically just you.",4073.0,22,1,1

178,Let's redefine multiculturalism for a truly inclusive Singapore,djfrzy,2019-10-18 00:59:29,notexthere,2,0.67,5.0,"did he just compare rohingya issue with the brownface saga here.  

We live in a country that is committed to celebrating our  multiculturalism. It is my favourite part of being a Singaporean, and  living here after years abroad - my group of besties are made up of  Indian-Catholic, Indian-Hindu, Malay-Muslim (Sunni), Chinese-Christian  and Indian-Muslim (Shi'ite). An executive search consultant remembers  that I once said I would not be interested in career opportunities in  Hong Kong, China or Taiwan because there are just too many people like  me there!

At a 2017 symposium on conflict and peace-building, Home Affairs and  Law Minister K. Shanmugam insisted that ""we should never allow  xenophobia and majoritarianism to override the protection and guarantee  of equality to minorities"".

I cannot agree more.

Yet, we are constantly reminded of how majoritarianism fuels  unconscious biases and discrimination against cultural minorities for  having different values and beliefs. This discrimination can take many  different forms, institutionalised or through casual interactions, and  is not an uncommon sight around us.

The Rohingya minority in Myanmar are systematically deprived, given  their lack of citizenship rights, with severe limitations to their  freedom of movement and poor access to education, employment and  healthcare. It was heart-wrenching to hear many stories of atrocities  and persecution, especially from children, when I visited the refugee  camp in Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh last year.

Closer to home, the recent ""brownface"" saga and the Institute of  Policy Studies (IPS) study that showed slight increases in  discrimination showed that we cannot take our social cohesion for  granted, reminding us all that mutual understanding and respect between  different races is still a work-in-progress.

So I started wondering: What would multiculturalism look like if we  switch to the lenses of minoritism? Who are our cultural minorities,  beyond race and religion? And can we truly be inclusive just being  multicultural or do we need to do more?

#### CULTURAL MINORITIES IN MULTICULTURALISM

First,  there exists a plurality of ethnicities within the ""Others"" category of  the official ethnic categorisation of CMIO (Chinese, Malay, Indian,  Others). Many Singaporeans are unaware of the rich diversity of our  sizeable ethnic and cross-ethnic communities of Eurasians, Jews, Arabs,  Parsis and Armenians who have been living in Singapore for generations.

Members of these ethnic minority communities routinely endure a lack  of understanding of their cultural practices and lifestyles, and even  their looks as they do not look Chinese, or Indian, or Malay.. He's saying they stem from the same thing, he's not comparing them in magnitude..  rohingya issue is wayyyy more than just culturalism. That's his opinion, I'm just explaining why he brought up the two cases.",462.0,8,1,1
179,"Why keep 377A, according to Critical Spectator",djfkbo,2019-10-18 00:42:02,notexthere,0,0.35,31.0,"What does 377A have to do with Drag Queen and all that? And what the fuck? If children see clowns reading story to them, suddenly the aspire to be clowns too? ü§î Also and MOST CRITICALLY, gays gonna be gays. You think they will suddenly turn straight and produce kids?. That pseudo intellectual again lol. Actually the  worst thing you can do is to post his articles and give it more airtime than necessary on an additional avenue like reddit.. Extremely biased article despite claiming early on in it that ""both sides are right.""

Just to name one:

> Since gay marriage does not serve a reproductive purpose it is therefore not equal to a heterosexual relationship

???

I don't think I need to point out how preposterous this statement is.. this is just a troll

if you read his other articles, he didnt just advocate to keep death penalty, he advocates to EXPAND death penalties for smaller crimes

then the next week, he wrote another article prefaced with ""this is his most controversial article yet"" on LGBT issue which basically says ""lets listen to both sides""

how is an article that says ""lets listen to both sides"" controversial? he is annoyingly sarcastic

he is a foreign national who regularly comments on SG issue yet is wasnt considered foreign interference, o rly?. Stop publicising this asshole's articles please. If your intention is to boost his view count and hence his clicks and ad money then well done, if not stop feeding the troll. >In other words, we‚Äôre no longer talking about what two people do in their bedroom but what millions of children are being taught in schools at an especially important and fragile time in their approaching adolescence.

What a lovely slippery slope.

>One of them visible in the West today is an attempt at normalization of transsexualism and the queer theory, supporting the idea of gender fluidity.

It's funny - the ones with the most knowledge about transsexuality or gender dysphoria don't seem to be making as a big deal as all these 'concerned' conservatives. I wonder why.

>Or with informal initiatives which grow in popularity, like the ‚ÄúDrag Queen Story Hour‚Äú, featuring men dressed up as women reading stories to children

Oh the horror! I'm *totally* a drag queen because I grew up watching Kumar on TV!

>Activists don‚Äôt care about the real conditions in which gay couples live in Singapore today ‚Äì free from any persecution and arguably being the safest and most prosperous in the entire region.

TIL Pink Dot claims otherwise. Oh wait, they don't - they just realize that 377A represents a form of institutional discrimination that should be repealed.

>respecting the will of the majority

Just over 60% of those aged 18-25 already support LGBT rights. It looks very likely that there will be an overall majority in Singapore who support it in a decade or two. Let's hope he respects this argument when that time comes.

>and tolerant approach

Funny, as a member of the LGBT community, it certainly doesn't feel that way. Things like the Wear White movement, truelove.is preying on the vulnerable/helpless (seriously, is anything protecting children from being forced into that program by their parents?), attempts to take over AWARE, campaigning to have LGBT-themed books removed, brigading HPB to remove their fact-based FAQ on sexuality *only* because it said homosexuality is normal and certainly all the various petitions to ban performers like Adam Lambert - are these actions supposed to represent tolerance?. So homosexual marriages are worth less than their hetero counterparts because they cannot produce a biological child? What about infertile marriages,where one or both of them are incapable of having a child? Should we say they are worth less based on their inability to naturally reproduce? Or marriages where both sides choose not to have kids. Is that also worth less? 

I also fail to see how two men who were drag queens who turned out to be sex offenders means that's it for normalising LGBT. NUS has produced so many sex offenders but we don't talk about closing it down.. oh hey, are we still bothering with this crack pot, shovel this shiat next to whatever cesspool xx is in as well. Hi comrade. Oh fuck off. What a load of crock. Pretty sure 99% of all sex going on now don't serve a reproductive purpose anyway.. Can Shan the ~~sham~~ law minister to get Focus on the Family SG and We Are Against Pink Dot SG to come clean? No? Then the law minister and his fellow party members are charlatans and duplicitous. While this pole (capitalisation deliberate) and ~~whitewasher~~ ""focus on the positives and spread positivity"" Nas Daily are welcome with open arms though not Singaporean, Alfian Sa'at, Kirsten Han, Jolovan Wham, and Thum Ping Tjin, all Singaporeans, are subject to constant character assassination, a characteristic action of the ruling party against those who they deem a real threat to their power. Is this what one gets as critics who are loving? While lovers and groups with an agenda that aligns with the ruling party are given free reign, even though their actions might lead to a long-term decay?. I watched Joker and suddenly I want to be a clown.. Didn‚Äôt read the article but he isn‚Äôt entirely wrong although the probability of a person becoming a drag queen in a society that oppresses them is very slim. 
  
All you gotta do is ask yourself. Why are there still clowns? Why do some (not everyone) aspire to be a clown? Why do kids aspire to be a teacher/pilot/doctor? I don‚Äôt know the intricacies of their psychological motivation but I know that the probability of a person becoming a drag queen in a society that glorifies them, does not oppress (or treat them with disdain) is not zero.
  
Edit: that being said, there is nothing wrong in becoming a drag queen out of your own volition.. you know how people with repressed urges project their self hate outwards. Technically the truth, since a gay relationship is not the same as a hetero one. But it also isn't really applicable in today's society where there are options like adoption if the couple wants a kid. In fact, based on that alone, a gay relationship is beneficial to the society.. what about couples who are infertile? they can't serve reproductive purpose so should they be illegal? 

wtf sia logic. Agreed. I am constantly amazed how this random guy from Poland is apparently a legitimate political commentator, while someone like Kirsten Han is a traitor to Singapore. 

And now, people are going to likely view this article (that looks like it was written in an hour) as being a valid ""opposing view"" to the 75 page legal article written by a former chief justice of Singapore. 

Thank god it's Friday, at least.. And what‚Äôs the issue with that?! Yeah, you call them drag queens but look another way they are also performers and artists. I don‚Äôt see the issue frankly.. Doesn't the above mean, from a purely functional viewpoint, that a gay relationship is more beneficial than no relationship but not as beneficial as a heterosexual one, and hence original statement may be correct.. Oh yeah, I actually literally just edited my comment. 
  
Edit: I‚Äôm just replying you cause I didn‚Äôt read the article. The simple logic, ‚ÄúI see clown and therefore I wanna be a clown‚Äù is not wrong. Hence technically the truth. It's like saying that durain doesn't produce juice, hence it's not equal to an apple. 

Please, don't tell me there are durain juices out there.....  []( 

If you can make whisky I'm sure you can make juice. 

Anyway, I think that the issue here is the having a child is an option but not a certainty for heterosexual relationships. There are also straight couples who just cannot have children at all due to medical reasons, but for all purposes the law and society treat these infertile comes as equals to other fertile couples. 

Clearly the differentiating factor (if there is one) is not fertility, since society already treats fertile and infertile couples equally.. Of all the fruits to pick.... Absolutely cannot imagine what that whisky tastes like....

Don't really agree on your last statement. Most ppl I know, treats couple with infertility issue with a certain amount of pity. Perhaps that's the main issue with a gay relationship, that certain elements of society cannot understand why something that should be pitied, is instead actively embraced. Does that make sense with the biological imperative? Absolutely. Does that makes sense with the world as it is? Oh well.. Low hanging. It probably tastes horrible. 

I also think gay people would be totally fine with being pitied like infertile straight couples, while also having all the legal rights and privileges that these infertile straight couples have. 

The article suggests that because gay people are infertile, this is one reason that supports gay people receiving different legal treatment, and so 377A can stay. Whether people pity infertile couples or not is really quite different form the fact that infertile couples enjoy the full legal rights of any other straight couple.

If you don't like the example of infertile couples, then well how about fertile couples that decide not to have children? They are treated in exactly the same way as couples that do have children. There isn't even this sense of pity that you refer to. 

Fertility and child bearing thus clearly are not the real basis for discrimination here.. Didn't read the article cause it doesn't seem to deserve time spent. And my statement was addressed at the redditor above me so... 

That said, in general, I agree with you that, in this time and age, using the fertility issue as a barrier to deny marriage rights is kind of insane, as it is happening nontheless, and the pressure of not having kids now isn't the law, but the expectations of the older generation.. I sadly skimmed the article and you are right it's not worth your time.. I think it's not worth anyone's time tbh.",1676.0,7,1,1
180,"People who can‚Äôt speak their Mother Tongue, how do other people react to it?",djf2om,2019-10-18 00:01:52,"I feel that Singaporeans of the younger generation in particular it‚Äôs surprisingly fairly common to find people that have trouble of not unable to speak their Mother Tongue. I know because I‚Äôm one of those people myself and just say that I do get criticised by others at times and it is fairly challenging to talk to people of the older generation. I remembered when I was a kid my parents even scolded me for always speaking English and not speaking my Mother Tongue at all (which is Malay). So people with this same problem, how does it affect your life?",81,0.93,132.0,"My chinese is weak. Passing grade only back in school. Thankfully in my workplace, English is the dominant language. When my poor command of mandarin is mentioned, my go to excuse is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm peranakan‚Äù which is somewhat true as I do have peranakan ancestry in my blood and peranakans are known to be bad at Chinese. Then sometimes I get the compliment ‚ÄúWah then your chinese is good for a peranakan cos most peranakans I know don‚Äôt know any Chinese except their name‚Äù. Or I get the question ‚Äúoh so u speak malay?‚Äù And I just say ‚Äúa little bit‚Äù and throw up some Malay words I know from my limited vocabulary. Then people are mostly convinced by this excuse.. I can speak Chinese conversationally just fine, but I basically cannot write beyond primary 2 level.


It's fine. Not really affected at all. Not like I'm planning to go to China any time soon.. Went to a interview with Bank of China for a tech role. Interviewer speaks everything in Chinese, including technology terms, business terms and the what-not. Apparently conversational Chinese just doesn't cut it anymore, so I noped the hell out of there.. A lot of my chinese friends are ok with conversing in chinese but they would rather speak English if they are able to. Most of them come from English speaking families and the only time for them to practise their MT is during MT class. The problem is that teachers are doing the speaking most of the time and the english speaking ones would just keep quiet throughout the whole lesson. How liddat.. My malay is pretty bad. People poke fun at me but hey, I passed O level mother tongue. So it doesn't bother me too much.. *[Memories of being treated like a race traitor in poly come flooding back]*

Good times.. I'm a Chinese who failed Chinese at O'levels. I can speak it for conversations' sake I guess but I can't write Chinese for shit, I'm more English educated. Haven't really faced any problems so far tbh.. As someone who is only able to order food in Chinese, I've worked in companies that deal mainly with China cos. Foreign colleagues were happy to assist with translation but clients mostly spoke English. 

Only rando aunties/uncles scold me for being Chinese but not being able to speak the language, despite the fact they're the ones asking me for directions.. I think it‚Äôs almost a norm that the younger generation can‚Äôt speak their mother tongue. I‚Äôve even heard 5-6 year olds speaking with an American accent because of Netflix/YouTube. In my social circle, people aren‚Äôt negative towards non-mother tongue speakers. And in fact look up to those who can speak them.   
&nbsp;  
FYI, ‚Äúnot unable‚Äù is a double negative.. i grew up in an english speaking family because both of my parents were educated and met abroad. the way chinese was taught (which relied heavily on rote memorisation, lots of weird civic/moral value stuff) really put me off studying it as well. eventually i was sorted into the CLB class because my scores put me within the bottom 5% of my cohort oops. 

thanks to my exposure to c-pop aka Âë®Êù∞‰º¶, i always maintained a very general interest towards the language. it's arguably much more poetic and goes in deeper than english and i genuinely admire people who can are truly bilingual. i personally find it a bit lame when people are vv proud of being 'only good at english' lol it's 2019 colonial hangover much.

without giving too much personal details away, i ended up in a role where i serve PRC clients almost exclusively. i obviously hid the fact that i could barely speak mandarin lol and just went along with it. it's been 4 yrs since and now i'm relatively adept at business mandarin (i review chinese documents and interact with my clients directly).

did it affect my life? no. i think if you put your mind to it (and if you're being paid to do so), you can still pick up your mother tongue. if anything i think it's a real pity that the younger gen is losing grasp of their MT. being effectively bilingual gives you an undeniable edge in the job market/future prospects imo.. Depends on how you define ""mother tongue"".

Based on your question's context (""how do other people react to it?""), I assume you mean ""the native language of my *perceived* ethnicity"" (the modern frequency of mixed marriages throws a very large monkey wrench into this somewhat racist view), and ""other people"" means ""everyone except family"".

Despite being the product of a pure-Chinese marriage, my parents spoke only English at home (unusual for the late '60s), so my L2 Mandarin skills were execrable. They only began improving a decade ago, when my business partner forced me to admit to our Taiwanese customer that I'd accidentally deleted a critical file in their production systems. Fortunately, they were able to recover it from a backup...and I thought, ""hey, this Mandarin thing ain't so hard after all"".

As to how people used to react to my incoherent Mandarin...mostly shrugs and a switch to (often-broken) English. I haven't really encountered any negative reactions on this matter, perhaps because not many folks relish being an asshole to a pleasant guy who smiles a lot.

\+++++

That said, my personal definition of ""mother tongue"" is ""the common language of your *elder relatives*"", i.e. what your grandparents, uncles and aunts use in daily conversation with each other. This is a more natural and stable concept than the fiat choice of some external agency (""Your NRIC says Chinese? You learn Mandarin."") In my case, that's Hainanese, and I speaketh it not. At all.

And because the ""other people"" in this context are ""your own blood relatives"", the reaction is...not good. No overt sneering, to be sure, but no throwing Junior an English-language bone either. Getting shut out of family conversations because you don't speak the lingo is a special kind of hell.

My paternal grandfather, bless his heart, strove mightily to address this by taking English lessons. He actually made surprising progress in reaching out to his eldest grandson, before a heart ailment brought his efforts to a crashing halt. After all these decades, I've still not quite been able to forgive myself, for not learning Hainanese to meet him halfway.. I get more shit from Singaporeans and Malaysians for not speaking Mandarin compared to the Chinese. Heck, I am in Beijing right now and I straight on use English and most of the time it's not an issue (of course, I haven't been in a situation where the language barrier has been so great, so fingers crossed it stays that way). Heck, just yesterday one guy at a reception pulled out his phone, asked me to say what I wanted to in English, had it translated into Chinese and back to me. Even my basic as heck Chinese knowledge knew the translations sounded like crap but it got the point across. 

When in China, my go-to line is always ""ÊàëÁöÑ‰∏≠Êñá‰∏çÂ•Ω"" and 90% just smile and say that even the words I know sound really good. 

Sure, there are times where conversations are in Chinese and there'll be laughter and I'm there with a blank face. It's all good, I tell them. Yes, it sucks that I don't understand even the gist of it but no tears should be either way. 

Anyway, there are times where I wished my folks taught me and siblings even their own dialects but ultimately I just go on by with my life. 

P.S. though, I will say that learning Chinese is important and my son will attend classes, definitely. It's just that beneficial, be it in every day life to business, Chinese is a great language to learn.. I can speak Mandarin at an intermediate level but news / drama in Mandarin is too tough for me to comprehend. I do get flak for it sometimes but I retort that I speak English at home and people are generally understanding. But I can imagine that it'd be tough if you absolutely can't speak your mother tongue. I've a friend who is half ang moh and half Chinese but he can't speak a word of Mandarin though he looks more Chinese. He gets flak all the time from hawkers.. I got B3 for my chinese in O level, and stop using the language other then to communicate with my parent. Now my chinese is deterioted to the point that i can no longer capable to write proper chinese sentences. Still can read though.. People would judge me. It sometimes can be shown on how they react.. So my MT is chinese

My dad is English and I lived in the UK for 10 years sooooo safe to say my spoken Chinese is awful, and written is non existent.

But I can still understand 90% of what people actually say in Chinese. (Super fun to earsdrop on conversations that people assume I can‚Äôt understand) 

People always act shocked when I can understand and reply with simple answers.. *you Chinese cannot speak Chinese ah, Âæà‰∏¢ËÑ∏*
Meanwhile in my head, reminds me of this meme 
 I'm half chinese and since no one spoke mandarin or didn't want to teach shit about anything related to the language in my family (well, the only speaking person is my.. dad.. and he kinda doesn't really give a shit about his kids so..), my knowledge on it is basically piss poor- also doesn't help I have dyslexia,,,

My Chinese side is kinda obvious so people tend to talk to me in Mandarin instead of English at first,, I can't hold any conversations with people and it ends up with me usually just nodding along and walking away when I can- it's really awkward cause I just kinda shrug in response to anything they ask and don't really seem to get the hint that I literally don't understand what they're saying- 

it's pretty sad at family reunions ngl. my parents were educated overseas so don‚Äôt speak mandarin, it was really tough learning it growing up and i used to get made fun of cos my pinyin was weird. never used chinese until i started working, i think i can manage speaking 80% of the time. the rest of the time, i just pretend i understand only. when it‚Äôs really essential i‚Äôll say ‚Äúsorry i don‚Äôt know what that word means‚Äù and actually people will explain it :‚Äô) i have to say, when i was younger i would always get scolded for not speaking chinese but it‚Äôs much less now. don‚Äôt know if my chinese is actually improving or i‚Äôm better at pretending that i know what‚Äôs going on now.. I am ethnically Chinese, but don't speak Mandarin. Can't speak it/understand it for the life of me.

But I speak dialect fluently :) Sooooo, I guess that means I can speak MT?. Not being able to have a decent conversation with my grandmother for 10+ years, how about that

She only speaks Hokkien. Was asked if I'm not from Singapore cos of my superbly horrible pronunciation of Mandarin hahaha FML.. As someone who comes from a mixed background I'm expected to speak at least 2 languages however I make sure everyone knows I speak neither of my mother tongues. But I have never faced any discrimination at all. Rather people get really impressed when I can recite the Chinese version of our pledge. My dad call Chinese descendants who can't speak Chinese, [È¶ôËïâ‰∫∫]( (üçå human). I've never considered Chinese as my mother tongue.

But when it comes to Chinese, I have no problem writing or speaking. But I may need refresher when it comes to business terms like Ëß£ÂÜ≥ÊñπÊ°à and ÂÆèËßÇ/ÂæÆËßÇ„ÄÇ. I speak Mandarin/dialect at home, HCL was a breeze in primary school, subsequently went to a SAP school, HCL was mediocre and I just scraped by for HCL O Levels, and almost 3 years since then the number of Chinese characters I've written (exclude texting) is probably 1 sentence long. 

There simply hasn't been a need, obviously I still converse in Mandarin sometimes, but my written proficiency surely has dropped. My level of conversational Mandarin is more than sufficient for communication on a daily basis, but I sure as hell can't talk about anything technical or advanced unlike in English. It could be worse I guess, at least living in a Chinese speaking household gives me opportunities to continue speaking it. I speak my Mother Tongue (English) just fine :) Overseas, my lack of fluency in Mandarin is met with a bit of surprise and amusement, but that's about it.
I'm not proud of the fact that I have abetter grasp of European languages than I do Mandarin, but it hasn't been for lack of effort.
I learnt more Mandarin in Australia when I took it as a conversational course because for the first time in my life it was being taught as a *foreign* language and I understood the teacher :D. i‚Äôm chinese, but i‚Äôm exempted from taking since young due to my autism (on the mildest end of the spectrum), so i‚Äôve never been exposed or educated abt it. it‚Äôs honestly so distressing and embarrassing for me to explain to everyone that i can‚Äôt speak. i can‚Äôt communicate to my grandparents at all (and i severed the potential of a good relationship). i get anxiety everytime i have to order food, because i literally speak the most minimal amount i picked up over the years. all the aunties and uncles chuckling / scolding / harassing me whenever i can‚Äôt answer them is incredibly daunting and frightening. 

i feel so distant towards my asian heritage since i can‚Äôt understand anything, except for english. my classmates will always commented how i‚Äôm so fortunate to have lesser subject, not experiencing the turmoil, skipping lessons and the constant Cs everyone gets from taking chinese etc etc but i would‚Äôve go back in time to pick up the subject in a heartbeat. it‚Äôs been so detrimental to have this barrier that i cannot overcome within my atmosphere, and it‚Äôs going to affect me with future employment etc. 

it sucks. appreciate your mother tongue.. Huh? Even malays younger generation is this bad? Around 15 years ago, in my school Malays always had the best results among the mother tongue(100% passing rate for O' level), we were always lamenting on how malay is so much easier than chinese or tamil.. I'm a Chinese who speaks Malay so all the aunties and uncles will speak to me in Chinese and I look like a total idiot. It sucks a lot because not once has anyone in public talked to me in Malay so in a sense I feel quite cheated ://// but then again, my Malay isn't so great lmao.. The first few months in SG:
I am very Sorry, I can‚Äôt speak Chinese, Wo shi Thai guo ren

Six years later:
I am speaking English and IDGAF

Maybe it‚Äôs just easier when you don‚Äôt understand anything they said.. I just find it sad that most Singaporean Chinese, especially the younger generation can‚Äôt really speak Mandarin or other dialects. The most depressing part is that some of them are actually proud of their inability to speak their mother tongue and still maintain this ‚Äúso what?‚Äù attitude.. My chinese is so bad that I got a U grade for N level chinese. My uncle every chinese new year will tell me that china will take over the economy so everyone must learn chinese. But i wonder, most of the world are english speakers so either all of them have to learn chinese or china have to adapt the english speakers. 

If people tell me I'm not a true chinese because i can't speak chinese then too bad, why should i care? As long as i've got a way to communicate it's fine with me. Better than learning a language to communicate with those kind of people.. I still rmb the time when a china auntie ask for help from me. And i spoke in broken chinese and the lady scolded me saying chinese dont know how to speak chinese. I'm half English half Chinese.. so technically English is my MT since that's what every of my family members speak? My grandparents on my mom's side don't even speak Chinese, just English and Teochew.

So, no one really tries to talk to me in Chinese or expects me to thankfully.. I used to do fairly well in Chinese. After 'O' levels ended, I didn't need to study Chinese anymore. Fast forward to many years later, I've forgotten the bulk of written Chinese characters.. probably besides my own name and the simpler words.. Don't worry about how others would react. Just make some time to learn Malay or Chinese. Over time you'll pick up the language. üòâ. My Mandarin isn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs definitely understandable, but usually garbled with English and spoken in a very ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù accent. Not sure how to describe it myself. 

Some time back I worked part time retail. There was this PRC couple (based on their accent) who spoke really fast. My natural reaction was just ‚Äúhuh, could you repeat that again?‚Äù They stomped off chanting something along the lines of... such an embarrassment, for a Chinese person who doesn‚Äôt understand common speech (putonghua).

I‚Äôm currently based in Australia. Funny thing is a couple of PRC mates over here were quite shocked that I could speak mandarin, even after they knew I came from Singapore. I couldn‚Äôt even give directions to PRC tourists in proper mandarin, so yeah there‚Äôs that. üôÉ. meh, if go by race none of my immediate family can speak our mother tongue (my grandmother was adopted into a family of different race so didn‚Äôt learn her ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù mother tongue). 

yes people are always confused by us.. I just avoid using it outside cuz my Chinese is that bad, not really affected by it mainly cuz I don‚Äôt eat at hawker centre and stuff.

I don‚Äôt even consider Chinese as my mother tongue considering I speak Cantonese Everyday at home anyway.. aRe YoU a ReAl InDiAn??!!1   


\^mostly this. Picked up conversational chinese tho, so I think I just didn't pick up tamil because I hear it less frequently.. my written chinese isn‚Äôt that bad, but i rarely practise speaking so my fluency is kinda off. some uncles or aunties in public would often ask me translate things or give them directions in chinese and i sometimes have trouble doing so, and one time an uncle questioned if i was a local, lol. My ""mother tongue"" isn't one of the official ones so I just anyhow do Malay lor. Which I didn't do so well in at school but at least can speak conversationally now. I'm pre-empting this for my son by sending him for Malay classes before P1. 

Nowadays at least I think they teach Mother Tongue without assuming it necessarily is a Mother Tongue- the problem back in the 80s and 90s was the assumption of prior fluency (teaching a mother tongue involves very different pedagogy from teaching a second language).. Member of the older generation here - 45 years old and my wife constantly laughs at my attempts at speaking mandarin. My dad is peranakan but actually I grew up speaking Cantonese and English at home due to being raised by my Cantonese speaking grandmother. 

I hated learning mandarin in school and scraped through my O and A level mandarin. My generation was the xinyao era but I steadfastly refused anything to do with mandarin pop culture because I hated that it was forced on me as a mother tongue. My mother tongue is Cantonese dammit.. Thankfully poly doesn‚Äôt need mandarin anymore, but genetics blessed me with some features that made my classmates thought I was from China when they first met me :( 
Had to visit Chinatown for a school trip once and out of nowhere, a Chinese shopowner asked me if I was from China too :( 

Old people always speak to me in mandarin, to which I try to respond with severely broken mandarin or tell them I can‚Äôt speak the language. Either way they‚Äôll say I‚Äôm a disgrace to my race :(. I can only speak very basic chinese, flunked my chinese in PSLE (got a U grade) but coasted through O & A levels thanks to CLB (Chinese Basic). It doesn't affect my life too much as my friends & family speak English mainly and my workplace is English dominated. I struggle to order food at hawker centers though.. One day I was walking along on my merry way then this Chinese national (probably 60+) was looking for directions and asked me for help. I tried to speak Chinese to my best ability (I am horrible at chinese) and suddenly he commented along the lines of ""you should go learn Chinese properly now, Chinese Master race soon."" Like holy f***. I think everyone should be able to speak their mother tongue. If you can't, you probably live in a high SES bubble.. Losers. We are taught to be bilingual. If you can't speak your mother tongue, I am sorry but your linguistic ability falls short.. For everyone discouraged from learning mandarin, don't be. I was put down intensely by my ""Chinese"" speaking classmates for even trying, but after making a lot of friends from China, brushing up my mandarin immensely, I realise that near 100% of ""Chinese"" spoken in Singapore is completely wrong. Go read comics in Chinese, watch China dramas, read Chinese novels (recommend  ÁõóÂ¢ìÁ¨îËÆ∞ or  ‰∏â‰Ωì), but for the love of god, don't learn it from other Singaporeans or from mediacorpse.

Singapore Chinese is shit, even our dialect is shit. Most people can't even speak hokkien properly, which is why it sounds so vulgar. I'd say 99.99% of Chinese Singaporeans can't speak their mother tongue, the only question is if they're aware of it or not. The entire Chinese side of our language is passed down form one coolie to another, which is why its so bad.. Why can't you speak Malay? Unless you're mixed race it should come to you easily no?

Bagai kacang lupakan kulit :). I'm technically also peranakan and my Mandarin is bad too, but I've never thought about using this...flow of reasoning.. That's my other go-to line when someone presses me further on this topic, haha.. Wah still pass? I failed cHinEse  lol. Just got back my secondary results and I scored 0/10 for a section. It was memorizing phrases and I somehow blanked out during exam. I‚Äôm orobabaly not gonna know how to speak. I‚Äôm fucking using this. China is coming to you. :(. Increasing Chinapore influence. I've seen a PRC who didn't speak any English, scolding an Indian guy selling goods at a stall for not knowing Chinese. That's sad.. I went for an interview in a rather large local firm and China is one of their main markets. So the interviewer told me that I'll be spending a significant amount of time travelling to China for work. He asked if I was comfortable with that and I said I was as my conversational Mandarin was still alright. After that, he took out a piece of paper and a pen and asked me to write a sample report in Mandarin. I was stumped as the last time I actually wrote in Mandarin was during my ""O"" Levels. With a laptop, I might be able to write something out with the help of hanyu pinyin and Google Translate. But with a pen? 

Unsurprisingly, I didn't get the job.. BOC doesn't mess around many of the bosses are PRC (obviously) including those based here. Conversational might get you by but if wanna rise there you absolutely must be able to speak Chinese well. That's one role you ain't getting then.. Mine is totally opposite. Even my friends who ended up in Chinese B class rather speak Chinese (even after one of them went to UK to study full time for 3 years).. I. Me too. But I do try to speak Malay when I have to. I can still order food in Malay so that‚Äôs still something.. Seriously, don't China realised the more they expect all of us to confirm to their ""greater China dream"", the more resentment they generate. This has little to do with colonial hangover and more to do with the flaws of the bilingual policy. Also, LKY basically forced the Chinese majority to learn Mandarin so we wouldn‚Äôt segregate ourselves into our respective dialect clans.

We gravitate towards English because of our education system which was created decades ago when LKY wanted us to remain competitive in a world where English was (and still very much is) the lingua franca. 

I don‚Äôt think being only good at English while neglecting our MT is anything to be proud of but to chalk it up to colonial fever alone is very simplistic and doesn‚Äôt take into account other more significant factors. 

Otherwise I do agree with the rest of what you said. Being able to speak Mandarin well is a massive edge in a world where China are beginning to flex their economic muscle. I don‚Äôt speak Mandarin much at home because my parents communicate with me in English and Teochew with each other and my dad is Cantonese so my Teochew and Cantonese is on par with my Mandarin even though I didn‚Äôt take any formal lessons in those dialects. Agree. Being truely bilingual is an admirable skill many say they have but can't actually pull off. If you want to talk multilingual, we're actually much behind. Many Europeans speak 2-3 languages ontop of English with skill it's amazing.. Same here. My dialect is more fluent than my mandarin.. Yellow on the outside white on the inside yeet. It's called coconut for Indians. Brown on the outside, white on the inside.. I‚Äôm autistic too which is most likely a factor on why I have difficulty speaking my Mother Tongue. But I still can hold my own when I want to order food in Malay. Some of the Malay uncles and aunties do wonder why I sound awkward when ordering food.  But it is hard to have a conversation with someone in Malay.. yeah i agree. i don't think it's anything to be proud of, really.

just a counter-example: when i was attending networking events in london, someone asked whether bi/multi-lingualism would be an advantage in the job application process. one of the angmos replied ""oh i can only speak english, i'm not even good at it and i got a job"" and cue laughter. i think it's sad, quite ‰∫ïÂ∫ï‰πãËõô„ÄÇ. I‚Äôm part of the older generation now - born in 74. My dialect is more fluent than my mandarin due to speaking only dialect and English at home for most of my life growing up. The only time I use mandarin now is when ordering food and I‚Äôm fine with that. I have no emotional connection to the language, I consider Cantonese my mother tongue.. these terms are not wrong but different country will use different words for the same thing.

Even simple thing like an orange, in Taiwan, it's called Êü≥‰∏Å. While in the mainland , they called itÊ©ôÂ≠ê. Would you like to tell all Taiwanese that they are crazy for calling their orange differently?. It's sort of like French in France and French in Quebec. There are bound to be differences.. I wouldn‚Äôt say those Chinese vocabularies are wrong. It depends on the location, like how Malaysia‚Äôs chinese, Taiwan‚Äôs chinese and China‚Äôs chinese are different. One example would be the ÈªÑÊ¢® and Âá§Ê¢®.

But I do agree on making friends with mainland Chinese. I‚Äôve learnt a lot of day to day words and phrases that school doesn‚Äôt teach. Most of my Chinese friends were nice enough to explain to me when I‚Äôm lost or confused.. Chill there bro. There's regional differences in languages and languages evolve, like how singlish evolved from English and borrowed words from regional languages and culture. Although both region has some vocab differences, both are generally mutually intelligible. Same thing for Cantonese for example as compared to canton and Hong Kong. 

And before bashing anyone for poor mandarin, you have to understand that it is not our lingua franca and general fluency will definitely be worse than China. A better comparison will be to compare our mother tongue mastery to mainland Chineses' 2nd language like English.. Lol. This is stupid. Even in China itself, there are different dialects with their own vocabulary and pronunciation. You do not live in China, you live in Singapore. Singapore has its own English as well as Chinese. It‚Äôs called colloquialism. 

Even in Taiwan, ÂûÉÂúæ is not pronounced as ‚Äúla ji‚Äù, it‚Äôs pronounced as ‚Äúle se‚Äù. So are you saying the whole Taiwan is in the wrong because they don‚Äôt follow China‚Äôs pronunciation?. ËØ≠Ë®ÄÊ≤°ÊúâÊ†áÂáÜÊÄßÔºåÂè™ÊúâÂú∞ÊñπÊÄß. > I realise that near 100% of ""Chinese"" spoken in Singapore is completely wrong.

omg dude have you never heard of regional diversity.. Would you say that either American English or British English is shit?

Lift vs elevator

Lorry vs truck

Trousers vs pants

Football vs soccer

Chips vs French fries

and thousands of others.. OTOH, the way we speak is our way of speaking. Language is ever evolving. We do not have to conform to a distant authority unless we are intending to converse with them. Amongst ourself we can speak however we want.. >Êñ∞Ë•øÂÖ∞ not Á∫ΩË•øÂÖ∞

does that mean we should be called ""New Gapore"" instead :(

or New York should be ""Êñ∞Á∫¶"" in chinese?  :( :(

guess we've been lied to by the evil West :(:(:(

> which is why it sounds so vulgar.

even hokkien in china have regional variations.. it's like saying ÂõõÂ∑ùËØù is shit becos it's almost hard to catch by most who speak ÊôÆÈÄöËØù. Before criticising Chinese Singaporeans for not speaking their mother tongue well, you may want to watch [this video]( Different regions (including China) have different words for the same thing, like taxi. It is called ËÆ°Á®ãËΩ¶ in Taiwan, and ÁöÑÂ£´ (dƒ´sh√¨) in HK/Macau. There are many language variants, like Northeastern Mandarin (‰∏úÂåóËØù), which differs slightly from Putonghua in terms of vocabulary and pronunciation.

Almost every Chinese Singaporean is bilingual, but in different language standards. There are Chinese Singaporeans who can speak Mandarin relatively well, as they expose themselves to the language daily, or they are interested in the language and culture. Some have weaker command of Mandarin, probably because they do not use Mandarin frequently. Saying 99.99% of Chinese Singaporeans cannot speak their mother tongue is not correct as most Chinese Singaporeans can speak their mother tongue. They mix in English words from time to time, but this does not mean they cannot speak their mother tongue.. Read [this](

Languages are living things. They evolve and change with their speakers.. Lol what logic is this?  
What if the household.....just prefers speaking in English? Can‚Äôt expect the kid to have good Malay then can you? Brown skin doesn‚Äôt give one a natural affinity to speak the language.. My mom pumped lots of hard earned cash into giving me chinese tuition. I had to show some results eh.. hahahah. China is coming for you.... FTFY. A lot of them assume they are entitled to the same treatment here as they will back home just because we have an ethnic Chinese majority here as well so any Chinese national that comes here feel they don‚Äôt need to adapt and learn English. 

This is an issue and idc if anyone calls me xenophobic but those Chinese immigrants need to be assimilated to our culture and respect non-Chinese minorities.. Not cool man ... Jeez the entitlement. Not great when foreigners come into Singapore thinking that knowing Mandarin is sufficient. Worse still is that some locals don't mind alienating non-Chinese locals to this issue.. WoW. That's something new.. I used to work at a popular tourist attraction and one time a family from China blew up on me because I couldn‚Äôt speak or understand any Chinese (Because I can‚Äôt even understand simple Mandarin phrases so all dialects). 

It was extremely embarrassing nonetheless.. And they said ""Chinese privilege"" is a Singaporean problem. Heh. Well, try explaining technical terms like APIs and SQL in chinese. For the bulk of us who study computing in the English language of instruction, this isn't something you can just pick up quickly unless you have been working in a team full of China Chinese for quite some time.. This sounds ripe for to be addressed by legislation if it hasn't already. There is no fundamental reason why an IT support person would need to be able to speak Chinese. Creating this requirement is bad for our society because it walls off our Malays and Indians from opportunities. If a company wants to do this to our domestic politics and culture, they need to be looked at closely.. i think it really just depends on the preferences of your group of friends. my friends all prefer to speak English and most of my bf's friends prefer to speak Mandarin. (both groups are chinese by race). Here's the thing, *they don't.*. U can choose not to believe them?. i appreciate your point; am very much aware colonial hangover is much too simplistic an explanation, but personally wasn't interested in veering off-topic when i wrote my post (i.e. why are some people proud of being exclusively english speaking). in any case, it is 2019 and i don't believe being exclusively english speaking is an asset. 

my parents speak cantonese to each other as well, so i grew up being able to understand it (so i could eavesdrop my parents better!). unfortunately my lack of practice means i can barely speak it, and when i do, i have an extremely heavy accent, so i've been told. i personally wish i could speak dialect a lot better so i could communicate more effectively with my grandparents.. It's great but.. you need to keep in mind

- the environment Europeans are in is a lot more conducive to becoming fluent in multiple languages: they probably speak their native language(s) to those who can, and speak English to those who can't. And when they go on the internet, they probably consume a lot of English content, simply because the vast majority of content on the internet is in English[[ref]]( For us Singaporeans, we only need English.
- European languages and English are all part of the Indo-European language family. Now, that does not mean it is easy to learn English if you know an I-E language, but it _does help_, compared to us S'porean Chinese who have learn a language that is in an entirely different family, and that is considered one of the hardest to learn for native English speakers. Add onto the fact that many of us use English nearly all the time and, unless our families speak Mandarin at home, basically only speak in Mandarin when ordering food or in MTL classes, and it becomes really hard to be fluent in Mandarin.

  There's really no way around it. To be fluent you need to use the language, and to use the language you need people to use it with.

  Oh, and for those of us who are native* English speakers, our ways of packaging ideas and constructing sentences are shaped by English, which will naturally suit languages that do so in similar ways... which again, are the other Indo-European languages. You ever notice how you can tell what a non-native English speaker's native language is by the idiosyncrasies of their English? That happens to us in reverse when we speak Mandarin.

\* [_Native_]( is a _technical_ linguistics term, referring to the language(s) that a person has been exposed to from birth, and are comfortable and fluent in. See [here]( for a generally-accepted definition in the context of multilingualism. Contrast this to the way our government (ab)uses _mother tongue_. Some S'porean Chinese have Mandarin as their L1. Some have it as a heritage language: spoken initially at home, but relegated when English comes into the picture in school. And finally, for some of us it's simply a second language. I would wager that the latter group is probably becoming the majority, and so it's not technically right to call Mandarin our ""mother tongue"" anymore, at least if you want to abide by the technical meaning of the term.. i think we're quite fortunate to be exposed to two languages throughout our schooling yrs (namely english + MT... or more if you're hardcore and went to MOELC). most angmos i knew when i attended uni in the uk could only do english and some of them weren't even very good at english. if anything, i lament the way chinese is being taught in our schools. given the right set of conditions and better standard of teaching, i'm quite sure i would have done a lot better in chinese (since my inherent interest was there alr).. Most European languages come from the same root and it is easier for them to learn other. For example, it is easier for a German to learn English because they have same root, and even easier for him to learn Dutch. Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Italian are similar as well, I believe. While it is admirable for European to be multilingual, it is not that amazing.. we get each other!. Not really. I'm sure the French can still somewhat understand French is Quebec. Or the Spanish to understand the Mexicans Singaporean Chinese is worse than our Singlish. Singlish is still somewhat understandable if watered down. Singlish is an actual language with its own rules. Singaporean Chinese is not. It sounds like a toddler blabbing with half made up words. Its embarrassing really. As a rule, I never speak Chinese to Singaporeans, I don't want to affect my language ability in Chinese by speaking to them. To Singaporeans,  its Singlish, or at worst, English to those who want to act atas.. Woah woah, don't try to act atas by speaking english hor. You should just be a good self-loathing sgean like op, and speak the one true form of your MT from your ancestral land, so you can tell everyone else how superior you are.. China IS you. I personally don't feel that you are being xenophobic. In a way, Singaporeans are told/taught to respect other countries' cultures when we travel or move to their countries. Likewise, we should be given the same respect. Not only language in my opinion, but our culture too. If one moves to any country, shouldn't it be basic knowledge and respect to learn and be within the culture? If one wants to only be stuck in one's own culture, one should just stay in one's own country. I am saying this not only for the Chinese foreigners but any foreigners who go to any countries.. Beyond it not being cool, it‚Äôs going to breed a lot of resentment in Singapore‚Äôs Malays and Indians in time to come. And the government will be responsible for it, because by allowing this to happen, they are reneging on the constitutional protections afforded to minorities. Especially to the Malays. 

Why should Malays and Indians care about being Singaporean if the future Singapore is an alien place where the tongue that binds us all is no longer spoken? Why not just move en-masse to Malaysia or Australia and leave Singapore to the PRC colonialists to do with as they please?

Did we not learn about Sri Lanka in social studies to avoid becoming like them? Sri Lanka imploded because the Sinhalese imposed their language on the Tamils, who had been there for thousands of years (some say even longer than the Sinhalese themselves). This is proof of the fact that it doesn‚Äôt matter how long you‚Äôve lived in a place, it‚Äôs not a guarantee of your continued survival or enfranchisement. And who knows what the future may bring. 

Everyone that comes here needs to learn English. Singapore is multilingual and they can speak in their language if their workplace is dominated by their compatriots, but English must be a necessity if they are to navigate the common public space.. I don't think PRC is what they are referring to when they coin this.. I find this strange since even some technological jargon is said in English, at least in my experience. I guess this is more of an integration thing with the team than anything else.. It really depends on the clients the IT company supports. For my case, we do support quite a large number of users in China and also we get our hardwares for our clients from China too. So it makes sense for the IT support person in our company to know how to speak and write in chinese.. > am very much aware colonial hangover is much too simplistic an explanation, but personally wasn't interested in veering off-topic when i wrote my post

Better to leave out an explanation than put in a poor and controversial one.. And to further elaborate I rarely if not almost never watch any TV shows or movies in Malay. Like I know so many Western movies but when you start mentioning Malaysian or Indonesian movies I‚Äôm as lost as a small boy in a jungle. And when other people talk about ‚ÄòMalay‚Äô topics I‚Äôm usually very lost and tend to be quiet which is the total opposite of my usual personality.. I have an actual close friend who grew up in Quebec and speaks quebecian french so natively the locals thinks he's a white Caucasian over the phone.  

He has visited France and there's a big difference between the French in france and Quebec. The quebecian speaks like the French equivalent of back country mountain top farm hick compared to Parisian french. Courtesy of the type of immigrants from France to quebec back in the days. 
Even he has a hard time communicating with the Parisian french. It's funny he got more side eye looked down with his Quebecian accent then the rest of the normal tourist. Lmao this dude bragging about being fluent in ""THE one and only correct form of Mando"", complaining how sgeans speak shitty versions of Chinese, and then saying people who speak English are just trying to act atas. Talk about irony.. Could I just ask what exactly the government ought to do about a PRC scolding an Indian guy for not knowing how to speak Chinese?  It seems to me that it's simply a business transaction where one party is being very unreasonable but the other party can simply refuse the transaction.. Same, in my experience technical terms like acronyms usually stay in English even when talking to the Chinese. The tech guys there themselves continue using the English acronyms since that's what many of them are familiar with too it seems. That would indeed make sense. On the other hand, if an internal IT department of a Singapore or a company who had something like 50% local clients wanted the same treatment and wanted only Chinese speakers, the government should really take a closer look at them.. i think most people, especially millennials are in your boat. i‚Äôm not caught up with politics, the latest chinese dramas, blockbusters etc and i‚Äôm sure many others around me don‚Äôt.. What are malay topics? Are you referring to political topics referring to life as a malay person or malay pop culture?

I don't listen to malay songs or watch malay shows either. But my excuse has always been that I like Sci fi and fantasy.

There's not a lot of malay Sci fi shows out there.

I did watch cicak man though. That was quite funny.

I've been trying to find malay language things that interest me. But I do it a bit half heartedly
I'm doing it to try and not be biased. At least less biased than I am now.

How can I shun entertainment made in this one language when I'm open to listening and watching things in a whole lot of other languages.. Because I've seen Singaporeans go to UK for holiday and come back with an american accent, and vice versa. Singaporeans go for what's trendy and cool rather than what is right and genuine. Either you're real street smart and speak illegible toddler-level Chinese, or you're real atas, and speak with a vaguely western accent you ""learnt on TV, and spent like 3 weeks in Australia"" Can't speak like a normal human being, or behave like one either.. > Could I just ask what exactly the government ought to do about a PRC scolding an Indian guy for not knowing how to speak Chinese?

By addressing the root cause: By mandating that PRCs that move to Singapore and that intend to live here for the foreseeable future learn conversational English before getting a work permit/EP.

Virtually every foreigner that moves to Singapore needs to speak English to get by. I don't see why PRCs should be treated specially. The fault lies squarely on the government for creating the impression in the minds of PRCs that Singapore is a Chinese settler-colony, or an extension of China itself, where they can live in sterile bubbles and treat Malay and Indian Singaporeans like outsiders.

The social contract that was agreed upon when the Singaporean nation-state was formed - the social contract that binds us all - emphasised on equal opportunity for all, obviously barring exceptions in the workforce where knowledge of a certain language is a requirement (eg: for businesses with strong links to China). But if Malays and Indians continue to find themselves shut out across every strata of society, that social contract will have been surreptitiously rewritten without the consent of all parties. And then Singapore as we know it will have ceased to exist, and the likes of Mahathir will have been vindicated. 

This will not end well. Not for anyone. A nation's social compact exists because of its social contract. Rip up the latter and the former ceases to exist.

> It seems to me that it's simply a business transaction

See, it goes beyond a single business transaction gone sour due to language barriers between a local and a foreigner. Working-class Malays and Indians are already finding themselves being shut out of low-wage/mid-wage jobs in Singaporean businesses because of the ""Chinese only"" requirement. This has been happening for *years.* There's a reason why you find *so many* working-class Malays and Indians in pink-collar/red-collar government jobs, like in polyclinics and the national health service. It's not because it's their preferred vocation - it's because state employment is often the last resort they have.

It's employment apartheid in all but name. And what happens when you've got all of this already happening, and you add non-English-speaking PRCs to the mix? It compounds the situation and makes it worse.. Some tech terms in business requirements documents are still in Chinese though, it took a long time for me to translate and understand a single document.
    
And I spent quite a few minutes wondering what H5 was, and it turned out to be HTML5. True. And another thing to add is that I‚Äôm not familiar with Malay songs either. Like I know dozens of English songs and know how to sing them perfectly but I‚Äôm Super lost if you talk to me about Malay Singers or bands.. I would say both in terms of pop culture and political topics. But I do watch Malay dramas on Suria if it‚Äôs interesting and I will watch Malay language movies of it seems interesting. There was a Malaysian movie based on a boy with autism and I really enjoyed it as it portrayed autism very well and is a good way to educate viewers about it. And tbh I don‚Äôt watch things in other languages that much. I don‚Äôt watch Kdramas at all and I don‚Äôt really watch any Thai or Japanese movies and shows unless someone recommends me and I find the plot interesting.. Ok, but why do you care so much about how other people speak though? If you want to speak mando from mainland China, no one's stopping you. Just don't blame other Singaporeans if they don't understand your presumably one true form of mando.

You despise other Singaporeans attempting to speak with an American, Australian, or English accent in Singapore because they supposedly can't speak like a normal human being, whatever that even means. Yet, here you are acting all self-righteous about you being able to speak mainland Chinese mando in Singapore, where there are significant noun and vocabulary differences that most mando-speaking sgeans won't know what you're saying. Heck, how do you even know those sgeans speaking with a western accent haven't made tonnes of western friends, and consumed tonnes of western media, just like you did with mainland Chinese friends and media?. We get your POINT 

you don‚Äôt need to keep repeating like a broken CD playerü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Thank you for explaining it in such detail. This is really disturbing that the gov isnt doing more to solve this problem. Switzerland has a mandatory programme that is paid for by the Government to all foreigners, regardless of the job.

Don't attend it, no work permit.

It is the best country i have seen in integrating foreigners into the Swiss culture.. Hear fucking hear.. Good answer! Thanks.. I have a lot of PRC coworkers who don't speak english at all. Yes they have EP and live in singapore right now. So fucking sad man. lol i'm not even anti-establishment but for this the PAP can go fuck themselves. lmao.

yeap, her religion does not allow sex before marriage. the religion rule does not apply to you but her (a muslim). 

i strongly don't recommend it just because im a fellow muslim. but i can't control you or her.

sorry if my english bad. Yeah.. ""asking for a friend"" but forgot to change topic

To OP, just get the 5* hotel punya room, no officers would raid Hyatt for example.

It was agreed by all parties then (Umno, MCA, MIC and the British) and became part of the Constitution.. Mahathir said "" Make up your mind"". Because we believe that no person can serve two masters.. I don't have an answer, but rather a related question, is not allowing dual citizenship that uncommon?. Jus soli. I think. Around 45% of countries doesn't recognize dual citizenship.. mostly centered around countries that isn't the west.

Malaysia forbids, they WILL make you choose between Malaysia or the new country

Singapore outright expels the person that has a dual citizenship. Soli boss. My mistake.",147.0,6,8,0

My bet is the person in charge of this project most probably some office guy who works in Marketing dept in ASNB. He is the one who decides which set of photos to be presented to the boss. He probably hired either some budget friendly upcoming photographer or some guy he knows personally who owns a DSLR. Then he possibly micromanaged the whole shot and the photographer in his mind would probably says ‚Äúi am not paid enough for this shit‚Äù and just clicked the camera while the guy directs everything disregarding micro details. This guy probably wanna impress his boss or at least dont wanna fuck up on promotion. Then he submits the photos to the boss to pick and the boss just pick any in random because he have other important shit to do. He probably looked at the whole set for less than a minute and the guy just said ‚Äúthank god he picks a photo so that we dont do a reshoot‚Äù.

16,Queries on Malaysia and Singapore trip,dlbxq1,2019-10-22 03:23:43,"Hello redditors,

I was planning for a trip to Malaysia and Singapore in Dec 2019, just before Christmas with friends. We are traveling from India. Below is brief itinerary. I had few queries which were not easily available on Google. Please help a fellow out.

Itinerary: 
2 days in Kaulalampur, 3 days in Langkawi, 4 days in Singapore - out of this 1 day for Tioman island. 

Queries:
1. We are really interested in Scuba diving. But it seemed Western part of Malaysia had lesser coral reefs and marine life.  So, traveling to Tioman for a day for Scuba and snorkeling exclusively. Is it worth? Is there a possibility of heavy rains and closure of island in December?
2. Tioman was much closer to Singapore than KL or Langkawi. So we're planning to reach Singapore and then via jetty to Tioman. This requires for us to have multiple entry Visa to Malaysia. Is there any viable alternative to travel to Tioman from elsewhere in Malaysia?
3. Do you suggest any other place for Scuba and snorkeling that's as good as Tioman which is near Langkawi, KL or Singapore?
4. We were really interested in visiting Borneo region - Sidapan island etc. But had to drop it because of no easier connectivity/more expensive. What is the best way to travel to Borneo from KL that doesn't burn hole in the pocket?

Edit : Added one more question.
5. Media reports talk about travel warnings about kidnapping in Sabah region. Is that media hype or is the reality closer to the reports?",7,0.86,9.0,"Mersing *Jetty* is the main gateway to *Tioman* Island, but your time period is not suitable, the monsoon would already have started and most resorts closed   


The east coast islands have very good scuba sites, but the monsoon has already started. next visit, you can look at Perhentian island, Redang island etc. nov/dec bad tme to travel here since its the school holidays and peak time for most resorts/flights. air asia is cheapest for linking between kl and borneo. scuba on the west coast is all worse than on the east. 

i've been to kl and langkawi and in MY opinion there really isnt much there to see if you're a traveller on a budget. unless you want cheap booze in langkawi tho the geopark (where they filmed don) is worth the visit. kl is your typical urban jungle. if you want to see our capital you can spend one night here, maybe the day before your flight. 

if you want a good experience sabah (in borneo) if good if you can get there. good scuba off the island of labuan and there's a resort with a very good beach thats reasonably priced (tho maybe i went at the off time). if you're capable can try to climb mount kinabalu. there's waterfalls and a dairy farm in the shadow of the mountain that feels like switzerland from those 90s bollywood movies. 

if you all go to langkawi ping me, i can recommend a good place to eat/stay.. Hey thanks for the inputs. Do u think by 20th December Mansoon would still in heavy? I saw few articles on internet which said the intensity would have reduced greatly in late December. I could be wrong though!. That was insightful. Thanks.

Since it's nearly 2 months to go for travel, we may get reasonable prices in flights on hotels(probably?). Except for the crowd Advance booking can help out beat the crowd right? 

Geopark in Langkawi is definitely on the plan. Beaches in Langkawi must still be in better condition right?

In KL we planned for petronas towers, Batu caves and aquaria.

Did a quick check after ur suggestion to take flight drom KL to Borneo, seems feasible. Budgetwise we aren't too tight or too luxurious. A reasonably comfortable, adventurous, relaxing vacation is what is there on the mind. 

Another big worry is Mansoon. When I had started researching about Malaysia, it seemed like Mansoon would have nearly retreated in December. Does it seem doubtful now?. no. the resorts will all be closed. Langkawi is subject to its own weather so the monsoon won‚Äôt apply.

Monsoon season lasts unti Feb for the east coast islands. These east coast islands will be closed until then so your research that it retreats in December is wrong - by a miraculous reason that the rain lessens, the islands will still be closed. 

Everywhere else in malaysia should be fine to travel during this ‚Äòwet period‚Äô as it may rain heavily in the afternoononly. Check the clouds before you plan any activities.. in Langkawi I recommend Adya hotel for its good breakfast and good location near to a dinner place but it is in town center. if you want to be near the beach find a hotel near pantai cenang or pantai tengah.  you can check your dates to see if there's a discount on your stay. i would say stay in a place that gives breakfast included, might be difficult to find a breakfast place and you can leave the hptel quicker too. 

langkawi private hotel beaches are great but if you go to a public beach it will be crowded (but  clean annd well maintained). it is the holidays after all. 

the problem with sabah is that you need to cover quite a distance. do any of you have an intl license? might need to look into tours if you cant rent a car. of all the places i've been in the country my sabah trip was the best. 

dont worry much about safety, most of those kinds of things happen far away and dont happen much anyway. those militants target fishing boats now.. >Another big worry is Mansoon. When I had started researching about Malaysia, it seemed like Mansoon would have nearly retreated in December. Does it seem doubtful now?

we have several monsoon seasons, end of year only affects east coast, and life is normal everywhere else. Even in the east coast, its only the island resorts that close. On the mainland, life is normal, it just means afternoon rain. Thanks for the recommendation.

No one has international license ATM. Let me check on the feasibility. But, how good is the public transportation? If everything is planned as per schedule, catching bus/train/jetty would be a good idea in Sabah? 

Sabah looks like interesting option. I'm thinking of cancelling Tioman and Singapore from original post and replacing with Sabah. This is in the eastern peninsula. Ot would be leas affected by Mansoon I guess?

KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 21): Australia's Lynas Corp is reportedly resisting making a compensation claim against Malaysian authorities over the matter of costly operating restrictions.

The rare earths producer on Monday voiced out frustrations over its failure to secure approvals to boost lanthanide concentrate processing, as well as the politically motivated attacks in Malaysia, according to a news report today.

Lynas managing director Amanda Lacaze said during an investor call the company had no appetite for ""additional conflict with the government"" as it was subject to frustrating ""political nonsense"", despite doing everything expected of it as a foreign investor and reaching higher standards than those in other industries.

""Suing anybody is always a risky pathway and suing a government is an even riskier pathway, and we won't be doing that anytime soon, particularly not as we are working to build something that is good for us and good for Malaysia,"" she was reported by the¬†Financial Review¬†as saying.

Lacaze also said Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has remained a steadfast supporter of Lynas and wanted to see manufacturing industries develop around rare earths processing and let the rest of the world know that Malaysia was open for business.

Last year, Lynas shut its US$1 billion processing plant in Kuantan after reaching the lanthanide concentrate processing cap. The company said it is keen to avoid a similar scenario after restart issues.

Lacaze said the failure to secure approvals with local regulators was disappointing but the company remained optimistic about a breakthrough before end-December.

""NdPr (neodymium and praseodymium) production at 1,242 tonnes was certainly lower than we would like it to be and lower than we could place in the market, so it is a high priority within our business to resolve this matter,"" Lacaze said.

Lynas said the company saw no roadblocks to meeting the approval deadline for a new home for the waste stockpiled at Kuantan, but it remains unclear if any of the US$42 million in a Permanent Disposal Facility bond held by Malaysia's Atomic Energy Licensing Board can be used toward the cost.

As an SS15 student,I agree. Oh, wait till you see the ~~dogs~~ rats in William's Corner. Even the cats don't even dare to be near them. I just see wealth inequality among dogs in Klang Valley.. Kota Bharu=Draw kambing. Not kidding, very hard to find dog there. Kota Bharu are facing domesticated canine local extinction.. Am from subang and laughed my ass off. We subangites lost the most here but we get to laugh the hardest as well.. What about Kuching?  The cat city is full of fluffy big good bois. Not true tho. Ampang dogs are damn vicious. Got chased by a pack of em few times in Ampang Jaya. Someone tweeted this photo as well and one of the replies said that kat Shah Alam no dogs allowed sign lmao. LOL, that Subang tho. That breed runs wild there.. Thank you for including Kepong.. Klang is the best (‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢). Lol subang at usj4 by the smk got some stray dog go chase one of my annoying schoolmates. Kena bawang by the entire school.. Shah Alam, same as Klang. TIL IAMA Subang native.. Hahaha Klang one is quite accurate. I experienced how the Cheras dogs behaved few weeks back. Chasing cars without anything of care in the world.. Applies to humans in the areas too. Some people regularly feed the pack of strays which sometimes get aggressive around their claimed territory. I don't get why. I wonder if the feeder has considered calling people to catch neuter release them.. Dey where Brickfields?. Klangite here. A friend of a friend once said, ""Klang tempat orang Shah Alam buang sampah"" :/. This is so good. Lol, subang. I don't get the Subang one. So is this like symbolism for peoples behavior, living standards, history in all these places? Symbolism not the right word.. We are not dog! We are monyet-s!. I sort of get this, but can someone explain the qualities of the type of dog in each area?. Subang the best. Klang dog missing a bottle of ThaiSong. Can confirm Subang. wowowowow haram. Why are chickens allowed the dignity of sacrifice to feed human race but not dog?   
Strays are mainly the result of failed ownership.   
Strays caught may be kept for a while for adoption opportunity but when this fails, the dogs are disposed.   
Why not round up the unwanted animals, and export them to Korea?   
People need the money. Dogs can give their lives with dignity.. dat bish a sloot. The sizes of those 'dogs' in Subang are huge!. Some dogs are more equal than others.. that is mainly due to irresponsible ownership,

p.s  i live in kepong. I've seen one and I believe you üòÜ. anjing is haram lol. wasn't there's an issues with rabies?. Subang has too many rats, try walking around ss15 and keep an eye on the ground.. I think it says the rats there are as big as dogs.. [catching and killing is inefficient](

This link is for cats. But same principle applies to stray dogs.

Your suggestion is ineffective, costly and cruel. Get educated on the issue. There's better ways to do things. Hot dogs!!. Hey no slut shaming here. Like their residents too?. But I thought Kepong dogs are more middle class? Like have roof over head + food scraps but chained up all day?

Sauce: Staying near Kepong. As long as the food is good and fast eh?. There was unfortunately. I seen one in pj near fatty crab. Nope the heck out and went out through the front instead of the back. cannot beat klang or shah alam rat though, especially in taman sri muda area. Yet municipal council continue to catch strays and killing dogs that are not adopted. 

Yeah, blame me for it instead of shitty cruel pet owners.   
What a waste of life.. LOL   
People 'created' strays. They also created hot dogs, buy, eat them.   
People also eat chicken, goats, cows, fish, seafood, in abundance. Now they want to vote the other way? :D LOL 

At least the strays will offer their lives to better humanity instead of a meaningless death by dog catchers.. Not slut

This is sloot shaming. Especially near NTS and Sri Kota haha. Did i blame you? I dont think i did. 

I just said your suggestion is costly, cruel and inefficient. 

I recognize you speak from a lack of perspective. Thats why i told you there's better ways to do things and to get educated. 

Awareness is needed. The municipal councils will only change under pressure.. I stand corrected, not you blaming me, but from the votes visible. Not your fault.   


I recognize that you speak from a lack of perspective; that stray dogs are being caught and killed anyway. That's why I did not try to educate you, or the municipal council. Because people cause the dogs to be strays and people who demand the dogs to be caught and killed senselessly, when the dogs could die an honorable death just as chickens do.. > I stand corrected, not you blaming me, but from the votes visible. Not your fault.

I didn't downvote you at first if thats what you're alleging. But i have now cause its clear you're just arguing for arguments sake.

It seems you are extremely eager to have strays sent for human consumption. Makes me wonder what these stray dogs did to you that hurt you so bad. Kena gigit ke kawan. You ran out of facts now trying to get personal.  
Are you butt hurt?. Only disappointed in you. Your 2 previous posts didn't add anything to the conversation. At least if you want to seriously argue your point give me facts on its effectiveness or philosophical underpinnings on why eating dogs would be the better solution.

I mengharap tau for an epic story of how the fascist strays tortured si tompok and murdered si manja mercilessly.. You did not address the fact that strays are caught and killed, regardless that it is costly.   
You also did not address that people slaughter chickens, goats, cows, etc and those animals serve as food. Why not canine?   
I did not mention cats. You seem to garble that in with your source and your source did not generate revenue so definitely not cost effective, DUH.

Don't be surprised when museums are tightly controlled, have high entrance fees, and evokes security all over instead of history. 

Fuck them, that's the lowest of the low, stealing from a grandpa.. This is exactly why we cannot have nice things.. Poor, *pak cik*. 

There's a special place in hell for these thieves.. ""Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"". This breaks my heart. What a good person.. Economic incentive motivation is higher, moral ethics deficiency is lesser importance within the community. IMO, ""pakcik"" can donate his collection to a managed museum which is allowed to curate from time to time. I believe every item in his stash contains a story. Maybe he can employ someone to document them down into a coffee book for sale too. Sale revenue can be use to keep it run a more secure museum and still allow free access. My own spare thought.. My favourite place to go during school holidays 

Now everything is just left memory. This show how broke our society is, damn it! for sure this will happen again.. When people don't value heritage.... This is why we don‚Äôt deserve anything. Reminds me of the red shirt thug who punched a old roti seller uncle recently. If we can't do anything about it, then at least we don't contribute to the problem okay guys. Fuck those people.. We need some justice!. This enrage me! Can we track the thief that stole and sell the antiques online?. My heart goes out to the dude who only wanted to share his treasure with the world. Really sad to see that there are still filthy rats roaming the streets.. Fuck these people.. How low can you be stealing heritage items from the old man??. And this is why non-private museums put everything valuable behind glass cases.

Cos some dickwads will steal anything that is not nailed down.. special space in hell awaits for punde thieves.  
So sorry that this happened to an old man :(  


we DONT DESERVE nice things. we just dont.. >Stolen items being sold on Carousell
Why am I not fucking surprised. How some people can think it is their bloody right to take something that is not theirs to begin with is beyond me.. This is why we CAN'T have nice things.

I genuinely hope the thieves will rot in hell someday.. Fuck those thieves. No CCTV?. Those thiefs should be brought to justice. If all the items can be found again, someone should collect a pool of money to buy them back for him again.. [removed]. [removed]. hmmm....maybe  buy back the items and gift it back to him  

edit - im very confused by the downvotes. whats wrong with buying back the items and giving it back to the curator?. Damn lowlifes are taking advantage over people. I hope they burn in hell for trying to get away with it.. yow chill, no need to bring in hell to the convo; yes they're wrong for stealing but damn shouldn't we control our anger?. Well, too late. All stolen by fucking rats!!!. Truly living in a society, aren't we?. Yes! The fitting punishment would be for them to work the dirtiest of latrines.. Seems like locals considering they tried to resell it on Carousell.... Most likely panjang tangan Malaysians who have no concept of personal property.

We have a few employees like that. It‚Äôs actually cultural.. Racist much?. but.. but... that's what hell is for. punishing the sin of a thief, no?. yow stfu. it's a figure of speech. No. It's how language works. Figure of speech. Phrases. Learn it. Use your head to think once in a while, it's nice. Try it for a change.. You stupid? God forgives any sin you do, but will never forgive the sins you do to other people unless the people you sinned accepted your apology. Have fun finding people you've wronged in the afterlife.. Looks like we found the thief XP. syurga for them then. I just downvoted your comment.

Lol they even cancel their offer to sell their Tejas to us...not to mention the toxic anti-Malaysia wildfire have gone out of control there...India is a lost market.... Why did mahathir even said what he did smh. nvm the palm oil buyers will buy it if no option beside they still able to enjoy 20% cut of profit:

 []( I have a stupid question, is palm oil more lucrative or Durian exports? I know cannot just suddenly plant durians, just curious only.. Not gonna happen.. Take it as a positive. Less rain forests cleared for palm tree. Less migrant workers. More manufacture based economy (hopefully), less agricultural based economy from now on.  We were fine before palm oil is a thing.  We will be fine after it. If we lost India market completely, so be it. We can adapt and survive. 

We don't need a trading partner that is so quick to use palm oil as a leverage over us. If they see it works, for sure IN will use it again as leverage in any diplomatic dealings with MY in the future.  We don't want that, do we? US, EU and AU are more mature in their response whenever they were criticized by MY. That's the mentality and trademark of first world countries, free speech and all.. No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs just how economic sentiments are. Free enterprises still prevails in India and Malaysia. We don‚Äôt have injunctions, export restrictions or tariffs that burden either party.

India is a formidable trade ally and looking at cross ownership businesses, malaysia benefits more. 

We may loose the volatile markets like tourism but that opens doors to other nations and destroys monopolies in the travel industry.

What would really hurt us is loosing the Indian IT expats. They have been a slight decline due to the RM fluctuation but in general western companies it startups in Malaysia rely heavily on them. Their consultants and partners are Indians too and this makes it harder to choose Malaysia. 

Also, idiots Malaysian Indians to go back to India does not help.

Again, this snafu will pass & let the storm pass. Free enterprise will always prevail.. [removed]. For a small farm? I say durian, as for a plantation? I say palm oil. But if it were either of them, I rather plant cocoa and black paper for plantation and melons/vegetables for small farm, more lucrative.. Already happening.... its already happened. it doesnt affect you but it affects many people who rely on this industry. This that downvoted this, do provide your view as well. Genuinely interested to know what did you find unfitting.. [removed]. where?. FYI, the palm oil industry was butchered several times. The government was aware and did not take appropriate measures. While It made lots of sense 30-40 years ago, but times had changed and the economics behind palm oil is on long tail. 

I felt the choosing of palm oil and sticking with it was due to other factors that only one party enjoyed. Yes, many are relying on it, but we have been warned 30 years ago that this will happen ~ eventually. It will be unsustainable and climate change bills is just the knife to the heart.

Some Malays are saying they are baffled that some Malaysians are still not fluent in BM despite having lived in Malaysia for many years or even for a lifetime. How do y‚Äôall feel about this? How true is this? Must it be like that, that all Malaysians speak BM fluently? Is this affecting our unity? (PLEASE ADD MORE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS IF YOU HAVE ANY JUST TO SPARK MORE INTEREST) Speak your mind.",9,0.66,35.0,"Most malays i know speak local dialect or bahasa pasar instead of proper bahasa malaysia.. I hired a new malay staff and the day before she was supposed to start, she sent me this. 

"" Pakcak dah meningal, Satg kita p segambut"" 

forgive me if i wtf?. Non-Malay here. Been mistaken for a Malay when I talk to people on the phone. Was asked several times if my home state is Kelantan (nope, not Kelantanese). 
People who say non-Malays cannot speak fluent BM, obviously haven't met enough non-Malays in their lives. 
Of course there are folks who cannot speak Malay fluently. But there are also folks who speak it fluently. Stop painting us all the same, please.. OK the belief of living in Malaysia for years and needing to be fluent in Malay is just retarded. There are some parts of Sarawak that don't even use Malay routinely, and I mean between everyone.

And to make this perfectly clear, Bahasa Rempit is not Malay. We all learn Bahasa Baku, before saying nons can't speak proper, look in the mirror first and think whether they themselves speak proper. I can listen, read and write perfectly. I can speak Bahasa baku but not Bahasa pasar. I bet my formal Malay is better than most Malay. People look at me weirdly when I speak with a formal accent although it‚Äôs the one we learned in school. You can‚Äôt expect me to understand different ‚Äúloghat‚Äù from different states. I can speak Bahasa Sarawak but that is not considered ‚ÄúMalay‚Äù here and everyone expect me to know the local lingos. 

Most Chinese speak Malay with a Chinese accent but that doesn‚Äôt that they are not fluent in Malay. Just like how Malay speaks English with a Malay accent.. If they cant speak Malay, I speak to them English. If cannot oso I use sign language.. 
Generally we're all well versed in casual BM for everyday lives. If you're talking about formal BM then it's a different story. I'd dare say even some Malays have trouble with it.. language are very often tied to the perspective of the people and culture. if the people are looked down upon and culture are inexistent . expect people to show zero interest or even reject. Even malays speak malay wrongly so I think we're all the same though. Here I am speaking BM as how I learnt in school and people complain ""Apasal skema sangat?""

I've been in peninsular since uni and now working here, and I still can't get the hang of ape, saje, etc...

Whenever I speak Malay with someone new, almost all the time I get this question, ""Amoi dari S***E***rawak eh?"". i remember my first deep connection with malays was during PLKN time, and the first month was pretty tough due to their accent &bahasa pasar (then i appreciate how proper speaking the smk cikgus are)

damn, i miss plkn. Saya rasa kebanyakan kita(bukan Melayu) dapat menulis dan membaca dalam Bahasa Melayu, terutamanya mereka yang pergi ke sekolah menengah kebangsaan, kalau tak, tak perlu dapat sijil SPM dah. 

Permasalahnnya merupakan, kita tak dapat bercakap secara fasih kerana kebanyakan kita jaring menggunakan Bahasa Melayu dalam pergaulan seharian, terutamanya mereka yang tinggal di kawasan bandar. Biasanya kita menggunakan Bahasa Inggeris berbanding dengan Bahasa Melayu.. My grandparents all cannot speak much. Cuz they only got until PMR at best. But I would say the generation that‚Äôs gone to school before, can sort themselves out but not to that very fluent level. > Some Malays are saying they are baffled that some Malaysians are still not fluent in BM despite having lived in Malaysia for many years or even for a lifetime. 

it's mostly just circlejerk. 

I think non-Malays would always be at a disadvantage, because we don't use BM as our first language at home. What do they expect? That we are able to debate socratic diabetic in BM? Like what u/dahteabagger, scoring BM exam is one thing, being fluent in everyday Malay is another. if you remove those Asrama leaks, and put Chinese and Malays at an equal playing field, i wanna bet my left nut Chinese will destroy Malays at their own game in BM exam overall. 

I think the bigger issue is: why do we have BM/BI curriculum whereby upon graduation students still cannot speak fluently... blame the game not the player. But seems like these lot always blame the player, just like what the politicians intended. They are kinda woke, but not woke enough imo.

personally think Mandarin and English is the future. Not a baseless opinion. At the end of the day, i would rather be cacat in BM, fluent in english and mandarin. At least i'm trilingual. As far as merits concerned, i do have the upper hand.. All my ex- bosses (all non Malay) but are in their 50s-60s are more fluent in Malay than me. And they speak and write the Bahasa Melayu baku/rasmi. I love listening to them when they converse.. The older non-Malays from interiors can't speak Malay well. This goes same to the highly educated non-Malays, their Malay is badly broken. Like myself I can speak Malay well. **Kalau tak boleh cakap bahasa melayu, macam tak Malaysia**. Broken Malay or not, i salute those who at least try to speak Malay. But lets make it clear, language must not be the barrier to learning and be united as Malaysians.. > Some Malays are saying they are baffled that some Malaysians are still not fluent in BM despite having lived in Malaysia for many years or even for a lifetime. 

Weird, usually Malays are MORE BAFFLED by the fact that I can speak fluent BM.

If they say the above quoted text, pretty sure he / she is a lesis.. Was kinda fluent when I graduated from high school. I'm not so fluent now that I seldom use it beyond dealing with Malay traders and the government.. Exactly. Learnt Malay is so different from spoken Malay. I had to relearn so much slang and colloquialisms from friends. 

It‚Äôs not our fault the education system doesn‚Äôt equip us for day to day speaking.. bahasa wicet is the worse...totally cannot understand. I can‚Äôt understand BM texts either most of the time. It takes actual effort to try to decode the message lol. Sometimes need a friend to help.. Hi there. I‚Äôm happy to hear, you seem like an ideal Malaysian. Fyi I‚Äôm not painting anyone anything here.  I‚Äôm Malay from one of the East Coast states where Chinese, Indians and others speak extremely fluent Malay, I speak fluent conversational Mandarin (bcs went to a Chinese school for almost a decade & spent my childhood with Chinese friends, now tend to be drawn to Chinese at work, where I also speak Mandarin). I‚Äôm just intrigued and want to put myself in non-Malays shoes to know how true this is from your perspectives. Apologies if this post hurts anyone‚Äôs feeling.. > i wanna bet my left nut Chinese will destroy Malays at their own game in BM exam overall 

Can the Chinese not destroy the Malays in BM exam?

Coz...

""ini tanah MELAYUUUUUUU!!!!!1!!11!!!"". World is progressing. Technology advancement are mainly made by the west and far east. So it is only natural that Kadazan, Iban, Malay language remain for local communication and not track with 5G terms. 

To make things worse, there are youth bragging about SPM exam results scoring 7G total failure. As social media ask, how can a Malay fail Malay language? So the imposition of Malay language on other ethnicity is a racist agenda. 

Imagine the next 2 or 3 generation, bn will impose that all who fail BM, they will revoke their voting rights, meaning, lost of citizenship and their wealth will be confiscated by government enriching the evil elites. 

If that does not work, maybe they will try to impose Kelantan dialect test and if minority fail, they can seize people's wealth.. What people need to learn is conversational Malay and the key in doing that is to assimilate from early childhood. You don't need to learn, just hang out with some Malay friends once in awhile and you'll get the basics. Even English people don't speak grammatically perfect English in the UK and with the rise in Rap culture it is becoming worse but the point is that you understand your peers.. There were a few redditors that argued that English has a similar situation. I don't think so at all - you learn formal English, you can still understand everyday conversations - you learn formal Malay, you'd get confused by everyday conversations.. Wicet is literally the same thing as pasar Malay but with (intentional??) Misspellings. Well that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. School doesn‚Äôt teach colloquialisms. Only formal and very stiff bahasa baku.

I only learnt to speak the way I do because I mixed around with Malay friends. Even hanging out with them is learning from them, albeit indirectly. I learnt to emulate accents and slang that‚Äôs how I picked it up.. Yeah it‚Äôs weird. There‚Äôs a strong disconnect somehow. English does have its own slangs and accents but learnt and spoken aren‚Äôt too different. 

Could be the influence of media too. Most of the media I consume is English, which would account for it being my strongest language. Tbh though, not much Malay or Chinese media interests me. At most I‚Äôll listen to the news in Malay.. Yeah that's why vernacular schools should just go. My SK, SMK chinese friends are somewhat okay in Malay in that you can have full serious conversations with them. We need to hang out with each other more. As far as i see the really neutral grounds in this country (Peninsular) are the mamaks. Where's our Mamak minister? or maybe we can learn more from our Eastern brothers and sisters.. My theory is that while Dewan Bahasa has successfully pushed for the formal usage throughout formal use, they're too syiok sendiri when making things up and lost the organic aspect of how languages are used or evolved. Nobody uses swafoto or tunafoto.. I agree. I‚Äôm from an SK & SMK school too. Vernacular & Tahfiz schools too (while we‚Äôre at it) are antithetical to a multicultural society. These schools have made people so insular and unaccepting towards others not in their own group.  

You want to learn your mother tongue? That‚Äôs fine, there needs to be a subject in the curriculum for it.

I agree with you though. We need to talk to each other. Honestly all of us aren‚Äôt so different. We like similar foods, we have similar interests and we still rather be Malaysian at the end of the day. Language is the real barrier to us.. That‚Äôs not true at all. The Malays, Chinese and Ibans study in vernacular schools in Sarawak and all of them can communicate in Mandarin, Malay or English depending on their choice. Only in Semenanjung where people segregate themselves.. If you want to learn more from your Eastern brothers and sisters, first thing is you need to shut the fuck up about abolishing vernacular schools. SK and SMK here are not as good as vernacular schools and independent schools. Ain't gonna send my children to those shitty schools, unity or not.

Also, I am from eastern Malaysia myself and here we are all okay with communicating with each other either in English or BM.. TIL. Also nobody cares lmao. Everyone just says selfie anyway. I just learned viral is tular. But everyone just uses VIRAL CHEESE MELELEH anyway.",1918.0,9,91,0

25,My Experience of Mixed Race Dating,dl00xr,2019-10-21 12:46:31,"I know this is a controversial topic, but I would like to share my story and hopefully help others in this situation. For a period of time, I lived overseas and have had a partner who was Muslim. 

A bit of background: her family moved to Australia when she was about 9 and she pretty much is westernised. She does have a strict family and growing up is hard for her. Her parents were against me being with her. Well, it was really a racial problem really, needless to be said. I was working at a restaurant back then and her mum actually called into the work phone to tell me to back off from her daughter. 

We were a good team though during our year and a half of being together. We fought through everything that came at us. She worked at the airport a few months into our relationship and I eventually worked a geologist. 

She was planning to move to Melbourne to further her master studies. It will be her first time moving away from home and she is very excited to be havinf this much of freedom. And leading up to that move, we sort of knew it was coming but we never really had the talk. 

We were both deeply in love with each other. But on the other hand, deep down, I knew our parents will not accept us and it will be an even harder road ahead. I kept asking myself if this is the life I want to choose for myself, and for the people who we grew up with. In the beginning of our relationship, I just really liked her and wanted to see where this goes, but the longer we were together, the harder it was to let go. She was a really lovely person, and as a Chinese, I find that Malays are generally more affectionate. Your mileage may vary. 

So in a way, the whole time when we were together, I had half my foot out of the door already, so to speak. And I did not really think and realise it. When she moved she just give up on us. Surprisingly I wanted us to do long distance and keep trying. To me, at least we tried. But she didn't want to. It wasn't a good ending we had (she found someone new 2 weeks after we broke up and she posted a snap of them in bed on Valentine's day. Broke my heart.) 

I'll skip past the drama etc. About 8 months later, we recently reconnected. And she told me that she still had feelings for me. I fell into depression when we broke up and I still feel that a part of me is still recovering from having my heart broken that much. We spoke and tried to recreate what we had. But it was too late I feel, and instead of having those problems before, we had newer ones on top of all that.

So it became apparent that we weren't going anywhere. And I broke things off this time. I realised that her religion and many other things (like her constant drinking and partying, and social media) were not instilling confidence. She wanted me to convert (without even asking if I'm okay with it when she knows that I'm not religious), and she mentioned that if we were to ever have kids, she wants to raise them as Muslims (in Australia). I'm fine with discussions because it helps with understanding. But the way she said it, it was like an ultimatum. 

Bottomline, the reason why I shared this story is, that if you are getting together with someone of a different race and you aren't very sure even after a few months in, you should reconsider. I am an advocate of mixed marriages, otherwise why would I even be with her in the first place. But if you are always doubting the future you're building together, then it will just be a waste of time for both parties. If you're unsure on dating someone who's racially different too: it's totally okay to be doing so. It's just that you both have to talk it out maturely and have at least a clear plan on how to overcome racially related obstacles. 

I thought I would share this out if it will help you going through a hard time. I certainly hope it will help. Do share with me your stories if you have any!",42,0.79,46.0,"I just felt like you dodge a bullet.. She sounds like a hypocrite. A Muslim who drinks and parties but forces her significant other to convert and follow the Muslim teaching? You dodge a bullet mate.. Hard to have a future with a woman who is wishy washy with her principles. You can't have your cake and eat it, just choose one. 

Think you saved yourself some headache down the line. As a child of a mixed marriage where one had to convert, DO NOT EVER convert just cause you wanna get married. It is a set of life principles, not a license to halal fuck. Only convert if it's your own sincere choice, otherwise you'll fuck up your family's life in more ways than one down the line. never date a muslim who wants you to convert, especially if you're in a country where the law doesn't require you to convert to get married.. From reading your story it seems to me that race and religion were only sideshows for the real problems in your relationship.

She started a new relationship publicly 2 weeks after you broke up. You had the option of continuing things in Australia if you wanted to get past the religion thing. She didn't consider it because she was a hypocrite who expected you to convert despite being 'western'. She comes back months later then tells you she still has feelings after giving you so much shit.

Your relationship fell apart because she was an asshole to you, not because of her race or religion.

It's like the others here are saying, you dodged a bullet. There are much better people out there for you.. Ah, love Muslims in the west that do this bullshit. Fuck around, drink alcohol but oh no babi is HARAM! Theyre also the ones being triggered as fuck when you say something against Islam and supporting gay people while at the same time fucking around with white chicks like your average kafir.

You should be grateful that your relationship is over with such a hypocritical woman. I'm an ex Muslim and I know a lot of this kinda ""Muslim"" woman in the west.. Mixed-race marriages are fine, but not when religion is involved. Especially in Malaysia where there is only in and almost no way out for Islam, majority of us would throw out any romantic ideas. Unless of course the significant other is willing to migrate to a true secular country and practice freedom of religion. I think she had an inherent personality issue; a westernised Asian wouldn't have put such pressure on you in such a backwards way. But that's just my two cents! I also have a story to share!

I am a Sarawakian bumiputera, a tribal girl. I'm dating a non-Malaysian. I went to a British international university in Selangor for foundation and met him here.

We've been together for almost 2 years! Our anniversary is coming up next week. It's been tough culturally; romantically, however I think we're solid in working through problems.

Meeting his family was an odd experience, there was a large difference between our cultures. I, myself was a 3rd culture kid, being bumiputera raised in a Chinese school and later having gone to international university. I didn't even feel like I belonged in my ethnicity because I was too 'Chinese'. 

My boyfriend's family settled in Malaysia a long time ago. He understands the general Malaysian quirks and ""-lah"", Malaysian food, some basic political/viral memes, but that's about it.

We would always find our respective cultures very weird. Like Malaysian pantang larang, or the Malaysian habit of calling parents aunty and uncle (I'm not allowed to call my in laws that!)

Sidenote: If there's anything I learned about Malaysians though, there's a lot of White Man Worship around that really irritates me. (Pick up a history book, man!)

Anyway, I'm very lucky however, we're both Catholics and there are no problems with religion or marriage. 

There are also a lot of socio-economic differences that makes me somewhat insecure sometimes (me, a budak Sarawak with his mat salleh-ness), but his family has been very accomodating.

The only annoying side effect is getting a lot of rude Malaysians staring at us (me, holding hands/PDA-ing with orang putih)... but I try not read into it!. Sounds like a case of  'spirituality unites, religion divides'. Enjoy to rocks.. Sounds exactly like what I went thru b4.. Glad I dodged that bullet. The similarities are uncanny actually, after 1st seperation, in 2 wks FB post ""in a relationship"".. It seems like race isn't the issue here, more like religion. Made weird considering said girl is pretty westernized - at least from what I read from your post.

Great that you eventually left that ~~bit~~ woman. No more having to deal with potential issues trying to raise your kids as Muslims in a secular country like Australia where the issue of forced conversion doesn't even exists.. Thanks for sharing, also /r/ExNoContact. Thanks for sharing OP. 
Sorry timo hear your x partner did not even consider or entertain the option of trying to marry outside to not have to force you.

Much love.. Hi bro! I hope you will meet someone much better in the future.. >2 weeks after we broke up

bruh, she had that new pelampung wayyyy before you two broke up. Chances are the new guy she found after those two weeks cannot comply with her so called ultimatum, therefore come back try it out with you la.

And, she drinks? Is that legal in the name of her religion? Not judging, it's just a question coz I don't know.. It sounds like you are conflating race with religion here, the root cause of your struggles is Islam and not because she is of a different race.. Hopefully you got one last fuck before dumping her.. Agreed.. There were many things that I left out. Like her wanting attention all the time etc. More of a maturity thing maybe. But I don't know, my brain knows that she's not the one, but my heart feels differently.. I didn't need to go that far down to know he dodged a bullet. I mean, bros, she moved on within 2 weeks after breaking up with him while OP sounds like he never moved on. They say that the period it takes to move on from a freshly ended relationship is equivalent to how long a couple were together. If she moved on that fast after spending so long together, that's a major red flag.. Oh yes the irony. Thanks mate. I wish I will see that one day.. Thanks for your reply. 

There was a lot of problems with what we had, but I think I outlined the most glaring ones. She was also very social media ish and thinks about being sexy etc. Basically she wants attention. 

Thank you for the advice and perspective given.. Truth.. So.. she is like the sjw in twitter that think her opinion is the one that matters ? If so, op really dodge a sniper bullet here.. Bro same here. I‚Äôm an ex Muslim here in the states and holy crap the hypocrisy is unreal. From my own family to the actual Malay community, it‚Äôs everywhere yet I get shit on just cause I don‚Äôt participate in the religious activities anymore.. Congratulations, you made it out of the 'closet' ...alive :D LOL. Funny story, she doesn't eat pork because she said she's been trained since young to not do so. But when it comes to ramen, she can take them because 'ramen is something else'. But it's also quite contradictory because if she's been trained since young to not eat pork, wouldn't she also not drink alcohol? 

I don't know, that is just my logic speaking. I apologise if I offended you.. I‚Äôm a Muslim, but I feel you. Everyone is all warm and welcoming until religion comes in. They get all unfriendly and defensive and rigid and forceful that you even scared to ask them questions. I ask my brother once about writing a metaphor as a reference to the Quran and he went from laid back to forceful in a matter of seconds. I ask my mom about abortion and she gets mad, saying it was a sin but never answer my question until I tell her that it was just a question.. Yo, not just in the west. I‚Äôm a happily married man now, but in my Tinder days, I would nonstop get Muslim girls wanting to hook up with me. It was all about me being white.. This is standard with any and all religions.. Islam is problematic here. That Muslims are not allowed to change their religion.. Thanks mate. I hope so too. Right now I'm just doubting myself and going through all the sadness again. But I know I'll be alright.. Cheers. Appreciate the kind words. I hope things will be better from here.. Girl needs to work harder for Mat Sallehs to convert lol. In Malaysia, being a Malay is synonymous with being a Muslim. In my case here, I do agree it's a problem of her religion. But I did add on at the end of my comment that being in a mixed race relationship is fine (and added on from there). Dude, that's low even for a scumbag like me.. Agreeed.. Funny... She's a heavy user of Twitter. White worshipping is a terrible thing across Asia.. But she was not in Malaysia.

Did you know that there are many Singaporean Malays who changed religion ?

Anyway it seems you dodge a bullet like many others had said because it's mainly due to her behaviour and upbringing, not due to race.. Oh Nat.. With a flair like 'Anti SJW', what do you expect? (I think the extreme ones are bad, of course, but this dude totally went full retard.). I‚Äôm not sure it is ‚Äúterrible‚Äù as much as it is ridiculous.

I don't approve, but I understand.. Poor mak cik. I read that the mother doesn‚Äôt even live with her daughter? So it‚Äôs not like she doesn‚Äôt have any privacy or can‚Äôt have a life cause her mother is right there.

The mak cik also looks alive and healthy Alhamdulillah, so its not like the daughter has to literally carry her around or whatever. 

Terrible daughter.. What kind of monster would do this to their own mother? One day when she's old and frail, don't be surprised if her own children abandon her to die.. Damn, how someone can be so heartless to their own mum is beyond me.. Please don‚Äôt judge both the mother and daughter  too quickly. The article is written poorly IMO.

As other redditors mentioned, they don‚Äôt live together. There‚Äôs also unclear if there were others taking care of her before ie siblings or relations prior to this.

Older people can sometimes be a pain. Where taking care of them physically and financially may be taxing, other issues around social and emotional issues may affect the mental health and family ties.

[The same report that also stated that Malay Mail was seeking clarification from me as why the case was ordered to be dismissed is untrue aswell]( Malaysian media needs to buck up, they cannot keep on doing big fuck up like this. Malay Mail for not doing enough due diligence, other media for simply lap it up and do not verify the news first.. Can someone provide a summary of what what has developed? I thought this was supposed to be an open and shut case last time. How many of us here have similar story before the age of viral this viral that? Maybe around 1990-2010. 

Let me start with mine, back when I was in MRSM Pasir Tumboh, (2000-2003) there was a case where an ‚Äúustaz‚Äù, we called him Ustaz Halim he love to paddle the story of how the hostel are haunted, the campus need to be gated from evil spirit and shit, he‚Äôll get close to multiple students especially the handsome one, he‚Äôll fondle them inappropriately. After a few months of misbehaviour, this group of victims got tired of the abuse and reported to the principal and what she have done? Sacked him and barred from entering school campus, no police report lodged, case closed. The nerve of the principal to let pedophile running loose in the wild. 

Of course we‚Äôre too naive back then, we dont know what is pedophile and how to specifically deal with this kind of situation. Hope this man die of cancer.. Now I dunno who to point pitch forks at, my beloved news outlet or an AG from the new government. Buttonsweatmeme.jpg. the one suspicious thing is that he says the malay mail never contacted him or his office for clarification. That's a very basic thing for a journalist to do before publishing a story, so either the malay mail journalist or the AG is outright lying about this.. *an out of nowhere in a seemingly unnatural turn of events, malay mail actually competent enough to ask the court to provide a copy of those letter*

imagine if this happen lmao. So looks like it's defamation suit time for Malay mail. August 7: [According to the lawyer representing the victim, which MalayMail relied on for their reporting](, the court recognized that an offence took place.
> The family‚Äôs lawyer, Asiah Abd Jalil, told reporters when met after the court proceedings, which took place in private chambers, that the Magistrate Mohammad Afifi Mohammad Deen recognised that an offence did take place following the complaint made by the victim‚Äôs mother.
> ‚ÄúThe court today listened to the complaint made by the mother, the case chronology and also took note of why the investigation paper on the case was not completed.
> ‚ÄúAfter going through the case, the magistrate takes cognisance of the offence involved in the case,‚Äù she said after the court proceedings, which lasted about an hour.

October 14: [According to the MalayMail](
> Magistrate Mohammad Afifi Mohammad Deen made the decision after the court was provided with a letter from the Perak State Legal Adviser‚Äôs Office detailing a directive by Attorney General (AG) Tan Sri Tommy Thomas written under Article 145(3) of the Federal Constitution.

October 21: AGC clarifies situation as per OP's post.

Based on the above, it would seem the family's lawyer gave a misleading statement which started this entire kerfuffle, unless MalayMail misreported her statements on August 7.

This shenanigan goes to show how much the public shouldn't be raising pitchforks prematurely unless and until official statements from both parties are issued; do that after.

Edit: based on the AGC's clarification, the case is still classified as No Further Action (NFA) due to lack of evidences for further investigation. The standard of proof for a criminal offence is to prove beyond reasonable doubt. As such, unless and until they have all the evidences necessary to show that the offence was committed beyond reasonable doubt, the case will stay classified as NFA.

Criminal lawyers can correct me on this hastened analysis.. TLDR:

1. Sep 2016: Not enough evidence. DPP assigned ""No Further Action"" (NFA)
2. Feb 2017: More evidence, DPP again assigned NFA cause still insufficient.
3. June 2019: Letter of complaint sent to magistrate. Magistrate took up the complaint.
4. Fake News: AG said he didn't instruct the magistrate to dismiss the case, as reported by news portal. In any case, Magistrate should'nt have taken up the complaint due to SOP.
5. Reiterate the role of AG in Malaysia as per Art 145(3)- The DPP acted on behalf of the AG (PP)

Note: In Malaysia, AG is the PP (Public Prosecutor). DPP stands for Deputy Public Prosecutor, and not Director of Public Prosecutions. As such you will see AG referring to different DPPs.. wrong. 

OBLIGATORY: SEMUA SALAH BANGSA DAP LGE.. just feel like it's too subjective. The whole summary is basically AG reiterating as what he can do as a PP as per the consitution and how the DPPs acted on his behalf.

> he standard of proof for a criminal offence is to prove beyond reasonable doubt

Would this apply even before the trial, somemore by agents of the executive? Wouldn't it be up to the court to decide what is admissable and what isn't?. Your question is premised on two distinct legal concepts: admissibility of evidence and the standard of proof. 

The Court must apply the Evidence Act to decide what is admissible and what is not.

There are two standards of proof: for civil cases, it's generally ""on the balance of probabilities"" while for criminal cases, it's always ""beyond reasonable doubt"". 

While I'm no criminal lawyer, I am certain that the prosecution must be well prepared before charging the defendant. Otherwise, the defendant would get away by arguing a technical/procedural defence. I believe the MARA theft scenario was won by the defendant using this method.

Edit: tried linking up the MARA theft case but gave up halfway because I walked into a pole. Enjoy this useless edit.

Edit2: in short, both prosecution and defendant would posit their arguments based on the standard of proof to the court. The court, having reviewed the evidences and arguments, would then deliver their findings based on the standard of proof.",1035.0,15,1,0
30,Is circumcision promoted among Malaysian boys?,dkytu7,2019-10-21 10:59:19,notexthere,13,0.75,25.0,"you mean among non muslims? afaik 100% of muslim boys are circumcised. Orang cina kat sini, not a muslim. My circumcision was done for a hygienic reason and not for a religious purpose. I got mine done in a small clinic operated by local chinese doctors when I was 11 or 12. The doctor said my foreskin is too long (can't see the ""head"" or ""tip"" even if you pull all the skin back), and it's unhygienic since some pee stains will remain within the foreskin due to how long it is, and years of accumulated germs inside that place can't be good. 

I was told that I was supposed to be circumcised when I was still a baby, since the doctor could tell my foreskin was already abnormally long even back then. My parents chose to wait because the doctor told them it might be a little risky to do circumcision on babies. (Blood loss might not heal that well on babies and doctors might remove more than enough since it's hard to estimate exactly how much foreskin should be removed due to babies having tiny penises)

So I grew up normally till I was 11 or 12 without knowing about all these, then suddenly one day my parents explained to me about how I kena prepare for a circumcision. (Everything suddenly makes sense, because I have always notice how my dad's penis is way different than mine aside from the bulu and size when I was still a kid, I can't see the ""head"" of my penis but I can see the ""head"" very clearly on my father punya that thing)

I don't know if kids have a lower endurance to pain because from what I remember it hurts like hell, and I can't stop crying during the entire process. And of course I could still remember wearing a sarung after the operation. Wearing pants hurts after circumcision, plus you probably don't want blood stains on your pants.


If it is not for a religious reason like me, you should seek advises from different doctors first before deciding if you really need to undergo a circumcision operation. I remember someone saying the key factor is whether you could see your ""head"" down there clearly when you pulled the foreskin back, or when you are fully erected.. Not promoted. For those who are muslim I believe it's mandatory to be circumcised. For those who are non-muslim it's the parents/guardians decision. I know 2 of my non-muslim friends who did get a circumcision. Never met any muslim who hasn't gotten one though.. Nope. Many chinese use circumcision as joke among themselves. at least in my group.

""Ehhhh that awek damn pretty leh!""

""But you need potong kuku wo?!""

*group laugh + elbow push

Most topic regarding sex and sexual organs are taboo, especially for past generation. I would venture a guess of 90% of us learn about human bodies through porn first.. A good friend of mine who is Malaysian Chinese actually wanted to get circumcised due to hygeine. He couldn't get it done though, parents were against it.. I'm a doctor conducting clinical study on male circumcision as a favourable and traditional practise among Southeast Asian boys particularly those of Chinese ethnicity.. Not really, I only took it because I considered it a right of passage, no one promoted it back home. If you're a Muslim boy then yes you have to. But I'm not Muslim. I didn't have a circumcision and it's not promoted.. Are you saying it's more a religious than cultural practice in Malaysia?. >notice my dad's penis is way different than mine

This reminded me of a 4chan greentext I saw once.. You get to see your dad's dick? Lucky you. It's not really the stain that refrained me from wearing a pants, it's the case of dry blood sticking to both of your pant and head.. Any chance your friends are Malaysian Chinese?. How old is he? If he's old enough, he can just get it done, and it's not like they'll know better.. If he's an adult he should just go for it. It's not like his parents are gonna know about it. Malaysian Chinese here, did circumcision due to hygienic reason when I was a small kid. Btw, my father did his as well.. May I know if your ethnicity is Malaysian Chinese?. Its religious, but I know a macha friend who has his dick already cut when I was in kindergarten.. nope. not promoted. I see no reason to mutilate boys for no reason...thats my pov. very much so.  that's how it is in most of the world.. Show us. Oh wow I forgot about my Chinese friend as well. So yeah, its 3 now. The other 2 are Indian.. Why? Is this your homework?. .....OP

you need to do more research. circumcision are done for religious and non-religious reasons regardless of nationality, race or religion...
If you look into it deep, you'll get it. 

We (monyets) don't know what's your end game here. So please explain further of what's your premise is.. I see. So it's safe for me to conclude you're a non Muslim since you don't believe in it?. There are Non Muslims who believe in circumcision as well.. why do you ask?",876.0,6,1,0

u/Excurryba. Oh I see, that makes more sense.. Or, drive safely and don't tailgate people? There is no excuse for it.

Assholes do it even when the car is overtaking someone and already speeding.

Malaysia has one of the highest road death rates in the world, and your comment clearly highlights the mindset that causes it.

The saying ""First world technology, third world mindset"" rings true with you.. If you are driving above the limit, that's illegal and you're raising the risk of accidents in general, especially if everyone does what you do. I know there were a few studies centered around the autobahn that said otherwise, but the rest of the data in general 
 just shows what drewkk was concerned about, higher speeds = more accidents.. It's idiots who don't want to move out of the way of another idiot that's driving at 180 that's the cause of accidents. ""Drive safe"" when you're also driving at 180 and the cause of accidents is tailgating lmao

100% of people who moved out of the way for people who were driving faster than them no matter how fast they already are did not get into an accident. 

There is absolutely no reason one would continue to tailgate you if you weren't road hogging.. We were talking about tailgating. Of course speeding is dangerous, but like save yourself and remove yourself from their path, ya know? Is that so wrong for me to say? To give way? Why would anyone insist on putting themselves right smack in the mid of it?

I don't get it. Why is it so difficult for people to just *give way* whenever you can? It's as much your safety than anything right? Am I being unreasonable here? People will speed. That's just how idiots are. But aren't you equally idiotic if you refuse to move is my point here.

I can't brain how people want to argue other people speeding with the right to lane hog. Both are equally selfish IMO.

It's not about who's right or who's wrong. It's about if you don't like to be tailgated, just move aside. If you cold, use the blanket. Not argue about which is more right whether aircond should turn down or just use the blanket; that's besides the point. You are cold now, use whatever is most available to you. 

I'm not getting through so I'mma let this matter rest. And you should too bro, don't you have work tmr?. Desktop link:

Makes sense. Keep that third world mindset going.

People tailgate in Malaysia in large groups, you often see 5+ cars tailgating each other speeding down the highway. People even tailgate in heavy traffic.

Stop making excuses for asshole that are killing thousands of people each year.

Lets not even start with kids just running free around the car.. That's the same saying the rapists will be rapists and girls should all not wear however they want. Literally missing the problem here hello we want to curb bad behaviours, not completely avoiding them and letting them loose.. Let me ask you this...

Why is it so hard to selfish people to just drive safely?  
Their 3 seconds of time more important than someones life?

Again, absolutely no one is defending people driving in the right hand lane incorrectly. No one. Not a single person.

It is not about who likes or does not like being tailgated. It is about tailgating being incredibly dangerous, it is about Malaysia having one of the highest road fatality rates in the ***world,*** it is about idiots like you how ""cant brain"" it that it is dangerous.. Says the road hogger who doesn't know what a passing lane is lmao

Usually it's just people driving 110 but you can exaggerate all you want. If someone is driving 180 it's most probably an almost empty road and if for some reason driving in the middle lane at 90 as opposed to the passing lane hurts your delicate feelings guess what buddy it's you.

You are probably the type that thinks like anything less than 2 seconds away even in heavy traffic is tailgate. Where do you frequent? I mean, ya know, I drive home all the time üôÑ I don't see large groups tailgating (assuming we have the same def of what tailgating actually is).. So I'm more than happy to pull over if someone wants to pass. 

But to support your point, you're quite correct - it's pretty well proven (albeit from studies in other countries) that speeding in urban or even highway environments only shortens journey times by a few minutes for anything less than a one hour trip. What really shortens trips of about an hour or less in urban environments is choice of route (and most importantly), *traffic flow*. 

Reducing the number of light changes you have to sit through or more chokepoints where traffic does not move *at all* (either via luck, choice of route or timing of journey) will reduce journey time significantly compared to simply speeding.. Ahh bro, you've never tried driving North/South in Malaysia have you? Especially going to Penang or Johor from KL have you?

If you think no one goes over 110, you've lost your mind.

Nearer to Johor people tailgate even in the left lane. So many fuckers from Singapore coming over and opening it up the second they cross the border.. Yeah I have actually. There are people who race, but like no one is speaking for them la. I didn't say people don't drive over 110, I'm saying most of the time it's just give or take 20-40 above speed limit in usual traffic. 

It's a long distance drive, if you are driving at 90, please keep to the left lane. People want to reach Singapore/penang before the sun comes up and traffic starts to build up (at least for me I usually drive midnight).  If someone tailgate you at left lane, probably because someone hogging right lane and they trying to cut. Doesn't matter how dangerously other people drive, put yourself out of harm's way, and don't so ego and duwan move honestly. For what? Prove a point?. See, that is the problem. You talk so casually about driving 130-150km/h like it is no big deal.

You are the problem. People like you are the ones that kill thousands of Malaysians each year.

Penang to KL is not really a long drive, it's longer because everyone slows down to have a good look at the accidents on the side of the road caused by people speeding and tailgating... If people didn't drive so dangerously in Malaysia, the drive would actually be much faster.. Yeah just like irl I have no patience with lane hoggers here on reddit or on the road. I drive 95 also you won't move that's the problem isn't it? ü§î. Thats right, you have no patience.

No one is driving 95 in the right lane. People are overtaking driving at the speed limit or a little over and it's still not good enough for impatient people like you.

Your 3 seconds is more important that someones life is it? ü§î. I don't tailgate but people like you don't ever give way until ppl flash and cut you from the left. Either oblivious which is bad enough, or just an asshole. Only these two things. 


I could turn it around and say you needing your ego stroked by HAVING to hog the passing lane is more important than choosing to give way. See I could do that too. If you don't give way it's almost as if you're ASKING people to tailgate you. I mean like, it's not like I could give you a ring and ask if you would move aside for me right. What is the reason you won't give way? Because what? You are equally complicit for being an asshole for no reason. You can also drive the speed limit in the middle lane too you know. You went to passing lane because someone was slower than you right? You rather choose to die than move over? üôÑ If you care about the law so much then read that you're supposed to give way, and you're not supposed to stay on the passing lane.

Point is not the speed. It's about lane hoggers. Like I said. Even if I was driving just 5km/h faster you still wouldn't give way because that's just what road hoggers do.. People like me? I don't hog the right lane like you claim I do, it is merely an observation from the left hand lane. There is no ""middle"" lane for 99% of the highway to Penang.

But, you have admitted to driving dangerously because you're selfish.

Hope that when you do have a big accident that you don't kill or hurt anyone other than yourself.  
Keep your third world mindset going, thousands of Malaysians die needlessly each year because of selfish people like you.. Oh piss off, ppl die from speeds not tailgating. At worst it's a six car bumper to bumper. Get off your high horse, if a person can see a car fucking speeding uncontrollably towards them and they don't fucking move, that's Darwin at play. 

I don't tailgate but I still think lane hoggers are way more selfish than people who drive over speed limit. They aren't the one bothering you, you're the one that's bothering other people and also causing a jam.. Speeding a large contributing factor to fatalities, no one is arguing this point.

Not keeping a safe following distance (tailgating), is also a large cause of accidents. The person ramming the car from behind is the one at fault, stop trying to make excuses for them.

People with your mindset is the reason Malaysia will never be a developed country,. Yeah and you can continue dodging all about how they should be moving aside but they don't like it's so much to ask on a PASSING LANE, about what passing lane is, about how they don't even move no matter what speed it is, and how they don't give way until someone needs to signal them and they go all REEEEE and then say other people are being difficult üëçüèª

Good night darling.. ***L-I-T-E-R-A-L-L-Y*** no one is saying that they shouldn't move to the side. On the same side of the coin, that does not make tailgating or speeding any safer or any more acceptable.

You ever hear the saying that two wrongs don't make a right?

Again, impatient and selfish people like you are the reasons that thousands of Malaysians die each year.",2281.0,4,1,0

34,Malaysia Fears Becoming Sanctions Target in Trade War Crossfire,dkyj7u,2019-10-21 10:29:38,notexthere,16,0.95,4.0," By [Anisah Shukry](

* Rivalry could turn into another Cold War, Malaysian PM says
* U.S. placed Malaysia on FX manipulator watch list in May  


Malaysia may become a target of sanctions as the export-reliant economy is caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China trade war, according to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Mahathir said trade tensions between the world‚Äôs two biggest economies could evolve into another Cold war, although he didn‚Äôt specify who could impose the curbs.

‚ÄúEconomically we are linked to both markets, and physically we are also caught in between for geographical reasons,‚Äù Mahathir said in Kuala Lumpur. ‚ÄúThere are even suggestions that we ourselves would be a target for sanctions.‚Äù

He said Malaysia will prepare for the worst by cooperating with regional neighbors, but didn‚Äôt elaborate.

Neighboring Vietnam has already drawn the U.S. government‚Äôs ire, with President Donald Trump describing the Southeast Asian nation as ‚Äúalmost the single worst abuser of everybody‚Äù when asked if he wanted to impose tariffs on the nation. Malaysia was placed on the U.S. Treasury watch list for currency manipulation in May for its bilateral trade and current-account surplus. The central bank has denied the nation manipulates its currency and said it supports free and fair trade.. Dear Trump we Malaysian would be more than happy if 1MYR = 1USD...there is no fx manipulation...maybe. [](  


Mahathir warns of possible trade sanctions on Malaysia

One more kacang hijau, a block of carrot and jagung seriously ill murder the chef one day. I am proudly both. oi! kacang hijau on nasi goreng is nice okeh. Taugeh fucking sucks. At least nanas gives a sweet flavour which understandably will appeal to some people. Taugeh just tastes like wank. Will never understand why people like it. What's wrong with taugeh?. Abominable. Bluek!. It's edible you freakin piece of cheese!. Green chili in green vege fry.. Cheese + porridge. Kacang hijau? No way omg. Bawang hijau... Now you're talking.. i like tauge in my everything and i like pineapple in everything. my friends and i love tauge so much we named ourselves after them (not /s). Can somebody just gimme *scientific* reasons for disliking these combinations. I usually pick out the nenas first and eat it, then eat the pizza. Same case for taugeh in bihun..

Im glad Im not the only ones that hate those things.You think you are eating noodles peacefully then all of a sudden you feel something crispy and the crappy taugeh flavour leaks out and ruins everything Lmao they are literally imposter noodles..

""This is not PIZZA!!!"". my girlfriend, just found out recently... The whole world.. me.

ruins it imo.. Taugeh makes the beehun crunchy yo. Yeah, there is nothing wrong with it, not sure why OP brag about it.. Pardon the heathens from the peninsular.. or kuey teow. men....



me too. I like my nasi goreng without veggies that taste like plastic.. ?????. I like taugeh. It felt crunchy when eating them.. You talk shit about taugeh and you bout be smacked sideways XD But on a serious note, I can't do without it in bak kut teh!. Taugeh master race!. Pineapple overpowers pretty much every other flavour on the pizza instead of complimenting it.. ever had salted fish taugeh? the one with wok hei flavour. it depend on how the taugeh is cook, if the tauge is not cook properly (i.e: soggy), I just cant eat them.. Taugeh is good and crunchy in its own, as a sayur.  

But putting it in noodles is a big no-no for me.. Depends on how you make it. Taugeh can be tasty if remove the roots, stir fry it or blanch it with water and use shallot oil and soy sauce.. Add chocolate meleleh. How many derivatives of taugeh are there?. They are forged from weak seeds.. Some foods complement each other because of their taste profiles; there's actual chemical reasons for this based on culinary science research.  Sometimes, the match is borderline or one of the foods is divisive in and of itself.  

Pineapple on pizza (or, specifically, the tomato sauce and meat on the pizza) is one of these combinations.   It doesn't help that different sauce recipes and topping combinations can change the profile even more, pushing it over the line sometimes.  Hence, the fight over it being on pizza.

Taugeh is the same.  It's relatively bland with little flavour, and tends to add moisture to the bihun dish.  These features can sort of dilute the taste of the rest of the dish, making it seem more bland.  Again, as with pizza, the fact that recipes can vary a lot in terms of spiciness and flavour strength can push the overall taste over the line from ""Tastes good"" to ""Bleh"" territory.

In any case, I hate bihun anyway.  So, not my problem.. I only like taugeh if it's cooked and drenched in soy & sesame sauce.. also peninsualar monkeys:

""let's mix two types of noodles"". read the title. yes. crunchy sayur, what‚Äôs not to love. I mean yeah, it does give a crispy addition to the soft mee.

The act was believed to be targeted at the vice-chancellor who, the graduate alleged, had made racial remarks at the Kongres Maruah Melayu (Malay Dignity Congress) on Oct 6.*

You know what, I support his protest.

Not on grounds of freedom of speech, but because I believe Malay supremacism, especially among those in positions of power, must be kept in check and ultimately defeated (although I dunno if that's possible). As a Malay, I can have my maruah without disparaging other races.

Is it inconvenient to the parents, guests and other people there? Yeah. But I wager non-Bumis are also very inconvenienced by the state-enforced discrimination.. An openly racist Malay dignity congress: I sleep
Protesting a racist message at a convo: Biadap!

""Curse of being the majority"" at full display here.. A firestarter rearing its head again... You really are a fly, aren't you?. It wasn‚Äôt even two minutes of protest. Why are y‚Äôall so stressed about it?. would have to disagree with you. granted, there are better ways to protest. but there's always a better way to protest, if you don't want people to hear about it.. The convocation was not an event just for him. It was to celebrate all other graduates, attended by many VVIPs and parents of these graduates. 

If you want to protest against that VC, go ahead. But do it in your own event.. *the protest are meant to be rude so please see the message not the protest itself*

ha also got a tv interview now, pretty nice ah. Does everyone read the VC speech in the congress? Can anyone explain the specific bit that said about racial remark? I'm curious.

&#x200B;

 []( It‚Äôs okay to protest. But not in the convocation ceremony. Use ur brain meh. Rilek lah. He Chinese, orang melayu juga minta maaf on his behalf (UM). >Is it inconvenient to the parents, guests and other people there? Yeah. But I wager non-Bumis are also very inconvenienced by the state-enforced discrimination.

take my upvote. Dismantle the upper classes. The workers and the middle class must unite and have class solidarity. yea. i support his protest, against racism and anything related to that.  but not the location. idk. convocation event is the place where everyone in university celebrating. I believe everyone in there got no time for the drama. maybe just his tactic to get some new supporter for his new politic career in the future and its working.. Putting aside whether I agree with what he says or not, I don't support his protest.

I get that protests are supposed to be disruptive (hell, I basically oppose protests on general principle because of this), but there's a time and a place for it.  By doing his protest during the convocation, the focus doesn't fall on the matter he's protesting, but on him disrupting the ceremony.  He gives his opponents an excuse to dismiss him and his message by painting him as a mere troublemaker and stressing its impact on the ceremony itself.   Basically, he shot himself and his cause in the foot.

Had he chosen a different time to carry out his protest, one that wouldn't give his opponents so much free ammunition to shoot him with, we would be focusing on what he was saying instead of being distracted by how he said it.

**tl;dr:** How you say something is just as important as what you say.. It was a speech for an event called Kongres Maruah Melayu. VC opened with facts about Malay's depressing achievements in politic and economy. Throw out the rhetorical question ""Aren't political power supposed to be ours? (Malay)"". is the only thing I can see ppl get upset about, but it's a Malay event, shouldn't u rouse Malay pride slogan or w/e? He said something about three clusters of people are going to discuss how to improve Malay's achievement. A sound solution to the problem based on facts he laid out earlier. He doesn't say where the citation from though.

Now let's look at the student's Placard""Why VC must resign:

1. Being a Political Puppet - need citation
2. Infringing Academic Freedom - need a citation
3. Promoting racism & hatred - if softcore rousing speech for Malay to improve their achievements in promoting racism & hatred? sure. I don't hear anything that enables being prejudice against non-Bumi, nor an implication of it.
4. failing to protect a student's constitutional rights. -  I agree with this one, it's a violation of freedom of speech and expression. For example last time a UITM student was sent a 'love letter' for their involvement with BERSIH. However, this is a Malaysia-wide problem, not the VC alone.
5. Failing to solve UM's financial crisis. - need citation.

I have no love for the VC nor UM, but I despise this current protest meme.. Read the bloody transcript. Great example on how easy it is to make gullible person into a NPC by fake news. Because this Chinese fuck didn‚Äôt know his place. /s

Even though as student activist he tried all the regular avenues, submitting formal complaints, trying to seek a dialogue with the VC; all fell on deaf ears. So he did what he had to do and make a public statement.. Yeah, should just organize a non-malays dignity congress amirite? Pretty sure the nons are looking forward to a racial riot.

Edit: by the way, that suggested Congress would be as silly as earlier one.. If he did it at his own event, then nobody would have been aware of his concerns and UM can continue sweeping the dirt under the carpet. From what I heard, he already tried all the usual avenues to voice out, but was ignored by UM. So he did this. The whole point of a protest is to be disruptive to raise awareness to a problem and rally people into action to address it, and that's exactly what he has achieved.. Convocations are essentially private events, despite their communal nature. This protest is like doing it at a wedding.. Yep... The event wasn't even for the VC.

It's like protesting azmin on his sodomy, at the dignity conference.

So irrelevant.. Have my vote sir!. That dude probably left his brain in fridge. Also read somewhere that LKS ask UM to pull back the report.. Any protest that's effective would be labeled as rude by the entity (and it's supporters) it's targeting. So either don't protest or make a lame one?. Class struggle had always been, is, and will always be the real struggle.. But they will call you a commie. :D LOL. > I believe everyone in there got no time for the drama

I don't think Malay supremacism is ""drama"".

If he's protesting RuPaul-style and the cause is, I dunno, revamping the dress code to include winter colours, then yeah sure that's ""drama"".. > He gives his opponents an excuse to dismiss him and his message by painting him as a mere troublemaker

They will paint him as this **anyway**. Malay supremacists aren't interested in rational debate; if they are, they wouldn't be one.

Look at America and Copernick; dude's just peacefully kneeling and conservatives still paint him as a radical, disruptive leftist. 

When people say ""don't be disruptive with your protests"", what I'm hearing is ""make sure you keep your protests out of my sight"".

**tl;dr**: I will never expect the oppressed to politely say ""excuse me sir, can you *please* get this boot off my neck?"". Just as a matter of argument, you say that protests are meant to be disruptive. By definition, wouldn‚Äòt that mean that in general, there really is no appropriate time and place for it?

Not questioning your opinion on the matter, just wondering about the principle of it since I‚Äôve been seeing everyone talking about protests needing an appropriate ‚Äútime and place‚Äù. I only say this because one can argue that Bersih protests were pretty disruptive but we saw that as necessary to express dissatisfaction against authority.

I will agree that his credibility has been slashed for doing when he did it, and that the message has been diluted.. > but it's a Malay event, shouldn't u rouse Malay pride slogan or w/e?

No.

A German pride event shouldn't talk about the need for Lebensraum. A Chinese pride event shouldn't talk about Tianxia as a political objective.

In the context of Malaysian politics, the whole Malay pride event in itself is racist. We are at the apex of political power, apa lagi Melayu mau? Even if the VC is the most egalitarian of leftists, the fact that he participated in the event tainted his moral standing.. Ok here is my response to someo e asking the same question :


>Pemikiran rasis tak semestinya perlu dizahirkan terhadap mana2 kaum, cukup kalau memegang pemikiran bahawa kaum sendiri (atau kaum lain in the case of internalized racism) lebih tinggi darjatnya dari yang lain atas dasar kaum sahaja.

>Contoh: white power, white supremacy. Dua istilah ini umum diterima berbaur racism. Mengapa tidak ketuanan melayu? Orang lain kat sini dah petik apa yang VC to kata.

>E: i dont agree with what the um student did

You should read the um law society's statement on this matter. I posted this link to you in another thread but it seems you didn't read it so here I'm posting it for you again so you can read it:  

Some of my replies AFTER reading the bloody transcript here.. Don't have to read the entire transcript, look at point number four which says ""Malangnya, peralihan ini disulami perpecahan politik Melayu, sehingga menghilangkan dominasi politik Melayu"". 2020 is around the corner, the vice-chancellor is still in 1970s mentality.  Also, he said ""Bukankah kuasa politik itu seharusnya milik kita."" 

Seems like you are the one that didn't read the transcript.. I saw the PC he gave. Neither UM or the VC denied the claims. Why become VC of a university if you don‚Äôt want to meet the students? Its baffling.. no no you got it the other way. before this we are bombarded and teached that protest can be done in a peaceful manner like Bersih (to some extent).

now everyone know, should and encouraged to protest in a way in the rudest, disrespectful way possible because ultimately *it was about the message not the protest* also the peace of mind knowing it will not be punished and may even make you into a superstar. 

i look forward to what kind of protest will be done next.. The upper classes will always look after themselves. Wheres our class solidarity?. when i said drama i don't mean the Malay supremacism. chill. iirc, based on the video i watched he bring paper written ""undur VC"" and ""ini tanah Malaysia"". The message is not clear there. in audience perspective they might assume it just another drama/performance/ads/love confession. everyone like ""wtf"". 
Even its not the right place, he got media attention and explain the reason he did that. that is nice but to interrupt a university convocation event is not very nice, no?

idk maybe i just don't really understand what a protest is. or maybe i thought protest only can work only with many supporters shouting the people passion together like bersih last time. bersih demo was very good tho.. Since they will do so anyway, why make it easier for them?  Disrupting the convocation gives theem that ammunition.  Protesting on a separate occation or even outside of the hall on the same day would be a lot more effective because his opponents wouldn't have *that* particular excuse to dismiss him.. I oppose protests on general principle because of that disruptive nature and so I think there's no appropriate time and place for it.  I have also historically being strongly against the Bersih protests for the same reason (among others).

However, my point is that if you *are* going to be a dick to others and have a protest anyway, then you should pick a time and place which will focus attention on your message and not on the disruption you cause to others.  Make the sufferinf and inconvenience others feel actually mean something.  Hence, an ""appropriate time and place"".

For a given value of ""appropriate"".. Nice strawman, but I'm pretty sure it's okay to be Malay.. His speech is about Malay empowerment, not sending Chinese and Indian to concentration camp, y'all are weak thinking Malay empowerment is racism. An act that doesn't affect the Chinese nor Indian to the level it is harmful.. Because they know they‚Äôre in the wrong and just inviting more scrutiny which they don‚Äôt want.. Do read properly. I don't think anyone is saying that protest couldn't be done in a peaceful manner. In fact, isn't this protest peaceful? But for a lone wolf protest, doing it the same way as when there are numbers would be really *effective* huh? Effective is the keyword in my previous post.. None, because the upper classes are smart enough to use racial and religious struggles to stop us. Or maybe, some of us (of all backgrounds) are just dumb enough to never see past those.. The rich dont want us to have that. Thats why we're still divided by religion and race until now. Vote PSM!. > but to interrupt a university convocation event is not very nice

State-enforced racism is not very nice either. If someone complaints to me about the former, I would tell them to pay attention to the latter.

I repeat again that while it's good to be polite, I don't expect and fully understand that [you don't have to when you're fighting injustice]( > Since they will do so anyway, why make it easier for them?

To make people more aware. To have more impact. Maybe if you're angry that your convocation is interrupted, you can channel some anger towards the mistreatment of non-Bumis.

Again, I don't give a rat's ass about what Malay supremacists think. I've had enough of their shit, it's time I show more faith towards the under~~dog~~cat.. Generally speaking, any ""appropriate"" protest is an ineffective protest, might as well as not protesting. That's what the bersih protests were, just a display of numbers.

Specifically in this case, I believe the suffering and inconvenience is minimal if any at all? I guess you should stop at saying you don't like protest, and that's alright, I think.. Accuse others of strawman then strawman them, impressive.. > it's okay to be Malay

No one said otherwise.. OK, dude, let's wait until the racism gets harmful then only we do something about it amirite? Thanks for the admission that it's racist though, looks like you have read the transcript.. you are right. no one ever say that protest could not be done in a peaceful manner. but in light of recent event why should they? is there any reason to protest peacefully after this when people collectively agree that protest should be rude, protest should be disruptive and people should look at the massage rather than the act of protest nor the effectiveness of the protest itself. 

and thats why i look forward to what kind of protest will be done next. what is state enforced racism? thanks for the link btw. idk. i'm just thinking that maybe. just maybe he could find a better option than what he did.. Then the message gets lost amidst the anger.  Angry people do not think rationally; they will not direct that angry to something else that easily.  It doesn't work.. > what is state enforced racism?

It is racism that is enforced by the state.. In a separate report, the graduate stated that he had repeatedly asked for meetings with the VC to bring up his frustrations with the speech made, but he was ignored. Furthermore, I can't think of a ""better option"" for a protest if the intent was to draw attention to his dissatisfaction with the VC. He got what he came for, the whole nation is aware now. 

What is the point of a protest if it goes largely ignored?. Really?

The dude denounces the VC, and everyone in the room got so angry they lost all reason? 

Either you're over-estimating the anger they felt, or the entire room is so full of fragile dumbasses they don't deserve consideration.. is it the same as institutional racism?
what if your parent ask you to work harder like the asian neigbour wake up early in the morning collecting money. is this count as racist? sorry if im asking wierdly. just curious because my parent was like this when im a teenager.. yea i agree that a protest must be heard. but if that is the only reason to allow a protest at any place/event, i'm afraid this will become normal event happen in every university convocation in Malaysia every year.. Really.  

Not in the way you describe, but in the way the talk about the incident is split between his protest of the VC and the way he did it (and the events surrounding that).    Hell, *we* are doing the latter right now.

This is important because, if he wants his protest to power an actual social movement, he needs to sway more than the people who already more or less think like him anyway.  He needs to bring the people who *aren't* hardcore Malay chauvinists, who don't see whatever it is in the VC's speech is so objectionable, who think that there is some merit in what the VC says, onto his side.  And he can't do that by making them angry or give an excuse for the hardcore chauvinists can use to distract from his message.

Which, since as proven by the fact that you and I aren't arguing about the VC's speech, is exactly what has happened.. > is it the same as institutional racism?

Yes.

>  what if your parent ask you to work harder like the asian neigbour wake up early in the morning collecting money

What?. I understand your concerns on it being repeated by others in future, that is a valid one. Still, my question remains. Where else could have the student protested without inconveniencing anyone else, but also having a similar result with regards to attention by the public?

Everyone easily speaks so easily of protests at the ""right time and place"" but I have yet to see even one suggestion that fits this bill while also achieving similar results.. > He needs to bring the people who aren't hardcore Malay chauvinists, who don't see whatever it is in the VC's speech is so objectionable, who think that there is some merit in what the VC says, onto his side. And he can't do that by making them angry

Look, let's just decode this logical word salad and simplify it.

Take a hypothetical Malay guy, A.

Is A a rational person?

No --> nothing short of self-awakening can help

Yes --> then he won't be irrationally angry at a few minute's disruption

If you're saying that A is ""rational"" in a sense that he's not a ""hardcore Malay chauvinist"", but so fragile that a few minutes of questioning the narrative (""nothing in the VC's speech is racist"") will make him irrationally angry, then the first part of this post is already false.

What sort of moron would discount everything just because of a few minute's interruption? Dude's either an idiot or have anger issues.

> you and I aren't arguing about the VC's speech

That's because my opinion is that anyone who actually attends those ridiculous conference is a Malay supremacist. 

__________

Let me conclude this post with this: ***fuck politeness***

If you think you can fight injustice with scraping, bowing and licking boots, more power to you. Hell, if you did manage to turn things around, just remind me and I'll type a nice, unconditional apology message.

But in my nearly four decades of life and seeing we Malaysians actually ***regress***, anyone who hems and haws about ""playing nice"" needs a dose of reality. And I'm talking as a Bumi. I can only imagine the anguish the non-Bumis - and non-Muslims feel sometimes. 

Who with even a bit of righteousness in his soul can look at all that and think, ""but we need to be polite to the entrenched state-enforced racism""?. idk. i'm not very wise in protesting procedure or rules myself. idk really. to me convocation event is too meaningful, a time for everyone to cherish the moment,  like independence day for students. a day to thanks the supervisors, friends from different background/countries.. I believe I said it before dude, but your moderate stance gives me all the hope I need to keep believing that we would turn out alright, even if we may not agree in everything; and we need not be anyway.

Steal idea from working artist and use slave student labour. Bravo, more China than a Chinaman boss

>KOTA KINABALU: A local artist has questioned the resemblance between a mural adorning a concrete grandstand at Padang Merdeka here and the design he submitted to the Kota Kinabalu City Hall (DBKK), saying he was made to understand that the project had been called off.  
Crig Francis said he was approached in February last year by an officer from DBKK‚Äôs economics, tourism and international relations bureau who asked for a concept design for the mural.  
Francis, known locally as Cracko Art, said the officer asked him to come up with three designs to be used as part of DBKK‚Äôs efforts to beautify the city.  
‚ÄúBut her request was very general, so I had to really think about how to make it interesting,‚Äù he told FMT.  
Several weeks later, he submitted his designs along with his quotations.  
‚ÄúI waited for some time before following up, but they told me the project could be postponed or cancelled,‚Äù he added.  
After the general election in May, he said, he was told that the project had been called off. But he was later informed by a friend that it would proceed.  
He said he was fine with this but told his friend he hoped his designs would not be used.  
When the project began, he said, his friend sent him a screenshot of the mural design.  
‚ÄúMy heart dropped when I saw how similar it was to one of my designs.‚Äù  
According to him, the only difference was the addition of an orangutan and rafflesia flower.  
‚ÄúThe colour scheme all followed my design. I can understand if they followed a design from the internet, but I never shared my proposals on social media or showed them to anyone other than the DBKK officer,‚Äù he said.  
Francis said he reached out to DBKK but was told that no one knew who had commissioned or painted the mural. He also tried to catch the officer who approached him at a recent event in the city but was unsuccessful.  
He said he eventually discovered that the mural had been painted by four students from a local institution but added that no names were given.  
He spoke to the press about the matter yesterday, following which he said he received a call from the office of the Kota Kinabalu mayor.  
‚ÄúThe mayor‚Äôs personal assistant said the mayor had asked me to come to his office to talk, but I had to go outstation for work,‚Äù he said, adding that he might go by next week instead.  
‚ÄúAll I want is a public apology from the person in charge, and a promise from DBKK that they will not do the same thing again.‚Äù  
When contacted, mayor Nordin Siman said he only learnt of the matter after reading the news.  
‚ÄúMy officers are checking and conducting a probe,‚Äù he told FMT.  
‚ÄúThe DBKK director-general was supposed to meet the artist this morning, but that didn‚Äôt take place.  
‚ÄúWe will find out about this and let you know soon.‚Äù. Out of curiosity, how would a contract help in this case? Just trying to better understand the freelance world.. no contract means you're literally giving out free design and consultation. A contract for this kinda job can just be a ""sign off"" or acknowledgement that a design has been submitted with terms and condition e.g. cannot use if the project is cancelled. At least then he would have a document at hand instead of a verbal one. Now, the contractor can just say ""oh you never say I can't use it, sorry for the misunderstanding.""",669.0,8,1,0

Plenty of interior design and ad agencies pay for such ""awards"", no shortages of awards. 

Just google search ""CEOWorld magazine"", looks dodgy as hell. Nothing but stock photos and paid rankings. Not even a real magazine, more like a blog. A bad ciplak of [The CEO Magazine](

 Lol ...CEOWORLD ..yes..very credible source. It's paid to promote. There's no need for any adversary towards Singapore. Can't we just leave each others alone?. Because we never spend money to do these promotions. I'm gonna say because we are such a big country that all the best foods are scattered around the states and outside of the city proper, unlike Singapore where its small, everything is centralized and getting from place to place is easy peasy Japaneasy.  

Tourists tend to stay in the city center and lets be honest there isnt really much around ur usual KLCC or Jalan Alor are except traps.. Well it could be lots of things, like bias, advertising or bias. Also, all the food listed are mostly found in Malaysia and are also famous for it. Just you see, in a few years time, every food that is famous or well known in Malaysia and sold in Singapore will be acknowledged as from Singapore by the international community.. Rome, Berlin, Paris, Dubai known for street food?

What about Taipeh? Osaka? and of Course KL?

Kinda biased list that one.... never mind laaaa. let it be, let it beeee...... 1. Cleaner.
2. ALL types of food under one roof, including pork sold by chinese and halal food by muslims.. What? Even Bangkok lost to Singapore? Singapore doesn't even have a ""street food"". And when Malaysia is not even on the list, I know the list is shit.

The fact that they rank Paris at No.15 is just too funny. Paris has almost zero street food culture. They have cafes and restaurants but you rarely see food vendors on the street. It's very expensive to eat out in Paris.

Furthermore, the food capital Penang was ranked the best food destination in the world by Lonely Planet a few years ago and it's not even in the top 50? I sincerely doubt the rankings.. For those interested here's their methodology: 

'*Methodology: The 50 cities were selected after reviewing numerous ‚Äúbest street food cities‚Äù lists and included those cities that appeared more than once. To get a figure for the number of street food vendors in each city CEOWORLD magazine analysed street food data in Google Maps. CEOWORLD magazine used Numbeo to find out the current price of an inexpensive meal in each city. Data from UNICEF was used to rank the cities by food hygiene. The Street Food City Index 2019 ranks the cities on 4 parameters: number of street food vendors, affordability, number of street food experiences, and food hygiene.'*. Only Malaysians think their food is the best in the world.

It is so-so -  not so bad, but no so awesome either.. Dubious source, looks like a paid promotion mill, and in any case it asks the questions from business people, and not food critics or the public.

Singapore has poor street food for one simple reason: they heavily control the street business.

Street food is good because it's an example of Darwinian natural selection. In Malaysia anyone can find themselves a street side or corner and set up a stall with minimal investment. Their product might be good or bad. If it's bad it will just disappear, but if it's good it will attract a large audience. Since the entry barrier is low many people can give it a try. Real food talent gets discovered and celebrated.

Edit: The Singaporean government are aware of this and are encouraging food trucks and food fairs/festivals so that new food talent can be nurtured.

Edit 2: [I found the primary source.]( Here's their joke of a methodology:

The results make me scratch my head. Like how is Singapore number 1? I been to Singapore for 7.5 years and the food there is really mediocre compared to Malaysia food.

You just go to some random Mamak stall in Malaysia and we already have better food. Just makes one wonder how this happen.. CEOWorld? Did they use Gardner ranking for street food?. Cause we pretty much only do it for a month each year(not including pasar malam & pasartani which do not focus on selling food rather supplies) and street food has no seats for bikers to hangout at. Tourism minister is sleeping. I can't name one Singaporean street food actually.

> According to business travellers and corporate travel agents that were interviewed

C'mon. But to be fair we don't even have a street food street. Just pasar malam. Is there a touristy spot with an entire street dedicated to food? All our street food is like spread throughout.. Because the world knows where singapore is, and not malaysia. I would have to tell people we are sandwiched between vietnam and singapore. Or just say that piece of land sticking out IS malaysia and singapore is that speck of dust next to it.. Didn't take all of awhile for /r/singapore to start throwing shade...

Also, if there's anything for me to get mad about, I'm pissed over Singapore trying to claim a UNESCO heritage that belongs to all of us in S.E.A, not just Singapore.. In that respect, what kinda sites do u think are best rankers of food that were not paid? Blogs?. Yeahh. oh so it is like that time when the Malaysian ramen won first place.. All their sayur,fruit,raw material also comes from the best pick from Cameron Highland.. Gee golly, I wished we had a Ministry of Tourism with government money to promote our food. /s. Singapore is a city state. We should compare them to other states. Not to whole countries.  This is the major problem with promoting Malaysian food.  


Each of our own states too have their own variations of Malaysian favourites. Take Laksa for instance. Every state has it's own version. Each is tasty in its own right. But when, for example a Penangite eats Laska in Johore, he or she will almost inevitably says it isn't authentic.  


Then the Penangite will go on a tirade telling the rest of us that it is called curry mee not Laksa. And a Sarawakian will insist it was invented in Sarawak and all of the rest are copies.  


How are we to promote our own food when we can't even agree what it is?. Nah. More like the world don't even know where Malaysia is. I have to tell them we are sandwiched between singapore and vietnam. VIETNAM!!! They know where vietnam is but not us!!! TBF, the americans fucked up vietnam so the whole world knows them.. Same thing can be said about Singapore...Street food at Orchard road? Chinatown? Maxwell hawker center? MBS? Those choices are barely passable as street food. All the locations listed in that article are not even found at those popular tourist destinations. Come on, they even listed Toastbox as the must try ""street food"". Toastbox!. If convenience is your criteria for good food, you must as well try McDonalds. Besides, nobody ever had food poisoning in KL, local or foreigners. You obviously never visited KL if you think the food here is unhygienic.. Dubai #11. I lived in Dubai and it‚Äôs pretty much shit. So we can all forget this list and move on.. Street food isn't exactly hygenic per se....

Edit - i think if you promote as heavily as Singapore does, it skews the ranking. Because you are looking at it from the perspective of a none South East Asian and you will know why SG beats out other SEA nations when it comes to popularity of its cuisine.. exactly. Its all over the place that if im a tourist, it'd be a bitch to go from A to B unless u have a local to take u around.  

SG on the other hand, just take train enough d.. Does Jalan Alor count?. At least we have Pasar malam. Does Singapore even have street food? All they have are Food courts, no?. >	the world knows where singapore is

Which is funny considering back then, nobody knew where Singapore is and or everyone thinks Singapore is in China (still happens).

Ah... the wonders of the tourism industry.. Michelin star is kinda reputable, although it is very euro-centric. But really, trying to compare like this is stupid because every country has good food, it's just a matter of which place matches your own personal palette.. I don't know which one you're talking about. Sometimes it's legit but most times, it's just paid promotions. You just gotta check the legitimacy of the website. In this case, a company calling itself ""CEOWorld magazine"" but publishes no magazines, you know lah (it's a ciplak of The CEO magazine btw)... They don't even have a real award to give out lol. Anyone can do that and claim it's ""world's best"".. visit trully asia malaysia 2020. What we need IMO is a centralized location in KL maybe selling all types of laksa.. I was in the US once and they mistook me as a Mexican.  

Oh well, cant blame them. Bet you that we cant tell Europeans apart from their country of origin (leaving the obvious ones out like dark skinned ones) if we were to be presented with a few.. FYI Food Junction just got bought over by Breadtalk in SG heheh. Whoever listed that probably has a big fat wallet.. Singapore's street food according to the list was chicken rice, laksa and roti prata. ??? How is that street food ah.. Not really. That's just eating by the street lmao. Let me help you with that sentence there.

""Ah... the wonders of money."". Because the only important element in a campaign logo is the emblem.. That would be one way, but easier if we as Malaysians can celebrate our diversity.   


Let each state promote its own food and hope that those pesky Penangites don't come and shit all over the place.   


Would it not be nice if say Terengannu had a food fair in KL one week and Kelantan the next? Singapore too could join in and Malaysians would not feel jealous of them anymore.. Not worth the economy I think..

You need to cook at least 6 types of kuah, and 3? Types of mee.. Lot 10 has centralized most famous street food stalls, or so i've heard.. They thought I was from vietnam for my first few weeks. Just got off the plane and I still have that dark skined look that makes some chinese look vietnamese.. Most of the hawker centres or food courts are owned by the same company. So no surprise here. The hawker scene is dying out to be honest due to high rental and lack of fresh blood to continue the business. That‚Äôs why you see a lot of news articles about ‚Äúprofessionals quitting their job to become a hawker‚Äù in an attempt to revitalise the hawker scene.. i think back then someone has write a well written post about brand and marketing in context of this logo and for the love of me i cannot find back that post.. Malaysians are never jealous about Singaporeans food. They are just annoyed of their publicity stunts. You only see Singaporeans queuing up for Malaysian food and never the other way around.. I don't see it working all that well. yeah. we are those disgruntled stall owner that located at the back alley, scowling at those branded chained food stalls popping up everywhere, stealing attention and business.

this is one of the time that despite human advancement in science and physic the best card we can play is to delay the inevitable because we cant solve the problem without creating more problem. see that small stone island? thats one of the solution, but directly in-front of the island the beach move forward towards the island, that's sediment trap..

Giving an option wont hurt right?  

Remember guys, context is everything.. Rm 50k for a parking lot? Wtf is he smoking? 5 years ago, the most was rm10k.. With lesser car park, they'll just end up parking on the road like many other areas. agree, but what if, for no swimming pool entirely?
it can drastically decrease the cost.. wow... Loke: Tidak semua orang yang beli rumah memiliki kenderaan. Daripada mereka tidak guna parking tersebut, lebih baik kita berikan pilihan untuk beli rumah tanpa parkir pada harga lebih murah

Soam: Setiap tempat letak kereta menelan belanja RM50,000. Kita boleh turunkan harga rumah!!

 no swimming pool options can also lessen the cost.yes?. House prices will also be cheaper if it doesn't come with bricks, paint, door, windows, tiles... just use straw, environmentally friendly.. Dangerous to have logical narrative in housing issue. 

Anyway, I am here for my daily ""fUCk GrEEdY DeVElOpeRs!!!!1!!1!!!!"" dose.. Wouldn't that instead put a premium on them?. Actually this is true sadly. I just bought a rumah Selangorku. The parking lot was rm20k.  N this was a cheap house. Imagine the normal pricing houses. Before i decided on that i was looking at Lbs & ecoworld in puncak alam.. Based on what i know from housing loans, the cost of a parking is memang separate from the condo.. If the cost to build swimming pool be divided with the numbers of home owners, it really doesn't add up that much compared to carparks.. Lower housing price by five figures, this lessens monthly installment by hundreds, instead home owners can rent carpark spaces near their houses. How is this a bad idea?. straw is banned. That's called buying dilapidated properties. Technically, it's way more expensive since you would need to clear it and build a new house from scratch.. I'm not commenting on the housing issue in general.... Just saying that it's easy to take one sentence a politician says, be it BN or PH, omit the context, and make him/her look like a fool, as you can see from the comments on this thread.  

Wee Ka Siong was a victim from kinitv because of this... Even BN guys like Zahid and Dahlan have on camera told kinitv to piss off because they like to mince their words and I sympathize with them.. Building carparks also increase the housing price. 

Plus, most of these public transport stations have their own multi-level carparks.. Yes, it seems that there is premium on projects close to public transport stations.. Some condos even have separate SPA for parking.. That‚Äôs... no longer the case post 2014 amendment. You can no longer buy additional car parks.. agree, but what if, for no swimming pool entirely?
it can drastically decrease the cost. No?. nice punch line.. Perfect rebuttal lol. Oh its housing issue, so the narrative is already set on ""ph only helps developers reeeeee"" level, regardless of kinitv mincing their words or not.

I understand what you mean.. It seems that basic principles of supply and demand apply here as well.. Well, it does, but I'm going back to my same old point. You want your daily dose of ""our gov cares only for the developers""? Oops, done it.. Yay, feels good to be charged up for no reason.. Oh nono, you were asking for it.

But one of the curry i cannot eat or else must be muslim suddenly.. I need amoi name for.  Uh. Thesis.. wtf myky y u also in reddit. Malay curry is oily. Just like my Malay gf‚Äôs face.

I know one of the girls in this pic.. Hmmm. As a curry lover, I approve of this message.. Nasi lemak version next ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). I enjoy eating rice with curry and kicap manis. I need to know the male version of the names for each race.. God bless Malaysia!. Considering this is Malaysia, my first thought was actually 'Full of lemak?'. But tbh, I do have crushes to malay and indian girls, but not to chinese girls 'cause they are cold...how ah?. Is this your original work, ah OP /u/kinwai ?

Cannot find the sos. Good one, btw.. I always fall for the ones with glasses. Idk why. Curry is good on rainy days like these. Yea sure the young ones are pretty, but the chicken rice aunty calls you lengchai everytime. can't beat that. Racist to the point even food gets labeled by race :D LOL    /s.

That's the only thing preventing more of us from dating them.. curry, fav food üòã. Racist and sexist at the same time... oh Malaysia.. Sauce for that Awek pls. curry without sauce?. I like japanese curry, but it‚Äôs usually not that hot. Gambar awek mana admin sebat ni ? XD. I may have tried it before, I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôll ask my wife..

Some people think they are witty when they say indians bau mcm kari.

Nak racist pun, jangan lah involve food. Bahalul. Where to find the Mina?. Eh sama... but i prefer indian kari. Cina got curry meh?

But all the girl is definitely hotter than the curry.. Hey bro, not cool. That ""awek"" taught me otorhinolaryngology and she's married to another lecturer.

Edit; btw, never tasted Chinese Curry, but Malay curry is overwatered and Indian curry is the best but will give you diarrhea.. This is so cringe.. Breathing in toxic burning plastic from Canada?. Well I prefer hobby & gaming over GFs. Gaming & GF-ing at the same time is a big NO NO. 

Imagine being in the middle of a Classic PUBG match and you're in the middle of an intense shootout of you, the only one alive in your Squad vs a whole squad, then suddenly a notif from your GF came out on your phone. Then when you're replying, after just a single tap on your phone's keyboard, the screen says ""Better luck next time!"".. I'm pretty sure Awek means Chinese girl, as for Malay girl I have no idea.. Japanese curry are savory   
They do not focus on spice because they warm up with sake.. Well I think is because Japanese is not Malaysian to begin with.. Our local curries are tier 1. 

Jap curry is probably tier 3, 2.5 at best. 
(Yeah also not hot enough, and lack spices). Can't see them cuz they all blurry. Well it‚Äôs my wife actually....

Hah thanks for noticing.. ""Al-Fatihah!"". But I heard Malay awek skillz very g00d.

Otherwise it‚Äôs just burn mouth. Huh wat u mea-

Thanks for the support! Appreciate it. Megane :D. For sho. Betul. Ciken rice Aunty > all. I really can‚Äôt explain it but really, each of the race‚Äô rendition of curry has distinctive difference to them. 

Doesn‚Äôt stop me from loving them though.. I know you're joking, but how else can we identify them?. [removed]. Admitting the existence of different race = racist?. U‚Äôll get there bro. Just keep improving yourself!. I not OKT la bro.. I xtau weh. Untung la. Me too.

well said. Jap curry very meh. Taste like chicken parettal (thick gravy chicken). I thought something special but it taste exactly like how I could make it.. Not bad but they all taste the same.. Press F to pay respects

tips: holler us monyets should you decide to go to twitter or instagram <3. Can confirm. Although I never tasted how the Chinese make theirs.. Yes, homemade recipes has a mother's touch that makes it unique.   
I always savour the flavour so never quite differentiated by ethnicity.   
Enjoy your curry.. That's why I did not say it is wrong. ;). [removed]. Why not just call them, curry?   
Or curry with more santan, curry with more chilli, curry with more tumeric ?. Same here boss, so sad lah.

But even sadder if the younger generation takes over, and still macam sama ja. How to enact positive change ahh?. man, should do a thread about that. Would the mod here allows it?. Malat chilli steamboat, cannot?. ? what i dont speak that. eh..please feel free to ignore it. I guess this comes from a personal bitterness more than anything. If there‚Äôs one thing I love about Sabah Sarawak is exactly this; ppl there are damn friendly and looks past race/religion/language!!. lmaooo A+ for effort. []( Canada ships its recycled plastic to Malaysia. Instead of recycling it, the plastic is burned causing harmful fumes for the local communities.. Shit we been had. I enjoy Japanese-style curry too.   
I would not trade one for another. I savour the taste of all curry. 

This is the reason why I do not see curry from a race stand point of view. But when you see so many downvotes, then you know how many racists Malaysians there are :D LOL. There are days when you want Japanese curry and there are days you want active bowel movement. üòè. F. Can confirm. Had one malay ex gf who rides harder than a motorbike. They be wild sometimes. Can confirm. Only 1 account, but thanks for checking. Was adding on haha.. I know what you mean.. Same dude. 

I just googled pretty <adjective> girl 

Hahaha. Hold up. I think u were thinking more on the ikan bakar kind kot. Yep. Sauce made from ground taucu, onions and garlic. Really savoury. Havent made it for a very long time but basically you sear some meats a bit, remove from pot, fry the blended paste, add water and stir, then put back the meat plus some potatoes and mushrooms. Tastes a lot better than it sounds. I suggest if taucu is in brine, to drain it first and add salt at the end because it may be hard to guess how much saltiness is needed. Bro whylah u bro, people waiting you cakap kidding

*sobs in perv*. OH BOY ME TOO. Oh shit bro. 

I srsly meant this as a joke. The pics I got from google nia. 

If it‚Äôs not good I‚Äôll take this post down. So sorry!!. 50/50. Actually should be jejaka (just realised your nick...) but Malays prolly use abam more :D. Malay girls mostly very friendly and approachable la. 

But I enjoy membawang with mak ciks. Hahah. Ooh ok thanks for the advice! 

For now I‚Äôm just on reddit and FB. I‚Äôm too unker to go twitter or IG hahaha. Let me consult my editor on that. I asked my MIL, who can cook all 3 types (cina, nyonya and india type) 

She also stopped and scratched her head.   
Something about the amount of salt, spice, santan and oil.. Chinese curry usually less spicy with more Santan. Some Chinese places get an Indian lady to come in and make the curry in the morning so those are more indian.. I do!

To be clear, I don‚Äôt have a problem with your comment. It‚Äôs just that we have been indoctrinated with the idea that the term ‚Äòracist‚Äô has a negative connotation to it. 

I honestly believe they have a distinct taste to each of them, so I do put race labels on them. 

As I said, doesn‚Äôt make me love them any lesser.. Remind me who were the ones that put tomatoes in their curries. Been state side a while and I am starting to mix the curries up when I try to cook them.. No u didn't, but u better include the /s. Nobody can tell ur tone on the internet. As you can see, u have already annoyed people, and initially me.. Alright. [removed]. Because are not caucasians. Here in malaysia we dont say rice steamed with coconut milk served with fried anchovies and savoury fried chilli paste on a banana leaf.

We just call it nasi lemak, duh. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing my part in drawing all these positive and humorous comic, to at least make ppl laugh. It also helped me to find funny things to draw about. 

Especially in fb, where almost all posts are complaints and rants. I wanna counter those.. I‚Äôve been toeing the line but they keeping me in check üòÜ

My stylus rosak liao. Need to buy a new one ASAP.. Alright man. Hope u‚Äôll have a good week ahead :). Care to spill some tea?. I here 4 u.. Da best. I think it‚Äôs all depend on individuals.  
At the very least, this is something very very petty to be argued about, and shouldn‚Äôt escalate any more. 

I also love whisky, but some heavily peated ones, I‚Äôve yet to be able to truly enjoy it for now.. It's not that deep. And there are days when you want Japanese crotch movement.   
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). Lmao. Ahah, oh boy this is so true.. Thanks!. It's came from Google it should be on Google image search as well. Done this trick with my theise on P***stars. Pro-tips: Safe search off. Wait a minute. I‚Äôm thinking of Devil‚Äôs Curry ;) I googled it, haha.. Shah Alam is my city. I'm going to Serawak on November 14. No worries, I don't have a problem with it. I'll report back if after work tomorrow and see whether she gets wind of it. Take your pick... Jejaka is too formal lol. Abam feels better üòÇ. Chinese uses more santan and less chilies. Ingredients also differ from family to family. Besides potatoes, my mom likes to use tofu skin, fried beancurd, lady fingers and even brinjals. The consistency of Chinese curry is also more watery compared to Indian or Malay curry.. Enjoy your curry.. I do not recall tasting tomatoes in curry.   
Stimulated by your question reminds me of a friend's homecook curry. He does one mean curry. He has return to Bangladesh.. Never knew LOL has no effect here.   
Sorry, no intention of annoying you or anymore.   
Posted a statement, OP was not annoyed or triggered. In fact, we talked even more about curry.   
People who do get triggered are mainly because of the prejudice they already have. u/dahteabagger is clearly wiser than the average nyets. Respect.. [removed]. Yet you don't call them Indian nasi lemak or Chinese nasi lemak, just nasi lemak, DUH.. I 100% agree man, only thing that can counter hate is love. Keep up the good work! 

Yaa haha I off my fb long time ago ody, too many ""keyboard warriors"" over there hahah. I was not arguing. Merely sharing that I enjoy all sorts of good curry.   
Earlier I joke about racist to segregate curry, it did not mean to offend anyone. Yet seeing some of the comments, let's see how many racist downvotes my comments gets :D LOL 

Glad you enjoy your liquor.. You are right. You have a good night.. Kimochiiiii. That escalated quickly ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). But i don't.. Why u censored popstar- oh... Jap. Ah true true. But no my MIL didn‚Äôt cook that version.. Jom ajak makan rendang. Haha okok. I take awek. Looks very ladylike.. Meh abam payungkan~. Can I come join ur family for dinner sometime?. You used it in pretty much everywhere u post sometimes i confused also if u really mean it.. [removed]. If got no difference then ofc la same. But remember that theres a significant difference between hainanese chicken rice and normal chicken rice.

We also dont use different names for roti canai whether its made by malays or at mamak, because theres not big a difference. When there is a significant difference, then obviously we use different words. We dont call all of them kari. Perhaps its not obvious to you, but most people in this country understand it with no problems.

We use words for many reasons. One of them is to differentiate between things. But we gotta be smart and not have to spend all day describing a thing. Your argument that we could just say ""curry with more santan"" is just stupid when ""kari india"" sends the message good enough.. Thanks dude. I‚Äôm also happy that I‚Äôve been getting really good support from fellow monyets here!!

Yeah screw those ppl. I realised engaging them only deteriorates my own self further. Better to just ignore.. Boku wa sekkusu dai suki. Senpai yameteee. Huh I thought he meant pawnstars.. Helo pulis. My Wife‚Äôs family on her Dad‚Äôs side are Peranakan and have Portuguese in them from a few generations back. They still cook this kind of food at home. As an outsider I find it very interesting, but the dishes are a bit too strong tasting or spicy for me. The wife gives me a bit of stick for it, lol.. Saya belum beli ayam untuk rendang. Awek taken already la chief unfortunately.. That's a little too nauseating for me üòÇ But fine. I LOL when I LOL ... found it funny.

61,MRT Ridership picking up - TheStar,dksvt4,2019-10-21 01:03:04,notexthere,20,1.0,11.0,"It's very easy to boost ridership, just build a lot of high density condo next to MRT stations.

The same way we boost usage of highways by crowding all the exit points with housing estates.. > Latest ridership data from Prasarana Malaysia Bhd ‚Äì the operator of the MRT and LRT network in Klang Valley ‚Äì showed that in August, the MRT recorded an average of 208,000 riders each working day.  
  
>  
>As a comparison, the Ampang LRT Line in July averaged 209,000 users on any given working day.  
  
>  
>This is significant considering that the Ampang line opened in December 1996 while the MRT is only two years old. The Kelana Jaya LRT line remains the most used, averaging 326,000 users for each weekday in July.

This is actually pretty good. I remember taking the MRT once off-peak hours and there weren't much people, so thought it was running through too many rich areas where people already had cars, guess my initial conclusion was off.. When Grab took over Uber's operation, there were no real contenders, prices are higher. So people would take MRT. Then probably Grab a ride from station to destination. Better for the budget.. Mrt buses are the most convenient public transport i have ever used. Great news, hopefully it keeps more cars off the road. I still think there's a way to go to figure out the first- and last-mile logistics (more buses and more extensive bus routes ahem), but one step at a time..

62,"Haha, very cool abang motor.",dks8mu,2019-10-21 00:08:22,notexthere,576,0.99,40.0,"Lol I remember when fuel price were jacked up to RM2.70 per liter like 10 years back and there were tons of people queueing up to fill their cars before the new petrol price comes into effect. 

In a petrol station there are four pumps in one lane; 2 pumps on the left and right row. The two outer pumps were occupied by two Alphards, thus blocking the access to the two inner pumps for other cars. Me, riding a motorcycle, simply rode up to the inner pumps and when I looked back at the motorists who are queueing up, I get the cibai look from them.. Worst ones are those who parks their car at a pump then goes to the toilet, buys a dozen things after visiting the ATM, then comes back to their car, and use their credit card to fuel up. 5 cars could have fuelled up and be on their merry way.. And they say Vios is king of cars :D LOL. Slides into your way

Cha cha real smooth. There was once when I queued up on my bike (yes, I‚Äôm the one that does that). The person in front of me finished filing her car with petrol, entered her car and started make up inside the car. I had to press the horn in order to rush her up but I felt bad also at the same time haha.. Speedy Wonder. Most of the time, the motorcycle only pump have Ron95 only. But at my place, we have both 95 and 97 for the motorcycle. So, whenever there is a lot of motorcycle, we will have to make a long queue just because they decided to put 97 pump instead of both 95.. Lol at the petrol station I usually act in concert with the motors by letting them through and waiting for them to finish before sliding in. Sometimes I cluster the inner one with them  nearby. Apparently most people who drive cars only use the outer pump. Tbh I think those motorbikes at the petrol station are more courteous than a good number of cars (though I myself is a car person). Happens all the time. Every abang motor ever.. Haven't seen motor doing this but I just had a Myvi cut my queue out of no where the other day and almost hit my car.. [removed]. To me, it's another story of cheebye alphards.. Ah yes, it was fun to watch 5-series, Vellfires, Audis, Mercs and a host of other premium cars queuing up.. But if the pump has sign for bikers, those motorists should not use that pump (but also seen bikers use another pump bcs dowan to queue up at designated pump). >fuel price were jacked up to RM2.70

I'll be broke if that happened today. Some people just want to watch the world burn.. oops. not king, godcar. Rich people became rich by learning the importance of each penny.. What about Lexus. There's no designated pumps for bikes at that station.. Thank you for the correction.. It seems to suggest that the 'folks' that you mentioned don't like the truth and neither do everyone c:. If that were true they would all be driving Myvis or X70s.

And real rich people don't queue up for petrol at any price ‚Äî time lost from that sort of waiting is more costly than to save a few ringgit for a commodity that will permanently be needed to run their cars.. If I'm rich I'll probably get myself a Tesla Model 3. No one becomes truly rich by becoming frugal like filling fuel for one night. Only wannabe rich do that. May have seen a few CTH2100 (?) but I don't recall. Can afford the car, cannot afford the petrol.. Real rich people will probably have someone else queue up for them.. Yea, a few ringgit is not a big deal honestly. You don‚Äôt have to be rich either too, is the inconvenience really worth with a few ringgit?. They have a driver, they already pay them anyway, and car already paid for anyway, so getting cheap fuel is saving you money still.. are you saying that you can afford the car and not the petrol? Or referring to others? 

Isn‚Äôt the CT a hybrid? It should give insane fuel efficiency. I asked the same thing to my own friends and colleagues  ‚Äî quite a few of them tend choose to take the long, windy, unknown roads that  just to avoid having to pay toll, not realising that the stops at the traffic lights and jams can be costlier than to pay RM2.10 (for example) and smooth, fuel efficient driving on the highways.. It's just a general remark I tease my friends and colleagues who complain about living costs  ‚Äî  while playing with their RM5k iPhones.. lol in KL a paid highway is often a gridlock that is no better than a non tolled road just as anyone who had to pass by the Sunway LDP toll everyday would know .. Wait, Long windy roads? Is this like in KL? Cause in Penang, there is usually just one major way to get to a destination since it is so small. Unless you are talking about the smaller roads. 

But yea, same with my dad. Always complaining about gas but takes the roads with lots of traffic lights and stops as opposed to the highway or such.. Ohhh, well TBF your smartphone is something you use everyday for hours on end. It is not a bad idea to pay a premium for phones even if it‚Äôs 5k (don‚Äôt tell Tim Cook I said this!). 

Now if you are buying a premium smartphone every year, then yea you can‚Äôt complain about living costs. Well Penang you sometimes have choices where you can follow the main roads and be stuck at the lights, or a windy narrow road that's 5km extra but with less lights/traffic so you end up arriving at the same time.. The windy narrow roads are the ones near the hills right?. Yeah Balik Pulau, Mt Erskine, Tun Sadon",1021.0,5,1,0

Repeat as necessary. Here's a clarification, let's take this scenario for example. 

When you see, ""buy 3 satay, get 2 free"" it doesn't mean you only pay for 1 satay. It means that you buy 5 satay, only to pay for 3.

Therefore, if you only buy 6 satay, you'll only receive 2 free satay. In order to get 4 free satay, you need to buy 10 satay, but only paying for 6.

Thing is when my family members call them out on it they're like ""but that's what they are"". I downvoted you for saying that. There we go.. The leg bone is connected to the knee bone. I know Islam, it's a great religion, in fact it's the best religion in the world.

They have the best messenger and prophet, Muhammad (pbuh), which God said, will be the last, and we all know last means good, because he is so great that we wouldn't need another one.

Islam also has the best book in world. The only book that remains readable in the written language of that time, which is the best language of the world, and of course I mean Arabic, and not just any form of Arabic, but archaic Arabic  which by the way was invented by the best race of the world. 

Today, I'm converting to Islam, which I'm very proud of myself doing so, and I'm sure Islam would be proud to have me as their believer as well, and God, also known as Allah in Arabic, would be proud of me as well. 

I'm calling myself Dawnalid Turmib from now on, which is a great name, so great that no one in the world has another name like mine, which make my name so unique, and making myself the only person with that name.. Is it to the death or the first to concede?. I recommend chickens.. Ugh.... Bravo!. Ko dah knape pukimak sial?!!    /s. Making Malaysia great again! 

- Dawnalid Turmib. not just the people, the royalty too. I doubt they would want to abolish Malay rights even though they are not Malays, because royalty is often seen as the defender of Islam and Malay rights in Malaysia. Take away the Malay rights, and I don't think royalty would still be relevant by then. It doesn't have to be a bad thing though. Sure generally races are being used in negative context. 

But i've been in many situation where races are mentions in a positive way.. Damn you. The earth is round. ""Ahmad"" Dawnalid Turmib bro... Gotta be a servant to be accepted as a convert.. The royalty is literally existing just because the Malays still believe in their god given right to rule

You can bet that if equality is ever a thing that the rakyat is fully embracing... The royals would use all their wealth to pull back to status quo. It doesn't sound bad. But there do you draw the line between this and ""typical of this person because they are (insert race here) so that's why they always act like that"" or ""(insert race is hardworking/lazy/stingy) 

It's like why do you have to reefer someone to their race at all. Unless you're trying to identify someone I see no other reason. Yeah but no need to bring it up if it's not relevant kot..... Sorry the earth is flat.


/s. > Ahmad

I think you mean Abdullah? I may be wrong..

Besides, ""converting"" from Christianity to Islam still considered converting meh? I thought they just sorta like ""upgrade"" only? Which is kinda different from converting from non-Abrahamic religions. yep can't say they have no vested interests in maintaining the status quo. but isn't your relative using race as a description/identifier? haha. *flat circle.    

**/s**. Oops. Abdullah I guess.

Seeing as Islamic doctrine says being a Christian is shirk and lands you straight into hell (and Christian doctrine doesn't acknowledge Muslims as believers), I don't think it's a matter of upgrade or downgrade so conversion would be the appropriate term (that is, leaving one faith/religion for another). Unless you're talking about Chrislam, but neither devout Muslims nor Christians would associate with that mixed up crap.. It's unecessary.

It's quite common to see skinheads and punks around KL especially Bukit Bintang in the mid to late 90s. Leather jackets, 18 hole doc martens and mohawks are their fashion statement.. **Relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world**

The relationship between Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì1945) and the leadership of the Arab world encompassed contemptandpropaganda, collaboration. Cooperative political and military relationships were founded on shared hostilities toward common enemies, such as British and French imperialism and colonialism, communism, and Zionism. Part of the reasons for this collaboration was that Nazi Germany was perceived as an objective ally.Hajj Amin al-Husayni Mufti of Jerusalem was in contact with Hitler in an attempt to stop the flow of Europe Jews entering his country Palestine with the help of the British pursuing the Balfour declaration in 1917. (see Antisemitism in Islam).

What offerings would you guys bring to his shrine?. I picture a potential scenario in parliament. Gobind Singh proposes a law, an opposition politician rejected it, saying i have visited your father and asked for divine blessings on this law but he said no. üòÇüòÇüòÄ. Did you guys know theres a malay deity as well?. I wonder what are the criteria someone needed to obtain godhood? Is tunku Abdul Rahman being worshipped right now?. B r u h. I see these everywhere but they are commonly called KFC shrines.. Apparently ""datuk Kong"" are actually model after Cheng Ho, which is a Muslim, hence we don't offer pork to Datuk Kong.. Get your late Datuk Karpal plushies that laughs at midnight at your nearest store now! The first 37 customers will get the Early Bird 50% discount.. Well, what can u expect from institutionalized religion? Got to keep up the times yo. Anything except beef i guess?. There's an area named as such. Kampung Dato' Keramat.. Well respected by chinese i guess? Taoism is all about worshipping the souls, not really need to be god to be worthy of worship. But i guess if they decided to worship TAR it will kick up a shit storm.. It's not godhood, just a level of deity, being seen as a big contributor to the society is normally sufficient for that. And if you read the post, datuk kong actually translated as ""deity datuk"" so traditionally they are Malays being worshipped; TAR is a possibility (somewhere a deity is being modeled after him, it's a loose belief anyway).. If they are loved by the community or a powerful and respected figure or both, similar to  sainthood or guardian angels.. *datuk Kong*s are local earth deities, and thus local *datuk*s are assumed to be Islamic in nature. Got nothing to do with Cheng Ho.. Terms and condition applied.. I dont think taosim is an institutionalized religion, there is no central command, each on their own, no standard way of praying and etc. Buddhism is but not taosim.. Quite the opposite. It's taoism + superstition + spiritualism + occult, very much like Sai Baba... Very rojak.

""Institutionalized religion"" means organized religion.. Don't guess, learn about your neighbours.

As his name clearly suggest, Karpal Singh was a Punjabi, and also a Sikh.

Not a Hindu, hence no religious restriction against eating beef.

I do not know if he did eat beef.. yea i am actually aware about chinese practice that put legendary characters up for worship, some sort of sainthood like mother Teresa for the Catholics.  I just fascinated that people who are recently deceased can also be deified. Makes me wonder what other revered people have shrines in temples right now.. I thought so too until I read about Cheng Ho and people make sculpture model after Cheng Ho for remembrance and it looks similar to Datuk Kong.. [deleted]. Yea but most Sikhs don‚Äôt eat beef too, it‚Äôs somewhat of a restriction due to culture I guess (people often assume that it‚Äôs due to religious reasons). Personally I don‚Äôt follow that.. Oh, I believe the deities we have know were actually deitified (?) as soon as they have deceased otherwise we wouldn't have known them today. Just a speculation though.. Cheng Ho has his own temple with his statue. Datuk Kong temple usually only has songkoks, no statue.. Maybe they have a Taoism Association, but it doesn't have a structure that says every temple must pray like this or that, or have this or go promote that. Each temple run their own temple as they see fit. Like Hinduism. Institutionalize religion are Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and etc. A singh friend explained to me that their culture dont eat beef because cow's are like mothers, they provide milk and work very hard.. Or a piece of rock, anthill, etc.. Thats actually a Hindu belief, with Hindu being the dominant religion in India as well as Sikhism having some hindu roots, as well as there was a law in India which prohibited cow slaughtering (in Punjab) hence why I said its more of a cultural thing. There is no particular animal that is better or more sacred in Sikhism. Only Sikhs that have been baptized (taken Amrit) have restrictions on what they can eat, a lot of them are vegetarians and those who are not, cant consume any halal or kosher meat.. How about buffalo?",755.0,2,1,0
79,"UCSI students, I call you for help in my time of need (If you're in the 3D Animation Course, but opinions about the campus in general are welcome)",dkcsvo,2019-10-20 01:14:35,"So in summary i'm at the last few months of the final semester, and currently i'm taking a Diploma in Animation Multimedia and Design (2D Animation), and have thought of going to UCSI to further my Degree to their 3D Animation course.  **(i have thought about MMU and LKW Cyber, i'm a LKW student and they're not my first choice based on experience ).** I've been on many forums and Reddit threads though most of them don't have much details about this specific course, and i'd like to know more about:

Regardless of course Q&A:

* General overall experience of studying under UCSI 
* Facilities, how would you rate them?
* Student life, and who to avoid (or look out for) 
* Stuff that you wished you would've known but regrettably learned late TM
*  Do they provide transfer of credit for Diploma holders *(because i've looked at the modules and they look similar to what i've done, including MPU subjects)*
* As someone who's not a local in the area, where do ya'll stay at besides the dorms
* for those who has stayed in dorms, how's your experience so far

Animation Course Q&A:

* Are the Animation Course lecturers efficient at what they do? are they easy to work with? 
* How're the modules and the classes? would you say it's enjoyable? 
* Do they provide the necessary tools for students (3D / 2D animation software and etc.) 
* Facilities regarding Labs, would you say the workspace environment  is good

&#x200B;

I'm flying out to west Malaysia in a few months for an art event and most likely dropping by the main campus to ask generally the same questions but I'd like to know more from people who have personally experienced it themselves here",11,0.83,4.0,"Background on me: Have a degree already from overseas. Decided to further studies locally cause cheaper. Completing my first semester in UCSI soon.

Facilities, how would you rate them? My complain is library is small compared to my previous uni. Dont have a study area thats 24/7 open with computer/wifi access for ppl who want to work at evening or late nights.


Do they provide transfer of credit for Diploma holders (because i've looked at the modules and they look similar to what i've done, including MPU subjects). Yes they do. Talk to a representative because there are some rules that is damn stupid that affected my credit transfer. I literally have to now study all subjects that i have done before in my degree.

As someone who's not a local in the area, where do ya'll stay at besides the dorms
for those who has stayed in dorms, how's your experience so far. Idk about this but there's a condo outside campus called angkasapuri or smthg like that.. Hi, former UCSI student here who just transferred overseas! Not a 3D Animation but I can address your general section. Facilities can range wildly from run-down to top-notch because we have a relatively new building that was opened last year, I'm betting most of your classes will take place in this new building as that's where the computer labs for design students are. There's a variety of accommodation beyond the dorms offered by the uni, ranging from apartments like Angkasa and Puncak Banyan to terrace houses. The latter can vary depending on the landlord's design, I stayed one that's renovated to fit 20 people in one house, 'twas really fucked up. I wished I'd have known that the uni and surrounds are quite hilly, so it takes a hike to go from one block to another, but hey, I lost 7 kg in a year from it!. thank you, i'll be sure to ask for more details regarding credit transfers; but that sucks though that you had to retake all those subjects (probably want money i guess) , but i guess at least you can chill a bit since you'd know the answers and techniques already 

Good luck on your studies!. That's good that they're expanding their land, seems it would be more convenient and to have different environment for each faculty. Also can imagine how much noise there is when you mentioned 20 people living under one roof, and being students to boot

 i've heard that UCSI's place is generally on hills so i assume everyone's calves are just steel, good for a daily workout i guess? other than that thanks for the info!",440.0,28,289,0

Screw you anti-vaxxer!!. Good news but I thought the anti vax mentality in Malaysia was shut down awhile ago? How big was the issue?. Oh my god finally. They'll just scream it's oppression against their human right, this is Big P agenda, yada yada yada.

All I have to say is, padan muka. Dulu nak cabar sangat, suruh kerajaan wajibkan imunisasi.. Alhamdulillah, hopefully the vaccine will enrich our mental mind too.. Thank you KKM.. It's weird to see that we actually need a bill to save lives, if it weren't for these anti-vaxxers then none of this would have been a problem.. Are we the first country to reach this evolution?. Inshallah. REVOLUTION,
INDEPENDENCE,
FREEDOM. From America I congratulate you lucky sons of b‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢hs.. Lol get fucked Jenny McCarthy. Great news. Ladies and gentlemen, we got em. Absobloodylutely !! Goood job KKM!!!. Now I only need to worry about the fucking flu right before exams. YES!!!!! hell yes!!!!. I've never met one, would like to meet one to debate.. Should introduce opt-out organ donation like Singapore. Quick (and probably a dumb one) question, what about those who are not vaccinated before the bill is passed? I mean it‚Äôd be nice to have them vaccinate those unvaccinated (probably grown up) kids too.. Ah, so the bill yet to be passed. They better do it soonest.. Anti-vaxxer: ""Kecek sike lo ni'. Very noice. Was anti-vaxing a problem here?. Inb4 someone uses R&R card to fight this.. This is good. Just slap them if they ever refuse vaccines for their kids. Thank god!  This will prevent more deaths for innocent children. And we know just how many that is :((. I hope the anti vaxxers would decide to stop having kids, we don't need their kids in this world given the way they would *potentially* raise them.. ...... and we may need medical squads to enforce this...... ""VACCINATE OR BE VACCINATED!""

Basically the idea is to vaccinate on the spot.. Now please enforeced no vac, no school for the next step. Every karen hate this. naisuuuu. Good job Malaysia. That's fucked up.. Anti vaxxer can still opt not to have kids!!!! Yay.... Now sit down, shut up, and take your Compliance.. And there I was hoping that natural selection will root out the dummies. Nope, guess morons will live to vote another day... how disappointing.. Antivax mom: I‚Äôm NEVER going to vaccinate my kid

How can natural selection take its course then?. If we have freedom to choose any religion, why not choose to say no to vaccine?. Vaccines wouldn‚Äôt survive on a free market, they are not good enough, bad products have to be forced.. Don't be too happy yet.. the bill still needs to be passed and they have to actually enforce it.. It's small but loud. You can check out Masyarakat Kena Tahu FB group to get a glimpse of their activities.. My sister work at an islamic (?) company and she knows at least more than 10  an anti vacc. My mother is against HPV vaccination and drugs for ADHD and related conditions but otherwise is fine with other medicines so I guess more widespread than you'd think.

Reminds me I need to get my HPV vaccination soon but it's not like I'm engaging in sexual relationships lmao. It is still pretty big. Majority came from extreme muslims group that rejects the usage of vaccines.. I remember my Biology teacher told that vaccination is bad  when I was form 4. Most of them were brainwashed by the local product seller so that people buy their product instead of vaccinating their children. >this is Big P agenda,

Jewish agenda*. Dasar Freemason!. Semua salah DAP. All that aluminum to get stuck in the brain, nice!. Very cool.. U need to. Anti Vax in Malaysia majority comes from the extreme Islamist group of people. It's easier to force them through law than correcting their 'kepercayaan'. No, Australia had No Jab No Pay ages ago..

I think there was report somewhere that stated 1 in 7 malaysians are anti-vaxxers. And the anti vaxxers are parents, the one who will caught the disease are the poor kids.. You've got to understand herd immunity. 

Babies and kids don't get to choose, their parents choose for them. So fuck them kids right?. It's not about them, it's about herd immunity..

Kids that are forced out of vaccination by parents are innocent though. And those parents were vaccinated so nature can do nothing bout them. Unless Sir monkey decided to take one for the team and assassinate them in their sleep.. Because when you are running around with infectious disease, you‚Äôre not just endangering yourself.

You can say no to vaccine, if you live in isolation.. Vaccines will survive in the open market, but unvaccinated people will not. 
It wouldn't really be a problem except innocent children (parents opted out or genuinely allergic to the vaccines) will suffer due to anti-vaxxers like you.. > they are not good enough

Yeah you‚Äôre vaccinated. And that‚Äôs the only reason why you‚Äôre here browsing reddit bruh.

They are not good enough?

Edit: op browses r/conspiracy and r/debatevaccines. I rest my case. You should have been dead by now you anti vax incel. Little did you know, free market itself isn't perfect.. Shit thank god I left FB years ago. That place is hub for misinformation. What's their reaction to this news?. It's because people like these are why old diseases are making a return. Haih cannot brain la dumb people like this.. How to go haji/umrah if you don't vaccinate?. I got a hippy-ish co-worker that is against vaccinating her kids, but got vaccinated herself, saying it _wasn't my choice back then, so I'm making the choice for my kids_.. Dude same like my parents until one of my siblings was diagnosed with bipolar. They are now really supportive on mental health. 
I guess some people just need to experience it to change. 
Sucks tho cuz there's a mentality of ""oh there's no such thing as mental health issues you just need god"" in our country . Thankfully awareness is getting better here.. F. my ex brand manager is also an antivaxer. UK educated but influenced by Jenny McCarthy. It‚Äôs not just the extreme muslim, also the upper class woke vegan community that brings the stupid idea after studying abroad.. *""vaksin ada babi!!! haramm!!!""*. iluminati agenda. Found one unvaccinated peep. Wtf. He‚Äôs not even Malaysian and how did he discover this post.. I think the aluminium got to you dy. Even the statement ""mak ko hijau"" spew more intelligence than this. Please don't breed. Make the world a better place. Wow check his profile out. He is an anti vax in and out. Lol. Enjoy your last few years man. Your mother is green and you were conceived easily out of wedlock. It's ok, Malaysians are part reptilian race, it will not affect us at all thanks to the Anunnaki genes.. Hope you die sooner. Found one!. 

Oh you‚Äôre such a meme. Well when you die I hope everyone makes fun of your death. Don't forget the ones who studied abroad and bring back those stupid ""VaCcInEs aRe DaNgErOuS"" crap to Malaysia.. Eh, we can always claim we're the first Muslim country to do so. #doneclaim. Lawak. Nah fuck you. Cant have freedom of speech if youre sick. Huh..well at least its getting noticed before a whole hala-balu about vaccines being bad..

Even saying ""vaccines being bad"" made me feel bad..ugh. Hmm after a full assessment, article says KKM is only making vaccinations mandatory for newborns. Which means if those kids grew up and decided they wanna continue their parents' legacy, who are most likely dead from polio or the plague or some shit; natural selection is still in effect. 

I take back my comment, I fully support that policy. I may have a moral compass, but mother nature does not discriminate.. If I'm vaccinated for Hepatitis and I somehow exchanged fluids with a Hepatitic pleb, I'm not getting Hepatited.. Danke mods. Eyy, warn me too if my stupid ass decide to do that too eh?. 1. I am not vaccinated

2. I have an immune system which is far superior to anything Big Pharma can provide.

3. If vaccines brought a net health benefit then the industry would perform studies to prove it, but so far they‚Äôve taken an anti-science approach, refusing to perform the necessary studies.. Yea, my parents are just against the drugs but seems to be fine with therapy after one of my siblings got a diagnosis for asperger's, anxiety and was suicidal.

As for me, somehow I'm doing well despite not going through any therapy for whatever undiagnosed conditions I may have (probably autism according to my parents) but I'm definitely an exception.. ..i need paracetamol after reading this... >  upper class woke vegan community that brings the stupid idea after studying abroad.

Yeah, no.... I think they are mostly some mediocre educated MMM-susceptible trash head getting sucked into anti-vaxx camp.. > upper class woke vegan community

Your average Malaysians studying abroad don‚Äôt hang with these people.

This culture/lifestyle is very very new as well.. not all vegans are like dat tho.... D4P agenda. Ilembuminati agenda. Probably using search post (anti-vax), sort new and found this.

Not a great idea for that dude posting comments here thou. La-*whack*. IT IS MY RIGHT TO GET SICK! MY BODY MY CHOICE! Btw, what do you guys think about assisted suicide if it ever suggested to be implemented. Hala Balu... : Widow‚Äôs Direction?. *Hullabaloo. Most likely than not, the anti vaxxer parents were probably already vaccinated when they were kids.. I hope you have gotten your booster shot.

But it's not just about you. What I meant about herd immunity is to protect those whose immunities are compromised, ie, HIV patients, chemo patients, and those who are legitimately allergic to vaccines.. Nope, there's still chance you'll catch it. That's the point of herd immunity.. Fuck off about your immune system. The reason why you're alive is herd immunity.  Since the majority of the population is immune to diseases like polio and measles, you're much less likely to get them unless you're directly infected. People who can't take vaccines did to allergies rely on people like us with immunity to survive. So by choosing not to tale vaccines you're actively endangering those who can't take them themselves.

In other words, you're a piece of shit.. And have anti-vax people provided any ‚Äúnecessary studies‚Äù?

> anti-science

Fucking IRONIC. >I have an immune system which is far superior to anything Big Pharma can provide.

Buddy, you don't understand a single thing about vaccination, do you?. Oh oh oh oh i caught one in the wild! Which sub do i post my screenshots to karma whore??. >2. I have an immune system which is far superior to anything Big Pharma can provide.

That's because you are vaccinated you dumb dumb. Please leave our sub alone and go troll somewhere else. I believe this user is not vaxxed there fore we should waste its last few years of survival being trolled.. Fuck off!!. No offense but I find it a bit odd if people are against the drug usage. People use panadol to relieve headaches. The principle is still the same in using pills to relief mental illness.

I do hope you and your family are doing well, I know the feeling, used to be suicidal and seeing my sibling go thru something worse. Really unpleasant but it's worth fighting through üí™üèΩ. There are also successful, educated people that think that they are smarter than doctors.. \> I think they are mostly some mediocre educated MMM-susceptible trash head

We need to eliminate this notion that mostly these kind of people become anti-vaxxers. Even smart people can believe in dumb shit. Remember the two time Nobel prize winning scientist who believed Vitamin C can cure cancer?. don't be too surprised, nowadays even lawyers get scammed by the most ridiculous con e.g. ""helo ini polis, masuk duit kat akaun nih. Jangan bagi tau orang ya..""

many of these ""upper middle class"" anti vaxers are usually those helicopter parents who believe in ""magnetic bracelets"" and ""water with more oxygen"". I mean, look at flat earth society...

George Carlin says it best  Lol, it‚Äôs not just mediocre educated. Gotta stop the stereotype u had in ur mind. Probably surprised to see how many highly educated and rich people being duped into this anti vaccine.. My bad, should have specify not all.. Damn. An account created specifically to spread anti-vax practices. Americans are really fucked up sometimes.. Thank you..i didnt know how to type it and scared i end up typing ""Halla Bulu"" and that sound wrong. My TDAP boosters are up in 6 years. Influeza shots every year and whatever the doc tells me to get during the annual checkup. Except if the doc tells me to eat leafy greens and all that. I only like the purple spinaches, also kangkung belacan but only if I have tom yam. Apart from that, it's business as usual in anti-herpe town.. I wonder why our herd immunity is protecting people like this. It seems that without vaccine he have a social issue.. None taken. That's my view on drugs as well. My parents are mostly worried of potential addiction since ADHD is treated with methampethamines if I'm not mistaken and that has its own reputation in Malaysia with ""ice"" and all.

But so far, doing alright I guess. I was suicidal at some point and crashed my motorcycle a while ago and really could've died so I'm still surprised I'm turning out relatively ok. But I guess my sibling isn't as lucky and guess I'm glad he's getting the help he needs.. I think the point the previous posters were making is that these aren't educated people. They hold qualifications, but are very poorly educated.... Sometimes?. Don't blame the americans, this mentality is an epidemic that's infecting all over the world.. Herd immunity is not just about you.

The vaccine might not work as well on some people (antibodies levels may not be as high or last as long) or some people might have medical conditions (allergies, conflicting medication, sicknesses that reduces the body‚Äôs capability to produce those antibodies, etc.) which makes vaccines ineffective for them personally.

It helps if most of the people around them are immune (a normal, healthy and vaccinated person like you), which stops them from catching the disease.. People like that just need to leave the herd and be exposed to people with diseases.. Always lol. And somehow they are the loudest.. What is it with this sub feeding trolls who are clearly joking. Aside from me already addressing this on another comment, your last paragraph clearly indicated that herd immunization is logarithmic. Works exponentially like a disease (and thank fuck it's cheap). The chain is unlikely to get broken. Also, **I addressed this on another comment**. I can't do jack about matters that'll pass into law. You wanna get serious about a serious topic?

* Most decisions are a BOD matter, at which point the quorum of directors matter more than shareholding.
* Some matters are a shareholding matter (including voting who becomes director).
* To get in a scenario where the minority shareholder can effectively ""control"" the company, you can tweak the voting threshold so that decisions need their vote too, for example 60% to pass instead of 51% to pass..

2. Crowing about how they will be like BMW of Asia
3. Crow and crow about starting EV cars with Lotus
4. Crow and crow about ""Lotus Handling"". Ya, you just bought the company, asked them to tweak the suspension a bit on a shitty low-powered car that doesn't make much difference. Like asking Usain Bolt to design a race shoe for a 1km casual jog.
5. Name cars ""lofty"" names like ""Gen 2"". More like Gen -3.2, a few generations behind other car makers. Uses shitty ""Campro"" engine that they also crowed about, the ""first Malaysian engine""

PHB is the 100% owner of Proton Edar and PONSB. PHB is owned by Geely (49.9%) and DRB (51.1%)

The Chairman of PHB is Dato' Sri Syed Faisal, while the CEO of PONSB is Li Chunrong.

Edit: spelling error. Do u know what proton runs under ?. 49.9. 

1. All manufacturer did the same thing. It is part of the advertisement while testing the car

2. The BMW story is a very old story

3. Proton no longer has the LOTUS Ride and Handling since the Iriz. The suprima was the last one to use them.

4. Developing ev with Lotus is soooo old story. They are developing a new ev with LG but all these changed after Geely takeover

5. CamPro is so old story as well. It is a bad engine. The best is the latest variant. A bit disappointed when Geely cancelled the Volcano project. Those engines are powerful but eerily quite and come with 20k service interval. 

6. There are some other contribution to the country e.g.: They managed to talk with the government to amp up the safety requirement in new cars etc.. Nope, but I think you buy a company's constitution from SSM and find out.. Hello there Proton apologist",512.0,15,1,0

84,Syed Saddiq : Sports facilities in Tanjung Piai to get RM4 million upgrade,dk51my,2019-10-19 15:14:59,notexthere,11,0.88,11.0,"Government handing out goodies to a constituency who is about to host a by-election. Good to see the PH government following the footsteps of the much-adored BN government in using bribes to win elections. 

But in all seriousness, screw this. It's been barely over a year since the GE and the PH government has already begun to show their true colours and stooping this low? Shame on the government and Syed Saddiq, as a self-proclaimed progressive, yet he's no different than the generic incompetent UMNO ministers. 

This bribery by our very own Sports Minister should be thoroughly investigated by the Elections Commission if they really are neutral. 

Disclaimer : This is not a personal attack on the government whatsoever. I am not aligned nor do I support any particular political party both government or opposition. I say what I think and this particular headline popped up on my phone.. >""We're just fulfilling his wishes, said Syed Saddiq.""

Ladies and gentleman this is how you milk the passing of a person to your favour. 

And RM4mil to *upgrade* 6 futsal courts and a football field?  If RM1mil is for the football field and RM3mil for 6 futsal courts, that is still RM500k per futsal court, for *upgrades*. Can anyone shed some light on how expensive a futsal court is?. No suprise. Gula2 for by election is expected lmao. $25,000 in America, so around RM100,000. Though it should be cheaper in Malaysia. 

A Futsal court is 10% the costs of a normal football field. So a football field will cost $250,000 or RM1,000,000. Again, should be cheaper in Malaysia.

So these must be some quality futsal courts or they might take into account other fees and costs.. What‚Äôs your source? you made all that up? Relevance of America?. Malaysia doesn‚Äôt have anything online so I used America 

My sources:

85,'Racist' - Saddiq raps Hew for calling Malays radical for supporting Uyghurs,dk413j,2019-10-19 13:51:35,notexthere,49,0.89,31.0,"Sidenote: This article's comment section is a solid proof why we need to combat China influence in local social media.

Some Chinese propagandist FB pages are spreading misinformations about world and bragging the ""greatness"" of China with posts and text-to-speech videos. And the worst, telling people that criticising CCP = anti-Chinese. Some even disguise as local FB pages to make them look more trustworthy. 

The effects are showed on that comment section. Their influence is very effective on local Chinese people because their fluent Mandarin.. holy shit what the fuck is that propaganda comic. Ain't a good sign. The CCP already have an in with the Malaysian Chinese community. This will make others think of them as sell outs and traitors. Can we send Hew to Tongsan?. I don‚Äôt understand why the fucker hew support China so much for fuck... fucking disgusting to see his fucking face.. he doesn‚Äôt represent the majority of educated Chinese in Malaysia.. That Hew is seriously retarded as fuck. I sympathize the Uighurs, but because I'm a Chinese it's OK. Fuck that.. Malay youths care about Palestinians more than Uighurs

I wanna bet 90% of the Youth don't even know the existence of ""Uighur"" people. Heck even if you ask around the chinese populace of Malaysia and ask if they know Áª¥ÂêæÂ∞îÊóè see if they know what you're talking about.

Edit: lol, judging by the replies let me clarify. This is not about downplaying numbers. My point being people in Malaysia dgaf about Uighurs. So the statement about ""radical"" Malays giving a damn about Uighur and hate China cannot be true.. Because western media all say ""China bad lock up MUSLIMS!!"", you all go AHHHHHH. Honestly I did too , then I find out about separatist movements, riots, doesn't mean I support this oppression, but the problem is not as simple (as China being pure evil AGAIN) as I thought.

But definitely not supporting this comic, I find it stupidly condescending and overbearing, Impian China for example is a recent phrase, even 5-10 years ago did we get any China TV shows in our IP or Satellite TV? Who even knew about this ""Chinese Dream"" (China's take on the American dream), most older gen don't even read anything except things related to 4D or local politics. Then a whole page of ""Evil Muslims"", suddenly from promoting 1B1R he want to argue with all Muslims about how they ignore their own problems. Stooopid, and he is a Doctor?! He very much deserves this condemnation from Saddiq and everyone.. > combat China influence

This is a global campaign. Not just USA, even mainstream media outlets in Australia and New Zealand are partly owned by China.. >And the worst, telling people that criticising CCP = anti-Chinese

Learning from Zionists the easy route.. No need to see the article's comment section, we already have some here.. chinese boomers smh. > The CCP already have an in with the Malaysian Chinese community. 

source?. we kindda already did. the government appointed him as a CEO of Malaysia-China Business Council allegedly as a reward for his sacrifice for being thrown under the bus after the infamous *melayu screw melayu* speech.. I'm worried man. China's media is putting out a lot of propaganda into the Malaysian Chinese community that follow a lot of Chinese influencers/actors/etc. and use stuff like the Chinese tiktok. A lot of pro-CCP stuff is being spread around there (this is according to my Chinese friends). I'm worried for the youth that don't really follow world news and just use social media to get their information. Hearing their favourite stars and seeing tiktoks that are always on China's side will surely influence a lot.. Contradictory to your statement, I see alot of people share the plight of Uighur on my FB wall. The ""radical"" are the loudest if u ask me, by posting it every single day. In fact, Im seeing less Palestinian and Rohingyas posts these days. Guess its seasonal.. Doesn't mean their lives matter less, they're still being prosecuted. China literally has concentration camps for these people. 

>Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.

>MLK. China has concentration camps. >Because western media all say ""China bad lock up MUSLIMS!!"", you all go AHHHHHH. 

No. The media does not very easily influence the liberal (of which there are many on this sub) stance on social justice. Myself and almost all of my peers support Palestinian refugees right to return, their rights to not be expelled and replaced with settlers, and the two state solution despite western media‚Äôs disproportionate pro Israel bias.

Separatism cannot be used to justify 
-mass incarceration, 
-forced alcohol/pork consumption, 
-forced abortions, 
-rapes, 
-banning people to speak their own language, -removing graveyards and other physical heritage to erase their history in order to change the narrative of the xinjiang province and who it ‚Äòbelongs‚Äô to
-mass exporting han chinese to the province to change the demographics (which is one of the definitions of ethnic cleansing and illegal under international law)

Also you failed to address why the separatist movement started in the first place.

And there is also the argument that perhaps xinjiang ought to be is own country or merged with another central Asian country. According to some historians ‚ÄòChina‚Äô as we know never had ‚Äòauthority‚Äô or ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô (lots of caveats here), rather it was simply inherited from a collapsed mongol empire.. [Here you go]( Another reason is that being sons of immigrants after the war, they have this sort of ancestral obligation to support their roots but they did not question nor hold China accountable for their past crimes.

Exactly how modern Mainlanders do it.. I don't see this China media putting propaganda into our community, can you point out some examples, because it sounds like total bullshit to me.

Why Malaysia, why you think we are important to them? Ethnic Chinese are in so many fucking countries, and why not spread propaganda to Taiwan, HK first? They spread it here because we are definitely more stupid? Stop making shit up.. Palestine is always for the ultra conservative but uighyur issue is getting the attention. Rohingya not so.. but dont simply accuse people dont know abt the uighyur, if anything people can condemnt but nothing can be done if our gov and so many other country cant do anything about china bcos they are afraid of the backlash.. Read the edit.. yeah?. > No. The media does not very easily influence the liberal (of which there are many on this sub) stance on social justice.

(Edited formatting....)
Completely disagree there, Israel Palestine we have different views in Malaysia and always has. I was pro-Israel too, I saw Palestine as terrorist because my news sources were all western Media. Media coverage is very lopsided regarding China too, even many here, some ethnic Chinese included, are anti-China, and focus just on the bad stuff.

Speaking of western media, I do see British news not pushing anti-China view point lately, maybe because of brexit, and they need the trade with China.

So you just said it about the Uighurs and you are right, but there is a history yes? And it is not just about ""China hates Muslims"", the oppression (note that word I am using) is not against Islam, it is something else, do you get my meaning of western mainstream media ""China bad"", ""China oppression of minority Muslims"" trend? And then some PAS member saying if Chinese become PM here, Malays will be like Uighurs, who is politically indoctrinating who here. Should China grant Uighurs sovereignty? Probably not, if Sabah Sarawak want independence from Malaysia, should it be granted? Fuck that, let's work together (and that does not mean to bleed them dry of oil money), more development and focus should be placed on those states as well.

Mahathir being the god-man that he is, should have said it's too complicated for him to talk about, instead of China big, we need China. India not big?? If Mahathir said what you said, that Xinjiang should NOT be part of China, I think China will issue a warning and demand a retraction and apology, the warning will be about a full Sino-Malaysian trade embargo, seriously nobody is that stupid as to want that to happen, China doesn't want it, neither do we, not Syed Saddig, not Mahathir, nobody. They have stuff to sell, and we have stuff to sell, and mutual need of stuff, for trade.. You're going to need to explain this to me better. Are you both saying these grassroots DAP members and Hew are how the CCP have an in with the Malaysian Chinese community?. In UCSI University, we get free copies of the paper China Daily (as in it's given to the university to display, not to the students). I doubt many students read it, but it's given out here anyway. 

But besides that, I'm not even talking about the propaganda being spread specifically to Malaysia lmao. I'm talking about through tiktok, Chinese media, actors, etc. Malaysians just happen to see these things. That's what I meant when I said the propaganda is being spread to us.. I think they did spread propaganda to Taiwan & HK. If you could read Chinese, Google Á¥ÖÂ™í. They are the media companies that are controlled by pro-unification/CCP parties in Taiwan and they deified ÈüìÂúãÁëú despite him boasting little credentials. For HK, most senior citizens are pro government/police because they are more prone to government propaganda and having less access of information.. Yes I see, understood. And let me tell you, you cannot help stupid people, because they are too stupid to care. Let me tell you another thing, China does not want any of us no matter how successful to apply for Chinese citizenship, they want nobody from anywhere to do that, the number is zero. Some people will love China and hate Malaysia, I've seen people love South Korea and want to immigrate there, some love Japan and want to move there, some love America, England Australia, you name it, because ""grass is greener on the other side"". You cannot help them, because you are in no position to grant them their stupid wish.. > Á¥ÖÂ™í

That is far too much of a rabbit hole for me to want to check. For HK, I'm not sure, my mom doesn't like the the protests from the start, I have informed her about why the protests is happening and what pro-democracy is about, it's not that I'm a lousy explainer, she just doesn't buy it. And when I saw the violence the protesters are doing, beating people up mob style, stabbing police, vandalism of public or private property, I started feeling angry and started referring to them as rioters also, the language they use is also detestable, and this coming from someone who swear a lot, because their swearing is coming from anger, hatred and a kind of arrogance.",1827.0,12,1,0

87,Sarawakian moving to KL next year: What should I expect?,dk37je,2019-10-19 12:37:25,"I've been living in Sarawak for my whole 28 years of life. Need to move to KL next year to search for better opportunities. The cultures in Sarawak and KL supposed to be different right, although not that much. All my life in Sarawak, I've *heard from other people* saying KL people are not really as kind and also bullying those who doesn't really adapt to their culture (for e.g. for the Chinese, not knowing how to speak Cantonese etc.). Not meaning to be offensive, but this is what I heard *lah*. Quite worry about me being unable to adapt to their social background/style. 

Anyone who have had their experience, mind sharing? Got experience any culture shock? How about your working condition? Would really appreciate it if it comes from fellow Borneans (Sabahan/Sarawakian). Thanks.",18,0.82,47.0,"Life here is simple.

1) No one gives a damn on what you do.
2) No bullying if you don't adapt to KL life (see rule 1).
3) Chinese here do speak Mandarin and Hokkien(in areas like Cheras).


Overall, life here is great. You just got to be aggressive and have the I don't give a fuck attitude (especially on the roads). 

P.S - Cheap booze and babi are plenty. Depend on what part of Sarawak you‚Äôre from, you should be prepared for the sheer scale of the place. I‚Äôm from Sarawak, and people there use ‚ÄòKL‚Äô interchangeably to refer to the entire Klang Valley area plus Kuala Lumpur. Learn to plan your commute, especially if you don‚Äôt have a car. If you get a job in Bukit Bintang, but rent in Puchong, it could take up to 1 and a half hours to travel by public transport.

People won‚Äôt bully you for not speaking cantonese or hokkien. Mandarin is fine. However, english and malay are more important to get by here. I only find myself using mandarin to order meals at hawker centers. I use malay with grabcar/taxi drivers or civil servants. For everything else, I use english.

Working conditions? Oooh boy. Prepare for a dog‚Äôs dog life. I can say for sure Sarawakians are more laid back when it comes to work. Of course, it depends on what line of work you are in. But if you are on the bottom rung of the ladder, you‚Äôre pretty much fodder. On the upside, there are certainly more things to do and see in KL. It‚Äôs way less boring than Sarawak. So in short, you can work hard and play hard.

Also beware of scammers. They are everywhere. And I mean EVERYWHERE!!! Beware of people approaching you on the street with sob stories and stupid little contests that you will somehow instantly win. Beware of easy money-making opportunities. Beware mlm sellers who promise you ‚Äòpassive income‚Äô for the rest of your life. 

And for the love of god, if a guy on a bike asks to borrow your phone for a minute for an emergency call, at least make sure he gets off the bike first. This is from first hand experience when I came to ‚ÄòKL‚Äô (Actually Subang) as a bright-eyed young hick boy from Sarawak. In fact, it‚Äôll be better if you don‚Äôt trust anything on a motorbike.

Edit: Unless, you know, if they are delivering your food. Be nice to them.. All the east Malaysian i know are really nice and warm people. Bangi is alright. But it‚Äôs more *Selangor* than KL.  
KL would be where you find Kepong, Jinjang, Sentul, Wangsa Maju, Titiwangsa, Mont Kiara, TTDI, KL CBD, Kerinchi, Taman Desa, Brickfields, Sri Petaling, Bukit Jalil and a small part of Ampang and Cheras. PJ and the rest are largely under Selangor. One way to find out is if your company is giving you a holiday on February 1st or not.  
  
If you‚Äôre driving, do not drive on the right lane if possible, and even on the left lane, getting tailgated is quite common, just don‚Äôt take it personally. Be mindful of motorcycles that come out of nowhere and drivers who beat the red lights. Most people are always in a rush here, but ironically people are always late at appointments.  
  
If you‚Äôre taking public transports, especially trains like MRT/LRT/Monorail/KTM, practice good habits:  
‚Ä¢ Stand on left side of the escalators so that people can move on the right side.  
‚Ä¢ When boarding a train, stand at the side of the door and allow people to exit trains first before you enter.  
‚Ä¢ Unstrap your backpack when taking trains because you can knock on people with your bag without you realizing it if you have it on your back.  
  
Basically, try to be mindful of people and surroundings as it‚Äôs a heavily populated metropolitan. Always assume that when someone unsolicitedly approaches you, it‚Äôs usually up to no good no matter how good it sounds. Just politely refuse.  
  
Things to eat/do around Bangi:  
‚Ä¢ Sate Hj.Samuri, Sate Willy, food trucks, uptown night market, tons of Malay food.  
‚Ä¢ IOI City Mall, big and crowded with cinema, bowling, ice-skating, musical fountain, extreme park, etc.  
‚Ä¢ SILK highway can lead you to Balakong/Cheras South where you can find Dataran Cheras and C180. It‚Äôs a commercial hubbub with a lot of restaurants and cafes. AEON Cheras Selatan is there too.   
‚Ä¢ Visit Semenyih for Broga Hill hiking, Semenyih Fish Village, and some good food outlets as well. Tien Tien Lai and Leng Leng are both good pork noodle outlets.  
‚Ä¢ MRT from Kajang can lead you to many interesting spots in downtown and Damansara as well. KTM can bring you directly to Mid Valley, and even Sunway Pyramid if you don‚Äôt mind the transiting. Oh it can also head all the way to Klang, where you‚Äôre just a Grab ride away from the famous Bak Kut Teh restaurants.  
  
Enjoy your time here.. Kl is a melting pot of ppl from all over msia...no one will care where you are from.. If they said about KL people are not kind, they got that half correct. I don't blame any of them or any of us who lives in KL to be all yay sunshine helpful. It is a fast pace living and work place, and it is not as relaxing as say...people stopping at Kuching roundabout to give stare at each other on who should go first.

No throwing bottles culture in semenanjung during festival. It's fun somewhat, but public or roadside drinking is a bit frowned upon.

Do not attempt on loghats if you are unsure, but people will not laugh at you for wanting to learn.

Workplace: be firm, but friendly. Mindgames while it is good, do not work in most workplaces. Won't work on me either. Lol...

Sending items back home can be a pain due to the extra charges, but at least your items from oversea won't get detained as fast as the ones in S'wak.

Do not take heed with people who mocks you with bila sampai malaysia. It is funny (as per their claim), but I wish those close minded people will not step foot in Borneo. Ever.

15minutes is not that far in Semenanjung as compared to Kuching and well connected towns in Sarawak. When people said ""dekat"", and you are in major towns and it is office hour or daytime, expect at least 30mins to one hour.

Belajar makan pedas, if you haven't. So many yummilicious foods that can be a bit overwhelming to Sarawakian. 

Do not..and I say do not, be rude to mamak or anyone that serves you food, or you'll get a surprise from them in your food. And no, they won't tell you. But do not over kipas also. Not all mamaks like it.

Know your rights as a customer, as worker, as Borneo residents, as well as being Malaysian.

Bring on the stickers, you are allowed to.

Bring on the Q plate number, it is super easy to register it here.

Bring your passports along, or you will have hard time to renew it due to some weird ass rule. On mobile now, can't search for it.

All the best, and don't forget to join r/malaysia reddit meetup next year! :). typical S&S, coming to our city, eatin our food, takin our jerbs, getting our wahmen! /s

Nah for real though just be chill and you'll be fine. Shit's more expensive tho. As someone similar like you, you will find casual racism around. It is just the acceptable norm here. You will see a clear segregation between races. U need to speak more mandarin/cantonese compared to hokkien. I assume you are from Kuching. Food tasted different but most are good as back home like the chap fan. You‚Äôll get lonely if you don‚Äôt join any social groups like in sports or gaming or any other hobbies. People need to plan far ahead because it is not a 5 minutes drive everywhere like back home. Have a plan B for everything, your dependencies on Plan A will give you eternal stress while living there. Booze are expensive but you will find a shop that will sell cheap like back home. Ask the Indians. Indians are cool and don‚Äôt call them thamby, call them macha instead. Be frugal with money, stay away from those gambling dens or brothels. Make friends fast although city people are a bit superficial but you will find someone or a group to hang out.. Can't compare since I've never worked in sarawak but there was no culture shock when I came over so I'd be surprised if you felt any. 

I can say the races are a bit more cliquish but that means you can join multiple groups if you want to. I don't feel like people are excluded as much as they gravitate to each other vs my time in sarawak where you mix with everyone.. Sarawakian here. Been here for a few years and so far it's been pretty good. Moving around here is pretty easy and convenient due to the far better public transportation system. 

Do mind your spending though. Cuz depending on your area later on, some of the food prices can be really expensive. If you're considering driving here, don't forget to get a TNG card to pay for the toll. 

Language wise, it will take some time for you to pick up Western Malaysia's Malay accent. Don't mind if people start to talk Malay in a weird tone to you. (Most people try to talk Malay to me like I'm from Indonesia here for the first few months I was here). But if you're still uncomfortable due to your accent, you can just speak English.. I moved here from Sabah when I was 17, life is a bit more fast-paced but you're going to do fine.
Stay alert, (1) make friends and enjoy.

Ps careful, in KL, the money is flowing.... the wrong way!
(2) Track your expenses.. Yesterday was Lan Berambeh where Sarawakian workers and students in Peninsula gather with exhibitions, dinner and talk with the Chief Minister. Try go there next year.. Some words are used differently here. Pantat in KL refers to vagina. Wtf?

I sat too long once and i commented ""shet, pantat sakit man."" Im a guy.. Non Cantonese speaker that speak Canto just sounds like mainland cina tryna' speak Canto in HK. 

Shit is funny.. Expect...... Jam. Please dont bring sarawak for sarawakians car stickers. It's really ironically pathetic to have, especially in semenanjung.. > Cheap booze

where... they are really expensive tho.. i get long bois in Thailand for less than half of whatever i get in Malaysia. Aggressive & IDGAF attitude on road is true. Wonder is that why I heard road accidents every morning when following Astro Radio Traffic.. I relate to your answer the most. Ya, I should not use the term 'KL', should be more specific instead. I'm at the Bangi area actually. 

That's what I'm worry about too. The jam.. What if in the middle of the journey, I need to do business #1/#2?? not to mention other types of emergency. Very worrying.

Working condition is really very relax in Sarawak. Almost like retiring lifestyle here. I'm thinking to retire in Sarawak once I've done with my working age/years. I'm in software development field, but my skills are not that good.  
Prepare for a dog‚Äôs dog life? Does this mean it's a very hard work? I should expect this, providing I can get much higher salary than I can get in Sarawak.

I've heard some horror stories through news portal. Will definitely be careful. Oh my, I've never been interested in MLM. It's the worst scheme ever.

Sure, be kind to food delivery dudes.. Thank you. But still rambut sama hitam,hati lain-lain. Not all :(   
You've met with good East Malaysian, that's good.. Puchong is considered Selangor as well?. Sure. Reddit meetup - sounds like a good idea. Well, considering that I'm starting fresh and no friends.   
Pedas - see if my stomach can tolerate it or not, haha.. I don't think us Sarawakian have any accent when it comes to BM right? I only speak bahasa baku. I noticed their BM is slightly pronounced differently. For e.g. Saya - ""Sa yer"" etc.. >I sat too long once and i commented ""shet, pantat sakit man."" Im a guy.


Bughit, you mean?

Palak bughit palak bughit mantra you chant whenever you feel like pooping but no nearby toilets around.

Pantat in s'wak means ""doing it"", compared to vagina in the peninsular.. Depends eh. Like me, I'm not a native Canto speaker, but my Canto is TVB standard. As I don't speak Canto on a regular basis, mostly is never because it's not the main dialect in Sarawak, so I need some time to think then say it in Canto, slowly. If a Canto speaker come to Sarawak we'll never look down on them *pun*, although they can't speak Foochow or Hokkien. There lies our difference between Canto speakers and us, at least we are not that arrogant.. relak lah bro. Freedom of speech bij. Those kedai kedai if you know what I'm talking about. Oh it's normal. You see it everywhere. I've literally never met a bad east Malaysian even once in my life. You guys are all so nice wtf.. Yes. I'm not sure how to explain it but I guess it's their tone and how they pronounce stuff that's different from the people in Sarawak.. No worries. I get laughed at when I speak Mandarin or Hokkien. FYI, I don't learn Mandarin in school and apparently, my Hokkien is southern dialect, not their northern Hokkien (Penang).

I wouldn't say they are arrogant, more like they are surprised that I'm trying something out of comfort zone. Therefore, it's funny.

There lies our difference. You are afraid to be made fun of, therefore you don't try or avoid, and thus this post to reaffirm your own ill founded POV.

Just chillax it, you worry too much.. no i don't?

The only ""cheap"" one i know is Jalan Alor there got this one Indian ""bar"" selling canned and bottled crap from India. They are nasty.. I think it's because of the environment that we grew up in. I don't know about other S&S but my family, we just live the days peacefully, not really bother about racism/religion issue. There is some really low-key racism but not as terrible as the peninsular. We can open stalls next to each other in a shop. Also, there's no much emphasis on materialism. Sarawakians are more *cincailah* in that sense. Also much relax and simple(naive a bit).

P.S: Probably unrelated, but my childhood playmate is a Malay, my bestfriend in my secondary school is a Malay (sekolah kebangsaan). So, I don't get to be influenced by anyone to make friends from different races.. What do you mean my ill founded POV? I don't mean you as arrogant. I mean them. I think I misunderstood your 'funny' definition. No one really speaks Canto in Sarawak, so no one to practise with. I'm open to speaking it lah, after all, why not. This is one of the way to blend in with the crowd if majority of them are speaking Canto. Just like me speaking Malay, if majority audience are Malays.

Oh, and please use your own line when reply to me, no need to steal my line~. Where do u live though? I‚Äôll try to think of a place close to you. But kingfisher beer quite yummy wo.. 
Hello? You wrote this?

>There lies our difference between Canto speakers and us, at least we are not that arrogant.

Of course I'm gonna think you meant all canto speakers are arrogant, including me.

Oh, and I get so many ppl, including Sarawakians questioning my chinese identity. Like I'm some sort of traitor to the Chinese culture and language by those ""arrogant cinas"". Sarawakians ain't angels k, just saying.

And I like stealing lines and you ain't doing nuffin'

edit-

 This hapened is in a foreign country. A Sarawakian girl I know, asked me probably 5 - 7 questions in a span of 2 days, why I don't speak Mandarin, why can't I speak Mandarin, why I should speak Mandarin, etc. 

Funniest shit is she always intro herself as Chinese and a lot of foreigners initially thought she is a Chinese national, she had to explain later why she is both Chinese and Malaysian at the same time.

For her, Chinese > Malaysian. If that is not arrogant, I don't know what is.. Around Bandar Utama. > kingfisher 

> yummy

Some are ultra-Chinese, some are ultra-Malay, we can only tolerate them. Most important is teaching the next generation not to think the way the Ultras do irregardless of any race and ethnicity.. Take the LDP south towards kelana jaya. Exit at the western digital junction or the next one. Go to ss3/37. There is a shop called Shiraz. Prices are pretty good and selection is quite decent. I‚Äôve been buying from them for about a decade now. Never gotten a fake but some regulars have complained they sometimes they get one. Also do check out the store a couple of doors away, kedai ubat cina something. Much larger wine selection but they do have the other stuff as well.. you know any place that serves cheap draught?

Thanks for the recommendation. There‚Äôs a place called Richfield corner not a minute away from from those shops. Tiger draughts are 14 per glass without the need to purchase a package. They have Heineken, Kilkenny, and Guinness as well but they‚Äôre cheaper by the package. There‚Äôs also apple fox cider on tap but I don‚Äôt know the price.. Glass, I take that these are malaysian pints? Like 300+ ml?. Yup. The glass mugs we see everywhere. Not that super tiny glass that they commonly give with the towers.",3081.0,10,134,0
88,Obivious propaganda by CCP for Malaysians,dk308o,2019-10-19 12:17:33,notexthere,102,0.94,116.0,"Malaysian Chinese here and I am very terrified of the Communist Party of China. Please use CCP or China when refer to them, there are other Chinese around the world that is opposing them, Hong Kong protests still going hot. There are distrust issues between races in Malaysia but compare to others around the world I think we are doing pretty well relatively, and I certainly think it can get better.  


China's influences had been here since our previous corrupted government, it is a concerning issue that our current government have to solve, and Dr. Mahathir seems to be wary of it.  


Also, I was from SMJK school, our study of Chinese was about language usage only, we don't learn about history of China in textbook, all I can remember now are some idioms from old dynasties or something that have nothing to do with current China. I mean, our Sejarah refer to communists as terrorists (make that into our law please?), I can definitely relate to that more than I previously was as I learned more about them...  


For older generations of Chinese, there are indeed more that blindly like China, but for younger generation that have excess to real internet instead of just Facebook or Wechat, there are definitely more that are wary of it, especially since Hong Kong protests happen and all the horrifying news like the Uyghur concentration camp, those definitely opened my eyes. People do require some efforts to do some researches on internet to find out about Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution and Tiananmen Square Massacre to realize how dangerous the CCP are.  


Anyway, all those terrible news around the world makes me realize that our country is truly a blessed and peaceful place to live it. I love Malaysia and I definitely don't want CCP influences here.. Wtf is our government doing to allow such Chinese propaganda to be published here?

Holy shit why are we getting cozier with China after the change in government?. Superman Hew should rename himself superbootlicker Hew. Smells of treason. Never liked that Hew. Should have kick him off DAP.. needs some Winnie the pooh. Quote from comic:

> **Golongan generasi tua kaum Cina yang mempunyai latar belakang pendidikan Cina lebih memahami ""Impian China""**

Doesn't this confirm what the dissenters of Chinese education say? About how Chinese education try to instil love for China? Wouldn't that make them less patriotic for Malaysia?

But it specifically said older generation. Why? Current Chinese education has been revised? Or newer generation prefer Taiwan over China?. The comic is talking about the belt and road initiative. Which is perfectly fine. But I don't know why it has to go off-tangent and talk about how many percentage of Malays are supporting IS, or attempt to justify what China is doing to the Uighurs or promote China socialism. All those things have absolutely nothing to do with the initiative, and could be easily be left out. This Superman Hew is an idiot. I‚Äôm a bit out of the loop here, who‚Äôs this Superman Hew guy everyone keeps talking about in the comments?. What in the fuck. The author should portray how the Uighur Muslims are treated in the concentration camps.. Belt and Road Initiative is China's global military domination disguised as economic initiative to help poor countries in the world. Socialist ideas in the Western world is ripe for plucking and China wants to be the first one to take advantage of this. Apart from US, there is no other countries that can stand against China and Trump is slowly stopping US  from being the world Police (too expensive). The UN is useless, just admitted Venezuela  as member of UNHRC. EU is losing it's power thanks to their stupid immigration policy and the Islamic countries just can't stop fighting each other. And poor Malaysia have no choice to appoint a 94 yo PM who cowered to China. He dare not even speak up against CCP's treatment of their Uyghur Muslim for fear of China withdrawing it's money.. Is there any link for the full comic?. Where did you get the comic book?. This is actually quite cool. 

When did reddit put this feature to show numerous images from imgur as slideshow?. Don't you mean oblivious?. This guy should balik China if he loves China so much along with DAP members that sponsors him.. created by that racist superman hew and also orchestrated that um protest. the kid is a disciple of hew. This is from the same guy who believes the south chjna sea belongs to china. Might as well say melaka belongs to chjna since they paid tithes to the emperor.. Cina who hates Hew‚Äôs inflammatory speeches reporting in. I hope he gets removed from his position of power. Reminds me of the similar stunt that BN pulls with Superman Najib before. Protekkkkk incoming.. Morons overreacting like usual. Some even saying they are so terrified of CCP.

If this is propaganda, what about all those Western propaganda you have been feeding yourself with? How many Hollywood movies paint US and its western allies as the good guys? You think these people actually fight for world peace and human rights? What gives them the right to invade country after country? 

Even movies like Marvel has most of the main characters being Americans. These are all propaganda but you are paying to watch them in cinema. 

We have UK colonizing us and you still have people here worshiping white people like they are superior beings.. 

Your concerns reflected perfectly in this article. Chinese Malaysians (and overseas Chinese of other countries for that matter) should open up their eyes and stop being CCP's useful idiot. Remember this: All Chinese Malaysians are first and foremost Malaysians.. This so much lol. Meleis online think SJK(C) teaches communist ideologies.

Fuck most Chinese don‚Äôt even know the history of China without external research.. New Super Bootlicker 64 XL: Hew Edition. technically he is not DAP.. He already resigned.... that was YEARS ago.. Do you want to suddenly ""disappear""? üòú. Older generation and the original MCA actually has its roots in the Kuomintang party, that which rules over Taiwan. It is only more recently that MCA and BN decides to go buddy up with the CCP. Ya'll can laugh but this one of the main points that make Malays suspicious of Chinese, mainland or otherwise. Uighurs are in concentration camps, will the Chinese here do the same to Malays?. It doesn't matter, the damage has already been done. Now people have legitimate reason to distrust chinese education.. My mom doesn't know jack about Impian China, and she is not a communist. You think Chinese education in Malaysia have been secretly indoctrinating children into communism, or promoting Chinese propaganda until recently? When you study English, what works do you study, the literature author from where? When people study Chinese language, what do you think people study? Literature from respected writers throughout history lah, and where you think to these famous figures are from? ... But is a famous writer Chairman Mao? Ahh haha I let you guess. Answer hint: No.. The comic is not about belt and road. But Hew's agenda. He tried to shove his agenda into the youths' mind. No surprise from a CCP bootlicker.. > But I don't know why it has to go off-tangent and talk about how many percentage of Malays are supporting IS, or attempt to justify what China is doing to the Uighurs or promote China socialism.

Chinese Propaganda.. Belt and road I initiative is not ""perfectly fine"", it's neocolonialism.. Yeah me too. No idea who this Superman Hew guy is. Malaysian Chinese version of Jamal Yunos. []( Nonsense it is not a concentration camp it is a re-education school where the Uighur could learn about the glorious CCP culture that span from 5000 years ago.. > EU is losing it's power thanks to their stupid immigration policy 

Explain please.. Trump is finished. And I am frankly surprised people still use the tired old rhetoric of ""failed"" immigration policy of Europe, sth the right wing media seems to have an obsession of. Europe is fine. The immigration issue is hugely overblown. It doesn't affect the life of a citizen not one bit.   


If anything, europe is slowly gaining relevance on global politics. The biggest failure in europe right now is none other than brexit.. I think it's been in here since a long time already.. upload to imgur as an album. obvious*. Nah man it's Oblivion.. How did hew even get involved with only a student holding a card in a graduation event?. I've seen people saying this as well, any sources though?. Why does all these new accounts think that r/malaysia is lowyat??? There is only a handful of hardcore DAP supporters and even those accounts are mostly gone soon after GE, and no one here likes Superman Hew either.... Many chinese redditors are banana and can't even read chinese.. Maybe try facebook or something otherwise you're just wasting your time.. What for??. Yet so many still advocate for China‚Äôs influence in Malaysia and many more said the Hong Kong protesters are an ungrateful lot etc. There are many who are brainwashed and want to be part of the ‚Äúgreat‚Äù motherland. These people should have their citizenships revoked. They don‚Äôt know how good we have it here. Not saying that Malaysia is perfect by any means, but we‚Äôre far better off than in China.. Thats why i propose we call ourselves as malaysian chinese.. Forget smjkc teachers I've seen people in Malay Twitter claim Lee kuan yew was a commie LOL. And DAP are still using him as political tool. 

Pathetic!!. Tru dat, I know many teachers in the 60s were even KMT sympathisers

The headmaster of my sch back then was relatively famous for pushing to be the 1st vernacular high sch to join the national system, got shot to death by a CCP-supporter. Hahaha polis military all Malay dominated and the percentage of minorities keep shrinking, dont worry about any revolution or oppression from chinese/indians. Only one group in Malaysia runs a ""re-education"" camp where they can detain you indefinitely and it ain't run by nons.. ""do the same to malays"" lol id like to see them try, theyd be dead before they have a chance to regret it. You think all Chinese fucking think the same is it? All of them are communists who dgaf about human rights? Chinese are not like Malays who are forced to believe in one religion ok. Stop project your own worldview onto others to justify whatever.

What is the population of Chinese in Malaysia? How can they possibly put Malays in concentration camps?. I get where you are coming from, but i would like to point out that anything can be politicised. Confucious Institutes are one example of CCP propaganda in the name of Chinese learning.

Summary: everyone should keep their eyes open, think critically and openly question anything felt slightly wrong.. But then bulat2 translate to malay for whatever reason üòÇ

I agree with you, but I can't help to see the irony in that.. Your statement shows you don't read beyond MSM.. >  Europe is fine. The immigration issue is hugely overblown. It doesn't affect the life of a citizen not one bit.

Translation: I wasn't personally affected by immigration so it's ok. I didn't die from Islamic terrorist attacks and I wasn't a victim of sexual assaults so it's completely fine over here.. Oh yeah I'm sorry it should be  'obvious'. Take a look at his post history to join the dotted lines.. That kid is groomed nonetheless, I mean that kid have no bloody business being there during najib tour and TBH, neither does he had any solid reason to protest during convo, go on and read the script from UM VC speech during kongres maruah melayu, you won't find any Chinese Indian hating word, just word to remind Malay to empower themselves.. the student actually have protest a few times before. remember one time najib do his usual ""lepak bersama rakyat"" thing in front of UM and there are protestor being attack by najib fanboys. that student was him. im not accusing the kid is hew disciple but i would not believe if people say they do not know each other prior to this. 

  [Here's a few pages]( We should stop them from advocating CCP, fuck the CCP. These are some of the first generation Malaysian Chinese that is still fondly remember their time back in China, along with some of their second generation.

I know at least one Malaysian Chinese still believes religions still exist **freely** in China.. Strictly speaking should be Chinese Malaysians, like African Americans, not American Africans. Chinese is the adjective, malaysian is the noun. Like a clever Malaysian, a patriotic Malaysian, a Chinese Malaysian.. OOTL?

Referring to the protest?. Well, they do have camp for muslims that are not good enough.. I think it's likelier for the opposite to happen given the anti-Chinese sentiment held by Malays. Chill the fuk out cina here so busy we got no time to get wet dreams about 5/13 round 2 like u. I don't think he is agreeing to it, but rather just pointing out the fear and ignorance at hand. That's the reason why some of these malay folks are so afraid of chinese taking over malaysia when in reality only 5 out of 28 ministers are chinese (LGE, Loke, Teresa, Liew & Yeo) and even those have to kowtow to DRM. It's the same mentality that led to the belief of muslim = terrorist

If we're talking about ""concentration camps"", the malays are already doing that to themselves via Shia re-education camps.. No, but it's certainly is convenient to think of the chinese as one giant monolith, since they number 1,3 billion at least, the largest demographics on this planet. The existence of bamboo network, and guanxi, makes it even prudent to be suspicious of their intent. With the recent education fiasco, the situation is strained at best. Now people will have a perceived legitimate reason to distrust it.  


It's not just in Malaysia. I lived in Europe for a long time. Distrust of chinese isn't sth new. It's everywhere (Australia especially). It's just that Malaysia is less subtle when it comes to xenophobia.  


And it's not like we can differentiate a chinaman and and an ah beng from perak, unless the ah beng speaks malay. When I lived in europe for a long time, almost every chinese and indian malaysian I met made a point of speaking bahasa melayu, just so that I don't confuse them with tanah besar people. Now imagine in malaysia, people even question the value of BM.

My point is, it's up to the chinese to decide how we treat them.. It‚Äôs good to think critically on most things in politics or life tbh. Think about it man, but stop before over complicating it, or for it to become a personal fantasy of evil aliens for amusement. When you study a works for learning the language, you are reading the expression of that author, it puts that author's origin place on your radar of things you carry around with you throughout your life. Put it simply, if you see a piece of news about China, and someone from SJKC see that same news, he may care more about it than you, to you China is just that big country and you aren't familiar with it, or maybe it's that evil communist country, but to former SJKC person, it's China, the source of the language, many thinkers and authors and many cool things.

So difference is, all you see is komunis komunis KOMUNIS!!! SJKC students see the roots of their culture and where their people came from.. [removed]. [removed]. nah, man. The jab was at how much of an oblivious idiot the artist has to be to think it'd be viewed positively..  Hmm. My china supplier is a christian. He is quite open about it and can discuss about his believe out in open. Maybe i have misunderstood what you are trying to say, but how do you know that religious doesnt exist freely in china?. Im not good with grammar, but adjective can be used before or after a noun, correct? So chinese malaysian and malaysian chinese are both correct gramatically. Its the intention of how you want to use those words. i believe in power of words. Saying chinese malaysian, eventhough its gramatically correct, will (however slight) make us prioritise cultural identity more than our nationality. 

That is why many facebook chinese are so gungho in supporting ccp in hk vs china. Cultural identity is more important to them than geographical/nationality identity. That is why malay and chinese are still at each other's throat after so many years of independence and living together. That is why some malay still associate us with china and link us with communism eventhough almost all of malaysian chinese are not in supporting of communism.. [This Hew 'Superman' guy is a loose cannon. Yet DAP grassroot still support him.](

""Seramai 43 pemimpin akar umbi, termasuk beberapa Adun DAP membantah  pengumuman Menteri Pendidikan Dr Maszlee Malik untuk melarang pengedaran  komik 'Inisiatif Jalur dan Laluan (BRI)' daripada memasuki sekolah."". but yall got time to make a propaganda comic that promot racism and communism? yare yare retard. He's giving legitimacy to that fear and ignorance and that's honestly fucking bullshit. What is his goal? To have the Chinese in Malaysia end up in camps? Because that's more likely to happen than his ludicrous claim.

And how the hell are the Chinese minority in Malaysia going to put the Malay majority into concentration camps? Nobody is answering this question because the statement is a ridiculous claim. u/MrKitteh You shit out that statement, how about giving us your answer?

>If we're talking about ""concentration camps"", the malays are already doing that to themselves via Shia re-education camps.

So Malays are actually the ones literally putting people into camps in Malaysia, the deviants of Islam (like dissidents in Communist China), because they believe all Malays must think the same and follow the official acceptable school of Islam. 

Then this clown projects the beliefs (all people of a race must think the same) and actions (putting dissidents in camps) of his own people onto Malaysian Chinese and claim that is what the Chinese here will do to them. Just fucking amazing.. >And it's not like we can differentiate a chinaman and and an ah beng from perak, unless the ah beng speaks malay.

Actually we can. No need speak Malay. The ah beng will speak with lah, meh, woh at the end of every sentence and have a mix of Malay, English, dialects in his speech. ;). That's great pal. How does the Westernized Chinese who can't speak Chinese or the assimilated Kelantan Chinese (which Malays like to bring up as model Malaysian Chinese citizens) fit into this? Are they members of the bamboo network and guanxi (had to Google that) as well? Why are you defending generalizations of an entire race?

Isn't the EU fostering greater economic relations with China now that the US has dumped them? I don't know how much distrust there is for the Chinese there but I would think the greater thorn in society would be the Muslims given all the security risks and social problems they're causing in Europe.

Australia is located too close to the East and I believe they screwed up with immigration and the assimilation (or integration) of new immigrants. Canada as well, they basically allowed rich Chinese to buy up property and cause a housing bubble. Kinda like pulling a Malaysia and selling out the country to the Chinese in a way.

In regards to the value of BM in Malaysia, the problem is people can exist and live their whole lives not knowing a word of BM. They will not die of starvation or whatever. As such the value of BM to them is literally little to none. Personally I believe in assimilation especially when it comes to language and every Malaysian should be able to speak BM. Part of the solution is to just force close all vernacular schools and provide Mandarin and Tamil classes in Sekolah Kabangsaan (to keep with the multiracial ideal of Malaysia). It's completely counterproductive to building national unity by having different schools in different native languages of your citizens. That is what I believe in. That would not completely solve it however. People will still naturally self segregate in any diverse society. The ultimate solution to making BM a valuable language is for Malays to be capitalists and take control of the economy without any tongkat. Once you control the economy people will naturally have to follow your rules. When people immigrate to America they need to speak English to get a job, to survive. The same situation needs to happen in Malaysia for BM to be seen as valuable. Now can that happen? I highly doubt it. If you disagree with this method and perhaps think Indonesian style forced assimilation is the solution, that didn't stop the Chinese from being persecuted despite speaking Bahasa Indonesia.

>My point is, it's up to the chinese to decide how we treat them.

That's cute. Already a discriminated minority in this country and it's still up to the Chinese to decide how we (Malays) treat them. I want you to reread that.

You know, it's funny because I have the same exact sentiments for Muslims. They keep committing terrorism, discriminating against the kafir and imposing their religion upon others. One day shit is gonna hit the fan. I hope the West wakes up soon.

Honestly dude it's sounds like you're presenting the Jewish Question. That the Chinese is this problematic race without taking into account the Malay's Islamic culture that is very hard to assimilate into and also supremacist in nature. It's like you're blaming dhimmis for their own dhimmitude.. 

Read the above article and i hope you will realize what i mean. If you just blindly go into class learning the beautiful Chinese language and culture, you may end up being a ""useful idiot"" of the CCP whom the CCP will use to undermine Malaysia and her interests. 

>SJKC students see the roots of their culture and where their people came from

According to the article, This is exactly how the CCP politicise issues. They emphasize that overseas Chinese have their roots in China so must work for the ""greater good"" of China.  Not saying Chinese Malaysians have to ditch their links to China, but they have to think critically what they have been told in class. Chinese Malaysians are Malaysians first and foremost and their loyalty must without question be on Malaysia's side. Malaysia is their motherland, not China.. [removed]. [removed]. You can believe in any religion in China. Either do it quietly or subscribe to CCP's registered religions. The only caution is just don't attract CCP's paranoia.

Previously CCP purged Falun Gong, which isn't even a religion. Curently, Uighur's being their new target.. DAP may not be a race based party but damn bro they sure got a Chinese bias.

Which is why we should all support PKR.. This is like the true face of DAP.. As far as I know WE had nothing to do with this, it‚Äôs 1 retard who happened to be Chinese that decided it was cool to slip in some CCP kool-aid in a comic 

Same like how my comment said ‚ÄúU‚Äù and not ‚ÄúU Malays‚Äù - cause I‚Äôm sure not all of them are as stupid as u. > ridiculous claim.

glad you notice. Go to any far right malay nationalist facebook groups and have a look see at the comments. From claims that Teresa Kok is a direct descendent of Chin Peng to this 

I think you're barking up the wrong tree or reading his comments out of context, the dude is just a regular redditor.. Broken malay is still malay, as in Phua Chu Kang, who is most definitely not a tanah besar person.. You are just extrapolating and exagerrating my point to paint it all as the jewish question. That's a huge leap.

I'm speaking of how people generally view the chinese, regardless as to where they're from. And the reason for that is none other than the rise of china itself. People don't make distinction of what sort of chinese you are, unless you tell them, but so long as you look chinese, they will assume you are chinese. Whether you are malaysian, singaporean or whatever chinese is irrelevant. Unless you tell them of course. For most people, it seems good enough to know that you are an ethnic chinese.

In europe, though we have a healthy trade relationship with China, they are seen primarily as a competitor nation. Access to their market is very much limited and the weak IP protection legal framework for foreign companies is still a thorn on our side. In fact, the PRC government actively promotes the theft of western IPs. But despite this, we do business with them anyway. It's all part of calculated losses. A loss that we can afford, for now.

I don't live in Malaysia, so I can't comment on that. But judging from how integration works in this part of the world, there is a tendency to assimilate to the greater culture. So regardless of what kind of minority you are, you follow the conventional culture. Over here, how you decide to act is very much how the world around you decide to treat you. If you live in ethnic enclaves, don't speak the language, promote parallel culture, then you are pretty much unwanted. And nothing is worse than being an unwanted foreigner.

How the muslims live in europe, is very much akin to how generally chinese malaysians live in malaysia. Are they ""problematic""? That depends on the country in question. Some countries demand stricter integration, others are more laissez-faire. And that's not my call. I can only discuss from experience.

And what people like you don't get is, europeans aren't generally anti-muslim. But they are pretty much anti-islam. Or any other ""foreign"" culture or ideas. But that's a problem they can solve easily. As the younger generation grow up, educated and become secularised, they will generally be inclined to identify with their national culture rather than their ""parent"" culture, so you have kurds and bosnians and poles who consider themselves culturally ""german"" for example.

And it works because europeans have a huge cultural power, something that people like you won't understand. It's pretty easy to paint all muslims as potential terrorists, and I am as anti-Islam as the next person can be, but blind prejudice is stupid.

In one or two generations, there prob won't be any muslims left in europe (except UK maybe). People are abandoning it in droves. But that's not sth that is covered in the news. You should worry more about how Malaysia is faring rather than how Europe decides to integrate its muslims.. I think I have to jump in here and give a piece of my experience although it is just anecdote.

10years back when I was a mahasiswa, my uni took in a batch of China students and the first thing we have to do as local Chinese students is to bring them around guiding them and educate them about Malaysia. They called us Malay which we have to spend times correct them about this vocabulary issue. 

Once they know the rough idea, the first thing they asked us was ""when do you want to return to  motherland?"", which a lot of us get slightly offended. Understanding that they are still new and don't really know the whole situation here in Malaysia, we just brush it off but tell them we are Malaysian Chinese, yes we are Chinese and our ancestors come from China, but we are Malaysian and won't go back to China (ironically the politicians here always accuse Chinese of the opposite), Malaysia come first for us not China.

The whole guiding China student project make us quite excited at first because we can help foreigner know and experience Malaysia (not because they are China~~~). But the project ended with a bad taste in our month because of how entitled and bad manner these China student was, we hang them out to dry at the end of the project.

I think a lot of the people don't realise is that the younger generation of Malaysian Chinese don't relate with China, we are booked and raised here in Malaysia. We drink tea tarik, eat roti canai, celebrate Raya and have a piece a tapi over in our Malay friends house.  I do know a lot of my friends dislike or even borderline on hating China. We identified as Malaysian first and foremost but  all those ridiculous claim of cina balik tongsan by politician for political gain make us feel like 2nd class citizens, the place we called home don't make us feel at home.. No, you are so very wrong and very insulting to people from SJKC, you are saying they are all morons who cannot think. These people also studied Malay, English, Math, Science, some even learned some computer language in computer classes. Why aren't you saying there were/are secret British indoctrination in English language school material, or some kind of ""Malays are our masters"" propaganda in Malay language class?

But yes some people are morons, and when I hear people talk of China being their motherland it is definitely weird, to say the least since they grew up here, especially if young people say that, they sound like ungrateful morons. But that may be just a matter of political correctness, Ancestral country Á•ñÂõΩ is more politically correct but still weird (just say China you dumb cunts), instead of something more sinister as to be secret zombie cells of the CCP.. [removed]. [removed]. >No, you are so very wrong and very insulting to people from SJKC, you are saying they are all morons who cannot think.

The definition of 'useful idiot' is here: 
Not implying anyone is a moron. 

>Why aren't you saying there were/are secret British indoctrination in English language school material, or some kind of ""Malays are our masters"" propaganda in Malay language class?

Yes, there could be British propaganda or Malay propaganda in classes, that's why i said people should be thinking critically and openly question anything doubtful in class. But since CCP propaganda is the news everywhere nowadays and not British or Malay propaganda, people have to be extra vigilant on anything connected directly or indirectly to China.

>But yes some people are morons, and when I hear people talk of China being their motherland it is definitely weird, to say the least since they grew up here, especially if young people say that, they sound like ungrateful morons.

Agreed. For me, only barely acceptable (as in really near borderline unacceptable) for those first and second generation Chinese Malaysians to say China their motherland but completely and utterly unacceptable for third gen above.. [removed]. [removed]. **Useful idiot**

In political jargon, a useful idiot is a derogatory term for a person perceived as propagandizing for a cause without fully comprehending the cause's goals, and who is cynically used by the cause's leaders. The term was originally used during the Cold War to describe non-communists regarded as susceptible to communist propaganda and manipulation. The term has often been attributed to Vladimir Lenin, but this attribution is unsubstantiated.

But you are, you are just too condescending to know. You think Malay propaganda is not in the news, are you fucking kidding me? But yes, both sides anti-China, pro-China are certainly ""loudly"" on the internet.

Acceptable or not if someone refer to China as motherland is a matter of opinion, you are talking like a fascist, acceptable not acceptable, the world does not revolve around you. I don't like it either, but I'd categorize that as personal annoyance, instead of betrayal even though it seem like people *drink of the water yet not appreciate the source* (Chinese idiom), if they want to say whatever, go ahead (because it's not of high importance).

But about that idiom above, the source does go right back to China if you keep going, but then back to caveman if you go even further back, nothing to do with CCP so please, calm down.

Contoh: white power, white supremacy. Dua istilah ini umum diterima berbaur racism. Mengapa tidak ketuanan melayu? Orang lain kat sini dah petik apa yang VC to kata.

You seriously want to talk about 'spreading political ideology'? What about the fact that royalty is supposed to be neutral but had to beg for people to vote BN last year? Dah lupa ke?. Laws allow university students to join politics, now you say unis is no place to spread political ideologies. 

Is it not a place to spread political ideologies or is it not a place to spread political ideologies that are hostile to you?. Be a good boy and go study hard, then listen to your boss ah, later can get rich like me! - Max Heguy. Ada aku kesah? Bukan titah Sultan.. WTH? University is exactly the place you should explore ideas and question your world view!. I have to disagree with them. these people are young adults, and it's the best way to get them to know about malaysian politics. plus, is it political ideologies in a malaysia party sense, or political ideologies in general?. Gaddam Max Heguy back at it again !. Also, I'd like to add that this is ironic coming from someone who has never attended university.. i think he's aiming this towards the university management. i might be wrong tho but his statement is pretty vague, not necessarily aimed at the student activist.. Defying the system is dangerous, we should not do anything that might destablise the system.

A lot of people's rice bowl depends on the current system.. He didn't even attend university? Wow TIL. He attended a military academy in India, and served in their military

 it's not like he was just an SPM student who did nothing.

The actual fun fact is that , that military branch is probably filled with other rich kids just like him, playing at war with 0 danger.. it's a cavalry branch , in the 21st century.",304.0,8,1,0

Seeing some pictures of it, I believe this sort of book isn't suitable for schools. Seems like a way to spread propaganda by China to me. There's also some part of the book that blames Najib and making PH as the hero to which it's true but again I believe children shouldn't be involve in politic.. Is this book mocking China or supporting China? I'm confused. The win-winism obviously mocks Xi Jin pooh but the content is about the greatness of China?

After much digging, I found out that the author is a hardcore China's fan. I'm surprised the book got approved in the first place. 

> Hew, better known as ‚ÄòSuperman Hew‚Äô, was a former DAP member. He quit the party in July 2016 after his Facebook post, claiming that South China Sea ‚Äúbelongs to Beijing‚Äù caused a stir..

Hey he even looks like Xinnie the Pooh!. >‚ÄúIn the said comic book, there is a picture of Tun Dr Mahathir  Mohamad with notes stating that the comic book was a gift from him (Dr  Mahathir) to (President of China) Xi Jinping during their meeting on the  sidelines of the Belt and Road Summit and Forum in Beijing in April  this year.  
>  
>‚ÄúThe Prime Minister‚Äôs Office would like to state that this book was  not an official gift during the said meeting and it was brought without  going through proper procedures and channels,‚Äù the statement read.

The comic and it's author is a disgrace.. Hope it's made of absorbent material, senang nak lap bontot with it. 

Absolute rubbish move by PH. Put Hew Kuan Yau on a stake. Better yet, deport him back to his beloved motherland. Need to investigate whether there's any CCP backing behind the scenes, any compromised individuals etc. Buddy, wake up.  The kids in the SRJK(C) have long been sold the narrative that they are oppressed -- by their parents, and by (some) of their more parochial teachers.  I think it is no different in the SRJK(T).

These kids are already politically aware.. Hew Kuan Yau has no business even having that position to begin with. DAP has to burn all bridges with him because he's an insane loose cannon whose ideals genuinely run counter to Malaysian national interest. Don't even need PasNo cubertroopers to lie about DAP with him around.. Did you read the article? PH didn't make the comic book.. They don‚Äôt have to be sold. Wait till it‚Äôs time for them to apply for government scholarships/universities/workplace, then they will see for them selves what it is really like..

His speech was recorded right?. Where? My results are news portals with mostly no comment sections?. > ‚ÄúWhat gall this person, who got his permanent residency through the backdoor, has to sue a Malaysian born and bred here.

Yeah I think Ramasamy is going way overboard with this statement. sorry, the news portal youtube channels. I believe most new portals don't have their own comment section, for very obvious reason. If the elements are fulfilled, Zakir has right to recompense from the court, as anyone in the country. That's equality before the law. I don't get all the down votes. I myself dont agree with that statement too.. Lol, should've thought about that, thanks.. He has the right to sue, he has no right to recompense.

Damages is not a right.. No worries. My bad.. If the elements are fulfilled and there is defamation as pronounced by the Court, he is entitled to damages from the fellow as ordered from the court. However much is dependent on the Court's discretion and precedent.. he is only entitled if defendants don't have a valid defence. Meeting the elements is only like 30% of the battle for him. If you have the standing to so, defendant probably met all the elements more often than not. The threshold is really really low.. Heres how it goes. Defamation is to be proven first, then the defendant has to prove defence if any ie here seems to veer to justification. You're quite right in a way, but the 30% all that I'm unsure. I havent read what he published, but if it's clear cut then yes defamation is easily proven and it's only for this fellow to prove his defence ie justification, fair comment or qualified privilege. I understand how defamation works. I think by now you should tell i am no layman.. Well glad to meet a fellow lawyer here.. A law student ain't a lawyer bro. Agak poyo di situ dengan mengatakan 'I'm no layman' padahal grad pun belum, lol.. If that's the case, then our friend should really check his attitude. I've been in this industry for 5 years and I will always allow myself to be guided by better minds, regardless of age or seniority.. Haha. As the saying goes, an empty can makes the loudest noise. 

Must have been a wild 5 years in the legal industry bro. Keep working hard and make partner soon!. Still looking forward to more wilder experience Haha üòÜüòÜ, thanks man!

For the record, our friend is right to a certain extent, just slight adjustment needed to the explanation that's all.. Your friend la kot, not mine, lol.

To me, if one wants to debate about a legal point with a lawyer, be a lawyer yourself first la baru cerita. 

A law student saying 'Kau tak payah nak ajar aku pasal law, aku expert dalam hal law' to a seasoned lawyer is just bloody embarrassing. Aku baca pun malu siot.. üòÖüòÖüòÖ its okayla, we all learn and grow. He will soon learn how legal practice actually is and hopefully grows better from it.

102,(In Chinese): Malaysia workers protest to demand unpaid wages from Chinese Developer,djymcs,2019-10-19 03:54:06,notexthere,54,0.9,5.0,"Translation: Country Garden Central Park Contractor Allegedly Owed Workers 6 Months Salary, Malaysia's Central Park ""Shocked""

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, October 18, 2019] Dozens of¬†Malaysian¬†construction workers gathered on Wednesday (16th) to pull banners at Country Garden Central Park to protest wages owed by engineering secondary contractors for at least half a year. ¬†The incident also raised concerns about the prospects of the mainland¬†real estate industry¬†.

According to the news, the protest was a group of construction workers who were owed wages by secondary contractors.¬†Protest outside the construction site of¬†Country Garden¬†Central Park¬†Superior Apartment Project.

Some netizens said in a tweet, ""¬†Malaysia¬†construction workers have asked Country Garden and China Construction Group Co., Ltd. (CSCC) to pay wages. The CCP has passed the 'One¬†Belt, One Road¬†' initiative to export corruption and Chinese-style wage defaults to other countries. """"

The video shows that dozens of local laborers have produced two banners, one with ""Country Park Central Park and my hard-earned money"", and the other banner reads ""China Construction Second Bureau is also my hard-earned money.""


It is reported that the ""China Construction Second Bureau"" is the full name of ""China Construction Second Engineering Bureau"" and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of cSCEc.¬†It has successively opened overseas construction tasks in Iraq, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Algeria, South Africa, Malaysia, and Cambodia.

The local media quoted a source as saying that the protest was different from the previous ‚ÄúCountry Forest City‚Äù protests. The last time the company was in arrears was the supplier, and this time it was involved in the arrears of wages. Construction workers in the park project.

The source said that the common feature of the two protests was that the prime contractors cooperating with the developers were all contracting companies from China, and the subcontractors they subcontracted were in arrears or salary.

He said that the ""One¬†Belt, One Road¬†"" initiative of the CCP has advertised a ""win-win"" situation in the past, but such incidents have occurred many times and can only actually hit the reputation of Chinese contractors.¬†In the future, such incidents will continue to emerge and it is hoped that the Malaysian authorities will protect the rights of local suppliers and workers.

In response, Central Park issued a brief statement stating that the case was not directly related to the company and was a contractual dispute between the main contractor Dac Properties and the secondary contractor.

According to the mainland's ""Financial News"" earlier reported, Damansara Realty has proposed to combine DAC Properties with Country Garden Holdings to develop a comprehensive town in Johor Bahru, the capital of Johor, Malaysia.¬†The company and Country Garden will each hold 30% and 70% of the joint venture.

The mainland economic downturn, the housing market, the trade war is even worse

Country Garden is the largest¬†real estate¬†developer in the mainland and a Fortune 500 company.¬†However, since the Sino-US trade war, the Chinese economy has continued to decline, and the real estate industry has also experienced a downturn.¬†The bubble in China's housing market remains a deadly risk to the Chinese economy.

Although the authorities once tried to curb excessive housing price increases and accelerate the bubble crisis, they once ordered a limit on buying and selling to suppress the housing market. However, as the trade war hit the Chinese economy, the authorities began to loosen and hope that real estate will once again become the locomotive for GDP.

However, on the whole, in addition to the first-tier cities such as the North, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the current housing market in China has entered the late stage of oversupply and high housing prices. In addition, the poor environmental economy and rising unemployment have led to a sharp decline in housing sales. House prices have also gradually declined.

He Qingyi, a Chinese economic expert from the United States, pointed out that starting from 2016, mainland housing prices can no longer rise. It is said that the price of the North and the Guangzhou-Shenzhen, which will never fall, has fallen by an average of 15% since the end of 2016, and speculators are abandoning. city.¬†In the first half of this year, more than 270 real estate companies in the mainland declared bankruptcy.¬†The reason for the bankruptcy of these housing enterprises is mainly the break of the capital chain.

He Qingyu said that the mainland's economic difficulties are due to internal structural problems, and the trade war is only worse.

In addition, the ""One Belt, One Road"" project advocated by the CCP for the so-called ""pure economy"" has also been criticized in recent years. The outside world has always questioned the purpose of including economic strength, diplomatic and military expansion.¬†Therefore, in recent years, the project has been resisted by many countries.

After Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir took office in May last year, he began to review the Chinese-funded projects approved by former Prime Minister Najib.¬†In August, Mahathir publicly announced that it would stop the $24 billion CCP to support infrastructure projects, including the East Coast Railway and three oil and gas pipelines.¬†The Country Garden Forest City project has also become one of the key cases to be reviewed.

Mahathir believes that the CCP‚Äôs deal with Malaysia is ‚Äúunfair‚Äù and advocates against ‚Äúneo-colonialism‚Äù.

Previously, Pakistan had requested the cancellation of the $14 billion Diamo Basha dam. The reason for the country was that the CCP‚Äôs financing conditions were too harsh; Nepal decided to stop the $2.5 billion Buda Gandaki hydropower station under the responsibility of the Gezhouba Group. It is a violation of regulations and a lack of competitive bidding process; in addition, Myanmar has stopped the $3.6 billion dam project as early as 2015.

Foreign media analysis, although the reasons behind the decision of the three countries to cancel Chinese-funded projects are different, but a common factor is that these poor countries are increasingly aware that asking the CCP to build huge infrastructure projects will harm its own interests. The locals pay a very high price.

The CCP has invested heavily in Sri Lanka to build projects in the country's roads, ports and convention centers.¬†In the end, Sri Lanka was unable to repay this ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù debt, and the country‚Äôs Khan Bentota port was leased to the CCP for 99 years.

Pedophile Island is what I want to see... I wonder will this Island one day have law and order... for those that says Australia, only small time criminals are send to Australia, a large numbers of the whites residing there are traders, solders, merchants, craftsmans, farmers and etc, not decedents of prisoners or criminals. Once these small criminals served their time, they are released on good behavior, hardcore criminals are not released.. Unfortunately due to the race of the victim and perpetrator, this will turn into a racial issue,  watch as malays defend this guy and try to push the blame on the girl, probably for something stupid like she's enticing the robber by wearing shorts and she would have been fine if she covered her aurat. They'll cry discrimination and say 'ditindas di bumi sendiri' when the guy gets punished and blame DAP. Mark my words.. >A urine test showed that he tested positive for both methamphetamine and amphetamine


Drug addiction and probably other issues.. He's so young, it's unfortunate that he had to take this path. Hopefully he received rehab treatment because prison is definitely not go make his behavior stop..  Sounds similar to ""Escape From New York"". What??. Oh please just fuck off. The Malay will actually request for hudud to cuts his hand.. You need someone to talk to? You sound like life ain't doing you so good lately.. Its true! its true. He's a 5 times offender. This guy doesn't deserve any second chance anymore. >rehab treatment

1. Kongres yang dianjurkan secara bersama oleh empat buah universiti, mempunyai satu matlamat utama iaitu menyatukan orang Melayu bagi mengangkat semula kegemilangan umat Melayu di negara ini

2. Usman Awang pernah berkata ‚ÄúMelayu itu pengembara lautan, melorongkan jalur sejarah zaman. Begitu luas daerah sempadan. Begitulah hebatnya Melayu. Merentas samudera, meneroka dunia.‚Äù

3. Tetapi, setelah 62 tahun merdeka, adakah kita masih menjadi bangsa yang diangkat maruahnya, dihormati kehebatannya. Tentu tuan-tuan bertanya-tanya, mengapakah kita berada di sini.

4. Hadirin dan hadirat sekalian. Setahun yang lalu, berlaku peralihan tampuk kepimpinan negara. Maka lahirlah harapan orang Melayu untuk melihat masa depan yang lebih terjamin. Malangnya, peralihan ini disulami perpecahan politik Melayu, sehingga menghilangkan dominasi politik Melayu.

5. Lebih parah lagi, selepas 62 tahun menikmati kemerdekaan, ekonomi orang Melayu masih ibarat melukut di tepi gantang. Ekuiti korporat Melayu/Bumiputra sekadar 23.4%. Manakala bukan Bumiputra memegang 34.8% dan ekuiti asing 37.2%. Ini menunjukkan sasaran Dasar Ekonomi Baru masih belum tercapai.

6. Bukan itu sahaja. Jurang pendapatan isi rumah juga makin melebar, dengan jumlah pendapatan Melayu Bumiputra 3.5 kali ganda lebih rendah berbanding kaum Cina bagi purata Malaysia pada tahun 2016.

7. Dunia pendidikan pula semakin mencabar. Pendidikan kebangsaan disaingi oleh pendidikan berasaskan kaum. Bahasa Melayu bukan lagi tonggak sehinggakan Falsafah Pendidikan Kebangsaan tercabar. Malahan, akhir-akhir ini, hak keistimewaan Melayu, agama Islam, institusi raja, mulai dipersoalkan satu-persatu.

8. Tuan-tuan dan Puan-puan yang dihormati sekalian. Bukankah kuasa politik itu seharusnya milik kita. Bukankah hasil-mahsul negara ini sepatutnya memakmurkan kita. Bukankah pendidikan itu boleh menyatukan kita sebagai rakyat Malaysia. Bukankah hak orang Melayu yang termaktub dalam Perlembagaan Persekutuan sepatutnya sudah selesai.

9. Justeru itulah, berdasarkan soal-soalan yang dibangkitkan, Pusat Kajian Kecemerlangan Melayu Universiti Malaya, bersama dengan Universiti Putra Malaysia, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris dan Universiti Teknologi Mara, bergabung tenaga bagi meneliti keresahan dan kegusaran orang Melayu/Bumiputra.

10. (Penerangan tentatif pembentangan dan penyerahan resolusi)

11. Kami berharap, dapatan kongres ini menjadi ikrar penyatuan tanpa mengira latar ideologi, demi maruah dan masa depan orang Melayu.

12. Hadirin dan hadirat yang dihormati sekalian. Selaku Pengerusi Penganjuran Kongres Maruah Melayu, saya amat gembira melihat sambutan luar biasa yang diberikan kepada kongres ini atas nama perpaduan Melayu. Ini menunjukkan Melayu Islam di negara ini mampu bersatu demi perpaduan bangsa dan kemajuan negara. Dalam konteks negara ini, adalah mustahil kemajuan dapat dicapai tanpa penglibatan kelompok majoriti di kalangan anak negeri.

13. (Ucapan terima kasih dan penghargaan)

14. Semoga Allah S.W.T. memberi kekuatan kepada kita untuk terus mengangkat maruah melayu di negara ini demi memartabatkan Melayu/Bumiputera, Melayu Islam dan membangunkan negara ini bersama kaum-kaum lain.",13,0.69,44.0,"bla bla bla

Not if you dont work for it and expect riches to be handed to you (good example are felda smallholders, who get EVERYTHING provided for them, land,fertilizer, seeds...but choose to pajak to indons for 50%. and when palm oil prices go down, they complain like fuck cos they dont make money . Duh...if you worked the land like you are supposed to and get 100% of the profits...you would make money)

>Bukankah hak orang Melayu yang termaktub dalam Perlembagaan Persekutuan sepatutnya sudah selesai.

Nope. You are a VC..you are supposed to be educated..stop spouting nonsense about hak bumiputera. NEP should have ended decades ago.

Stop saying nons are trying to remove royalty and religion. The speech: Full of racist points. Blaming the Chinese for taking away their power and wealth when they had been on crutches for 60+ years. 

OP: Is it really racist though...

Sultan, Raja, PM, DPM, most ministers and senates are Malay and yet Chinese are the one who took away everything. If you can't better yourself with all the handouts and special treatments, I don't know what to tell you. The Indians and Chinese started from nothing.... Listening and reading sth like this gets boring (and hurtful) over time. üòü Blergh.. can you share the video? Sometimes the tone of the voice is also important.. If the malays want to reclaim their country back, they have to do it hardcore style. They would need:

  
\- A nationalist political organization filled with smart, honest, hardworking people who are non-corrupt and willing to get their hands dirty. Seize power with absolute majority, and reshape Malaysia as they see fit.  
\- Nationalise corporations that don't align themselves with the ruling party. Seize licences from defiant companies.  
\- A coup in the supreme courts.  
\- Solidarity with other nativist groups in other countries. Make pan-austronesianism a thing, a culture even.  
\- Abandon Islam as a state religion. Islam has always been a thorn in the side of the nationalists. Its message of ""peace"" and ""solidarity"" with nons would complicate matters. We need a fully secular, nationalist mindset. Islamists cannot be trusted, since their interest lie with pan-Islamism, which is very much irrelevant in this day and age where nation-states rule. Besides, Islamists are usually one step from radicalisation from becoming terrorists.   
\- The first needed step is full secularity of the constitution. Next, cultivate a culture that celebrates nusantara as a whole, instead of just the ""malay"" viewpoint. ""Malay"" is a constructed identity that started from the islamisation of malacca. This identity needs to be decontructed, and replaced with a regional pan identity - an austronesian identity, sth akin to pancasila.  
\- The peninsular malays must cultivate strong relationship with the borneans. Solidarity with native east malaysians is important and vital.  
\- In the absence of religion, the only unifying force for the natives of Malaysia will be a new identity based on common shared heritage, genetics, and language, which is fulfilled by the austronesian identity.  
\- The biggest obstacle to a common austronesian identity is abrahamic religions i.e. Islam and christianity, since the religions favour co-religionists rather than genetic kinship. This is why malays cry for arabs despite having nothing to do with them. Why they are anti-israel. Abrahamic religion is retarded, they make proxy enemies out of everyone. The malays as a whole, never have quarrel with the israelis. Why the fuck we are so against them is utter stupidity. As if the arabs cry for what's happening in southern  thailand. That's a fact.   
\- We need to be educated on our past. Censorship must be uplifted. We must stop people from being dumb and ignorant, which is usually the goal of the gov with islamic bent. They fear that people might start thinking for themselves.  
\- A lot of malays that I have met, people in my family, are severely dumb when it comes to world history and philosophy. I cannot quote descartes and kant without seeing a chuckle on their faces. They think that life is a simple formula. Get a job, get married, go to haj, and die and go to paradise. They've been all mentally compromised, drunk on religion and false promise of heavenly maidens. But what can I say? sex sells. even god knows that.. when malay say it, racist, etc. etc.


when cina/india do it, oh its ok, freedom of speech etc.


yeay for malaya baru. Oh the irony... look at the VIP audience. In that hall alone, a whole bunch of millionaires and a handful of billionaires. All of them are people in charge. The only struggling malays are the students and their attendance is compulsory.

Can't make this shit up.. i can see nonsense but where is the *racism*?. is it really racist?

/s. Youre right. The blame is on the white devils and the Japs from the past. Pening la baca...perenggan xde ni. > Abandon Islam

LOL your plan pretty much breaks down from here. Do show me a case when Chinese/Indians say things like ""Malaysia for Cina and India"". 

Or someone holding a keris and say things like ""this will be bathed in the blood of Malay!""

Or said things like ""Malays are Pendatang!"". Bro, you gotta back up your claim! That's how reddit arguments are done. Come on! Maruah at stake here man..!. In the same context you mean ? I believe everyone attending it would have been killed or arrested for stirring shit. Else, pls explain what you mean, I will wait.. Boleh tolong tunjuk kat mana ya? Orang perseorangan tak boleh ye, mesti orang/kumpulan di pentas awam. a racist is one that feels he is superior to others because of his race. Not because of what he has acheived, or what he has studied..but because of his BIRTH. In the transkrip you posted...he says very clearly political power belongs to his race.....thats racist. >Bukankah kuasa politik itu seharusnya milik kita.

>Bukankah hasil-mahsul negara ini sepatutnya memakmurkan kita

>Bukankah hak orang Melayu yang termaktub dalam Perlembagaan Persekutuan sepatutnya sudah selesai.

karliky: where da rasicism?. Viewing everything through the lense of race is simply a slippery slope towards racism. Malay equity there, Malay political power here, when the actual problem is the wealth gap that exists among all racial groups, the political power that obviously rest in the hands of a few people, Malay no less?

Also, saying Malays should be united hints at others being the enemy, no?. The fact that there is a congress called 'Kongres Maruah Melayu', shows racism. 

Any event that has a title 'Kongres Maruah <insert group name>"" is racist.. If you think about it, ""seharusnya milik kita"" is the very basis of Israel and something you would find in Mein Kampf.. Other than this sentence, the rest is ok but it already sets a premise and precedence for the entire speech.. Really?. and not just random ppl on the street....powerful ppl...people in positions of authority. is this racism or just people being salty they dont get to be big dog anymore?. yes the congress is racist. no one would say other wise. 

question is VC speech was racist as it was portrayed by the UM protest?. do point where.

all i see is a guy lamenting, complaining on how his people has fall from grace.. You can be salty and racist at the same time. It's not mutually exclusive. 

In this case, he cleared stated power, wealth and special rights should belong to the Malay race. He didn't even dress it up subtly. 

Hitler said the same things before committing genocide. Was he salty too?. What are you even talking about? Malays have always been the big dogs.. The entire VIP audience ARE the big dogs!! All of them millionaire/billionaire ministers and leaders in charge of the nation, they are not the poor and oppressed (those are the students sitting way at the back). The other ex-ministers and menteri besar not present is because they are being charged with corruption. Where's Kunan??. Yup, as pointed out by jwrx and others it clearly shows racism. Blaming other races is racist itself. Salty for not being top dog itself is also a form of racism. Suggesting that everything must be under a single race is also racist. The worst is, their delusional mindset on the history of Malaysia is still set to the Tanah Melayu days. Malaysia is technically 56yrs not 62yrs, that itself shows that they think Malaysia is only comprise of Tanah Melayu, totally sidelining the East as a whole, which shows that they think they are the only ""true"" race of this country, this itself is also a form of racism.. Pemikiran rasis tak semestinya perlu dizahirkan terhadap mana2 kaum, cukup kalau memegang pemikiran bahawa kaum sendiri (atau kaum lain in the case of internalized racism) lebih tinggi darjatnya dari yang lain atas dasar kaum sahaja.

Contoh: white power, white supremacy. Dua istilah ini umum diterima berbaur racism. Mengapa tidak ketuanan melayu? Orang lain kat sini  dah petik apa yang VC to kata.

E: i dont agree with what the um student did. Like jwrx said though. That kuasa politik belongs to them. I mean, it isn't about asking malays to stand up. The speech was about how other people is to blame. Education. Us questioning the article. The whole thing has malay supremacy implied. The speech talks about how they deserve the glory and respect. But they don't address why or what needs to be done themselves.

He tells malays how far behind they are, and then implies it's because of other people. Creates fear then directs their animosity to other people. Hak Melayu by itself is discriminatory, no matter how deserved the Malays feel.. Please do not downvote kalkry. He asked a valid question. We want to encourage questions like these, not discourage it.. that kuasa politik **should** belong to them but in reality does not. is he lamenting about how his race fucked up big time and broke due petty politic can be called racist? cmmon. 

>the speech was about how other people is to blame

which mostly towards malay themselves, this part was the crux of mahathir speach. lazy malay, malay that taking thigns for granted, malay that does not participate on politics whatever. is this also racism?  

>the whole thing has malay supremacy implied

fair point.

>speech talks about how they deserve the glory and respect. But they don't address why or what needs to be done themselves

its the opening speech, what malay need to do was presented by other speaker. which mostly was coo-coo (ptptn only for malay among everything else)

[for what its worth even ISMA does not buy this Kongres Maruah Melayu as a whole.]( while i didnt downvote him...multiple ppl have replied to his questions and explicitly stated their reasoning and even pointed out the sections that are deemed racists. If he chooses to remain blind/obtuse, it deserves to be downvoted. >that kuasa politik should belong to them but in reality does not. is he lamenting about how his race fucked up big time and broke due petty politic can be called racist? cmmon. 

Mind enlightening us how is it not when the Malays are the majority? Because DAP are in the government? Isn't he suggesting that Malays should simply be voting for certain party to have ""political power""? Or that others simply shouldn't be allowed to vote? Either is racist in itself, ya?. >that kuasa politik should belong to them  

**WHY?**. I think you're doing a little gymnastics here tho. Okay let's put the blame aside and the lazy malays aside. The thought of how it ""should"" belong to them, isn't that racist enough? I mean, shouldn't we be progressive and let anyone who are good at politics to be in politics? If a Chinese fella come and say ""It should belong to chinese!"" Isn't that about a race supremacy or at least putting their own race first? But why does it have to be race first? 

Your second paragraph is not implied, at all. It blames other people, and obviously it focuses on correcting the ""issue"" asking vernacular schools to be abolished, and getting angry when the article is being question. Just like MARA digital malls. It starts with yourself. It doesn't start with other people. You don't tear down other people to gain level ground. You build yourself up. 

At face value, it is racist. You seem to need to do a lot of maksud tersirat exercises just to justify it. Am I wrong in saying that?. I'm not defending him, but I acknowledge that when a person grows up and live around certain mentality most of their life, it's hard to grasp why it is wrong when it's been so normalised. Sometimes they try to justify it because it's hard to change a way of life that's been around for very long. I'm not saying it's right ah, I am saying it's human to try to defend their way of life esp when you got it good. It takes a lot of effort to change hearts and minds. If only it takes so little to get through to them, we won't have today. Patience and empathy; if it's something I can still offer, I would. 

I want to encourage discussions, I don't want them silenced. I don't want an echo chamber. I don't want them to be afraid to continue asking. That's how we exchange ideas. They might not have a lot of non-bumi friends irl to understand how we feel, so reddit *should* be a safe place for them to ask these questions. I know that's very idealistic of me to think so; I'm still saying it.

At least he's not like anembor or xelmi.. >Mind enlightening us how is it not when the Malays are the majority?

PM, DPM, Majority malay MPs, Majority malay Senators...but all they can see is cinababi LGE or LKS. They are the majority in a democracy but somehow that being not enough it has to be some kind of god ordained right. *if you need to justify what appears to be racist on a face value then it IS racist*

fair enough. Good to know I'm not the only one here thinking this way. 

Sweeping it under the carpet and pretending all is well instead of facing the difficult questions face on are why we continue to 'hate' one another on the behest of politicians who are looking out for their personal interests ‚Äî ""let the pawns fight each other, we'll swoop in later and claim victory without as much as lifting a finger"".

Agree wholeheartedly about the upbringing and environmental influence bit ‚Äî distrust and resentment festers from the lack of honest discourse and inability to accept a dissenting view.. I foresee you might use what I said above on other things; I hope you have the wisdom to know the difference when the time comes. Lazy malay comments is how you individually choose to consume it. To me you're doing a ""maybe its this, maybe its that.""

I want to take your comment positively.",2530.0,13,406,0

Then slap him with a fine or send him to the discipline board or something. What's the need to report to the police that charge him for ""intentional insult to provoke a breach of peace"" and take away his hard earn degree that he also paid for?. OK so he was rude? Is being rude a crime? Is being rude a reason to erase his hard work of obtaining his degree? How about his message? How about the message he was protesting against?. Both is wrong. The vc is wrong. The boy also wrong. Two wrongs doesnt make one right. What is the different if u do wrong then u pointed others do wrong things?. Just here to say I agree with everything you said.. I don't know much about UM's internal rules or whether their disciplinary board have any authority to fine or withold his degree.

But we do have laws regulating public behaviour, so its within the university's right to lodge a police report if they think the law has been broken. 

One such law I can think of is our Minor Offences Act 1955 specifically the clause on inappropriate public behaviour. Pay RM100 fine.

Many countries have similar laws e.g.United Kingdom Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and the Australian Prohibited Behaviour Orders Act 2010.

Of course a police report needs to be made so the police can investigate.. Its not a crime but its going to make your message be drown, get less sympathy and twisted against you. 

Cultural faux pas that was, my dude. Being civil and polite doesn't hurt anyone, while being selfish and rude is intolerable to all especially to us Asian. Although I don't agree with some of the VC action of late, I do think that there is a place and channel for us to vent these frustration.. you get wrongception. the best kind of wrong. Oh well, if it's not a crime then I don't see why it should be reported to a police or that it's the main focus rather than the message itself. Literally no one is talking about his message now, so I agree with the point you are making.

It's like most of us (perhaps only those who criticize him) do not learn about disliking with the manner but still taking note of the message. I thought that's something that should be picked up by working adults... KMM is faux pas at a larger degree, even though I don't agree with the student's actions.. I do not deny that first part, I even admitted it from the off. 

>being selfish and rude is intolerable to all especially to us Asian.

That's totally subjective. And I don't think you should represent all Asians. Also, the message of the VC at the Congress was even more selfish and rude but the silence is deafening compared to this case (may not referring to you).. Did he caused a scene like yelling and chanting or he was just holding the banner silently???. What kind of wrong did i did wrong. So everything is wrong now. üòî. Thats the ‚Äútwist against ya‚Äù crowd doing their thang.. Faux pas implies that it was a genuine mistake/blunder. The maruah tercabar congress is a deliberate undertaking to send a message to the nons that this is tanah melayu.. Being civil is not subjective at all and I'm as qualified as you are when speaking on shared value like how the need of the community triumph over selfish need seeing I'm also an Asian. In any case isn't the fifth Rukunegara listed down courtesy and morality as part of our nation principle? Again, there is a place for everything; we have (limited) free speech; If that guy didn't like how things are being managed then maybe after graduation he should consider becoming a politician or something. After all, the bar to become one in our country is very low..  He did cause a scene, raised his arm and shouted. That's kinda the point  And the rest just follow through without using their own critical brain, sigh.. Can also mean improper. But they will argue that the intention is not to threaten other people but more like ""malay pride"". Argue it's not a zero sum game. I suppose I can understand where they are coming from even if I don't agree. It's like a muscle car event; it's about cars, no intention to exclude motorbikes, buses, and trains, if we want to take it in the most neutral manner. However.

Will this float if the tables were turned? Don't think so. Also having a car show is one thing, but to proclaim that all roads belongs to cars is another thing. That's the difference. That's where it went wrong. If not, I'd have to agree, it is about empowering malays. Nothing wrong with that. Too focused on their race, yes, but still nothing wrong with that.. Lol, dude, every adjective, unless so defined in laws, IS subjective. You are qualified, sure, but don't act as if it's universal. And again, morality and courtesy are subjective, I'm sure the rukun negara doesn't define them or being legally binding (I doubt morality is in it but let's leave let alone).

I agree there is place for everything, but it doesn't seem like you actually get the idea of protesting... And yeah, let's wait until the issue has been forgotten, the VC has happily retired then only he should do something about it eh?. My guy just don‚Äôt understand the malays. Is it any surprise that people that bow their head 5 times a day towards a specific direction, thinks it fun to not eat & drink from dusk to dawn and views sex before marriage taboo, would have zealous regard for rituals and protocols?. Hi there, I agree with your interpretation. If the tables were turned, it would be Ops Lalang all over again. Haiz. Dude; the fifth principle (morality and courtesy) is part of rukunegara which define article 10 of our constituition and is not subjective.

Need I remind you that Rukunegara was made the nation guiding principle exactly because of racial tension after the 13th May incident and that our constituition says that every citizen has the right to freedom of speech provided it didn't go against public order or morality;

'Parliament may, by law impose on the rights conferred by paragraph (every citizen has the right to freedom of speech and expression) of Clause (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or of any Legislative Assembly or to provide against contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to any offence'. You make a fair point here, but I don't think being religious should remove one's ability to be critical, although it's often that way. And no, it's more of the unwillingness to discuss the message that's baffling me.. Wut? The rukun negara has zero legal binding on any Malaysian.. Dude, rukun negara is the guiding principle, not legally binding, I'm repeating myself here. It also most definitely does not define morality and courtesy, which is again subjective unless legally defined, pls point me to where it's defined otherwise. The same thing with ""go against public order"", which I'm sure the protest isn't something like that since it's about ONE person, but I can't say exactly that about the racist message by the VC.. Oh they are critical and quite able to understand the message against racism. But like i said, its being drowned out. Im sure they are many that agrees him but not being able to relate his methods. Alot of my peers dont agree with Congress maruah, but him shitting on convo event is not something avg folks can get behind.. So holding a placard, shouting and causing general disruption on a day where others are celebrating their hard earned achievment is somehow ok?  cant he protest on like, literally any other days? mmmkay then.. I see, perhaps the voices that support his message while disagreeing with his method are just not found in the media, as usual, since the bigger fools make the bigger noise..

111,The Malaysian Matriculation rules everybody....,djov2j,2019-10-18 15:10:59,notexthere,45,0.8,61.0,"Freedom of Religion but with Terms and Conditions.. Had a Buddhist roommate when I studied in Penang matriculation college. 4 bois, 3 Muslim 1 Buddhist. Everybody prayed in the same room. No problem, no hesitation, everybody asked everybody's permission to pray, 3 of us asked the Chinese's dude permission everytime we wanted to pray, same to the Chinese dude to us. There are also smoker who smoke and many of those who brought extension, I said this because both of those items are banned, nobody reported anybody. The law doesn't represent the people.. 3.5.3 - Pretty sure my friends just put whatever pics of her Gods on the wall,pray to em and even when the hallway smelled of colok, and the warden asked bout it, she still prayed like usual. Thats what you gotta do kan. Even had buses taking students to temple.

Nak meditate ke.. apa ke, I honestly dont think ppl would be bothered, like have the time to check heck what are you doing. If we were to take seriously all of what written, we are just gonna be bitter ppl lah.

Best to point out to the organization involved aite... i wonder why such rules were approved in the first place

even though im a non muslim, i wanna know what was the context of the situations that the lawmakers considered

by analysing the situation rationally and impartially, we can prevent ourselves from falling into  the rabbit hole of blaming islam or umno or whatever

and if the laws do not represent the current demographic, a revision is probably necessary. ~All religions must be treated equally and with respect

~Islam #1

Cast ur votes now. hormat muh budaya but fuck your budaya. i dont mind patung or colok inside uni,but must be on their own corner lh. Pretty sure 3.5.4 contradicts 3.5.3 unless Islam actually feels offended by foreign praying object. Oppressive religion confirmed by authority?. So hindus can't pray or meditate. Is this what they consider freedom of religion?

EDIT: As far as I know this is from the rule book of KMM(Melaka). The rules seems pretty fair at least for an atheist but I do believe that if any religion other than Islam that requires you to pray everyday you can apply with the administration and I think they‚Äôll approve, if not can go to KPM to complain.. Ramai sungguh bijak pandai dlm thread ni.... Kau masuk matrikulasi tak dulu OP? 
Roommate aku relax je letak gambar mary dalam locker. pagi2 sembahyang depan locker.. Sorry, which part of this is wrong?

The ""need to fill up the form"" ***seems*** fucked up, but in my experience **everyone** needs authorization if they want to stay overnight elsewhere at any time (outside holidays ofc) for **any** reason, and when I was in matriculation those who do it for non-Islamic religious reasons are always granted.

t. Budak Matrikulasi Penang. [Here]( I tried creating a new post with another title to see what kind of response we get. But it got deleted so I'll try again next time.. if that very rule wasn‚Äôt there whats stopping people from doing the extreme?. people who go to matriculation seems not having issue with this except op. maybe op is a racist and shitstirrer, which is normal for a strawberry gen nowdays. I.e. whole of malaysia in everything. Constitution trumped by syariah law. Race = religion suddenly.. This is a great example of common sense tolerance. We are people first. Respect and honour.. I agree. It's the organisation which implemented these rules who should be blamed. It is still possible to practice religion here but to implement laws where a person can be affected just because he practises it is still wrong. Even after 20 years no one, even the HEP bothered to raise doubts about these rules in the first place. It just shows how narrow minded the people who created and maintains the rules are.. The goal is to deter non-muslims from using the matriculation system, hence freeing up more seats for Muslims. Matric is a huge subsidy, so there's the financial motivation for this rule.. Isnt it written somewhere? 
Y malaysia liddis. When i was studying in matriculation, all of the other religions are given freedom to practice thier religion. Siap ada bas bawa pergi kuil. But yeah apa aku tau berbanding dengan kau OP. Not fair 9f it only applies to certain people. Well, Matriculation has been established for over 15 years, if proper religious freedom was not discussed before hand, I d ok n't think 1 person trying to complain is going to change anything. Plus i believe that the actual laws are different (no source) than this. This is only from KMM btw.. Imagine being a typical Malay and berlagak to non-malays 

""Dulu kau tak pergi matrikulasi kau jangan Banyak bunyi lah""

As if being part of a 90% allocation is something to be proud of. [deleted]. I have a feeling it's just a basic ""Name, ic, room number and reason to stay overnight elsewhere"".. [deleted]. What does religion have to do with racism?. Maybe some people do not dare speak out to avoid backlash from idiots like you?. But it‚Äôs public funding. To do to otherwise would be straight up intolerance.

Already have a quota, but still wanna impose rules like that. 

What financial motivation? Must nons already consider this country a gone case with regards to freedom of religion and the role of Islam in this country. They don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt give a flying fuck.

Secondary school curriculum is already a cluster fuck with regards to brainwashing in PM, BM and SEJ. Why would it matter anyway in matriculation  

This isn‚Äôt a deterrent this is straight up arrogance and intolerance. Then what's the point of the written clause doing there? Hmmmmm.... Well, it is in the rules. It does not matter if they verbally allow it. Then what is the point of having it in the first place?. > Siap ada bas bawa pergi kuil.

Reminds me of PLKN lol. Yo. I got 11As in SPM therefore I believe I was in matriculation by merit.
And I am not Malay.. Oh, that part. Guess it's my MM privilege.

To be fair though, if you meditate or get together with your friends to have a Bible study session or something I doubt you'll get in trouble.

Maybe.. > Name, ic, room number and reason to stay overnight elsewhere

Yeah, this is how it's done back in my day. Religious, medical or family reasons only get a free pass. If you want to balik rumah for fun (like I always do), that's more of a ""it depends on the mood of the warden"" territory.. Dude, they provide transportation to go to temple/church on the weekends.. Im not sure how you imagined how democracy works, but it‚Äôs the minority adapts to the majority. 

if that is oppression, try living in France without learning their national language for 4 generations, and see how they will treat you. the point is so people wont abuse it, for example bringing a cow to the premise for religion purposes. In all purpose and intent, a sabahan Muslim will always be treated as a Malay bumi in matrikulasi intake.

If you got 11As you should also be smart enough to not brag to non-malays about getting in matriks. [deleted]. Pretty sure that doesn‚Äôt justify the school‚Äôs policy to oppress other religion within the school campus though.

When people do that to islam, they‚Äôre consider islamphobia but it‚Äôs okay for you guys to do it to other religion? Double standard much?. [deleted]. There is a huge debate about this, French believe everyone holds French citizenship has french heritage, that means their past is not relevant, there is no Asian-French or African-French, French is a French and there is no special privileges whether you are 1 day citizen or citizen who inherits 10 French lineage. There is a different between French approach to North American approach where you are allowed to celebrate your own cultures as freely and still subscribes to notion of all cultures are part of American culture. IE Malaysia vs Indonesia. Before we‚Äôre getting to these arguments, our constitution doesn‚Äôt give any room for Malaysia to treat everyone equally. So there is no point of bringing these argument.. Well, a cow is pretty extreme. But what would they have against meditation? If they were against extremism like preaching, then i would agree.. You mean like how Muslim men abuse the solat jumaat to have extra long lunch break?. bringing a cow? you mean for slaughter during ramadan? /s

stop being hyperbolic. the comments in this thread have displayed that people are able to respect each other's religion and live together fine without the need for stupid rules made by power tripping assholes.. For korban izzit? 

Better bring goats/sheep. Offends no one, and also permitted.. I dont know why you're attacking him. He isn't berlagak. I get you have strong feelings on this, i do too, but do try to think if what you're typing brings anything new. Yeah but if you're in a college's shitlist, you're fucked anyway even if you're the most alim-est of Muslims.

The current situation is not ideal, but it's not exactly an undue burden in my experience. In KMPP (Penang Matriculation College) the Christian students (from EM) were provided a van to take them to church service.. Is it oppressing when they provide transportation to the temples/church every weekend?. Friday prayers are not compulsory though, you not knowing that fact has shown that you don‚Äôt even know how the majority lives in this country.  Yet here you are ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt want to be pressured to understand the majority‚Äù 

You know what they do to immigrants refused to give up their way of life? they beat the shit out of them and forced them out of the country. But sure, Malaysia is the worst place for the Chinese or Indian in this world.. In my company everyone ""abuse"" the lunch hour

Every single non-muslim, from the boss or  the staffs goes to lunch 12-2.

But welll, it's a Malay company.. would never fly in a cina apek company.. but is there any slaughter during Ramadhan at the premise? 

i‚Äôm simply explaining why the clause was there in the first place which is to avoid the extreme case  situation to happen, and this thread doesn‚Äôt represent 32 million people??????????. ""dont talk if tak pernah pergi matriks"" IS berlagak,. It‚Äôs oppressing when you‚Äôre not allowed to practise your own religion in your own campus when the Constitution permitted you to do so. In the freaking campus where non-Muslim and Muslim contributed their hard-earned tax money.. What I implied from my initial comment was did OP ever saw the real situation, where worshipping any god was prohibited or is it just based on this guide book. Come on now, dont tell me you are a man of the book, abide all the law. 

And I never say ""dont talk if tak pernah pergi matriks"" since the beginning, I need OP to realize other religion has always been able to do their praying plus special balik bermalam(muslim student are only allowed to balik bermalam if there is no college event).. What‚Äôs the criteria needed for a person to pray? For a muslim, all needed is a praying mat and water for ablution. What‚Äôs the criteria needed for a Hindu or Buddhists to pray?. Will your question justify and rationalise the intention to discriminate other religion because one religion is way superior than the other?. it‚Äôs not about superiority, if a shrine is needed for a Chinese to pray, what would you expect? do you expect the institution to provide a shrine at every corner?. You obviously have no idea how other religion works huh. Buddhist and Christian can just pray and meditate in a small corner just so you know.",1969.0,5,1,0

Hackers got hold of a PHP script that has the passwords of the Oracle database embedded. It could just be a bad server configuration that displays all the scripts as source code.

It‚Äôs then an easier path to access the database and download all the data. 

Either way, the system needs security hardening.. so.... whats the verdict? what was the UM it security guy getting paid? hahahahah or he just getting padi? ahahahahahahhaha. this is getting out of hand‚Ä¶.

Google it and you can see a prominent politician own the company. 

The level of most of these IT guys have a very basic understanding to operate the system and are lowly paid due to kroni getting most of profit. His account has been suspended on twitter... 1. By hacking the server and accessing the codes.

2. By a leak of the codes, especially via source code repo.

3. Bad server config, ie Apache mod PHP config that did not process the PHP file but rather the source itself

I also doubt that the Oracle database server is unsecured. While it could be, it‚Äôs just bad practice. If it‚Äôs secured, they probably accessed the web server and proxied their way to the database server for the data dump.. Still a hypothesis for now.",364.0,9,1,0

So china can please gtfo. I agree for that particular scene to be cut out but not release is kinda harsh isn‚Äôt it. well this is stupid.

just cut out the scene. It's cute that they think they can stop us from enjoying our entertainment by banning movies. All this does is tell me that I NEED to see what all the fuss is about. Yo ho, yo ho, it's a pirate's life for me! üíÄ ‚öî #GetWokeGoBroke. I get that China's being a prick with the South China Sea, but the movie getting banned over a damn **map**? What's the consequence of leaving it uncensored? The entire South China Sea implodes as all our territories get sucked into the black hole of China?. Ohh, the aussies are going down under alright. lol. Like china and winnie the pooh?. Dreamworks/China probably do not agree with the cut release so they ban it outright.. Sorry but at this point, extreme measures needs to be taken. This is a cancer and you don't go ""oh, it's just cancer. take some meds and you'll be fine."" You exterminate it with extreme prejudice. To explain my stand, this is due to china censorship slowly creeping into modern media. You know the term frog in hot water? Yeah, we are the frogs and china has been upping the temp. these past few years. We just start noticing it recently. So banning it completely will tell the companies that we don't want china suck ups. Banning it is the only way to make big corporations understand because it hurts them where it matters.. It's to prevent them from getting money. If we just censor the scene, the China studio still gets money and has more money to pump out propaganda, meaning more work for censors after that. Just watch other movies. Hopefully, the loss of income from 5 countries banning it simultaneously may persuade Dreamworks to stop kowtowing to China.

This isn't ""Calling Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh is bad"", which isn't our problem. This is ""China owns part of Malaysia"".. If china can ban some company due to individual talk bad about china, i dont see a reason why another foreign country do that tho?. It's just one movie. Censors aren't perfect. They banned it because they're not sure what other piece of China propaganda is included in the movie. Besides, if we censor the scene, the China studio still gets money and has more money to pump out propaganda, meaning more work for censors after that.

If the owners are bad people, why give money to them? Just watch other movies.

This isn't ""Calling Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh is bad"", which isn't our problem. This is ""China owns part of Malaysia"".. They were asked to and refused.. no u. It‚Äôs about principle. ÔøºChina is testing the water to see how far they can push us. By allowing China to propagandise their claim of our territory, they are one step closer in planting the seeds of dominance. They always play the long con, they don‚Äôt expect people to yield immediately. If we let them have their way this time, they will definitely do it again. 

The movie doesn‚Äôt look that good anyway. I also won‚Äôt be watching Mulan when it premieres. Time to torrent.. Dreamworks pulled out, not the Msia govt.. Kau baca article boleh tak bro?

The censorship board is okay as long as that nine-dash line map is removed. However, the distributor decided to pull out the movie from our market altogether.. Give an inch and they take a mile. Pretty sure there is an equivalent in your language too. To answer your question more directly, you know why china citizens believe in their great leaders? Because of indoctrination.

I don't know what the hell are you guys talking but I think it involve a woman who wants to speak to the manager..  after eating variations of fried rice/rice dishes in Skelleftea Sweden almost everyday for a few months, i thought to myself ""are our taste palates just different? or do malaysian really know how to cook friend rice?"" 

but truthfully the italian food and burgers in Sweden are killer, ugh i want to go back and eat dead animals. I know the feels, it‚Äôs like you know it‚Äôs not gonna taste the same and you know you are going to be disappointed, but you still ordered anyway simply because you miss home.. > you can take an Asian out of Asia but you can never get Asia out of the Asian.

Hmm I guess you're right.. eh not really... just found it funny haha. technically it's just the same as Malaysians learning how to make pastry in Paris, but I never expected that they actually go inside the mamak's kitchen.

also while I am not too well-versed on cultural appropriation, it's not like that they took the recipe and make it French or something. looked like they retained the original culture. sekali dia reply ""bishe bishe bossku"" in a french accent. I'd rather call them anne lol. i think last time (1 year ago) i ate ckt for rm5 at oug pasar malam, i dont eat ckt enough/much so maybe my memory/math lied to me (and you). In Kuching luckily still can find it, but the average is RM6-8 in my spottings.. there are almost no 24h places in France, even mcdonalds closes once. except football season. Boleh la? Boleh la~. Hahaha it sure is. Don't ever translate the second line though.. I think both. I found that I find it difficult to finish food if too spicy or too oily. Like I like it at first, but I just get tired eating and put it aside, I don't know our food might be just bland for you. üòÖ. And one lives in UK, another raised in Aus. ""Bisou bisou basque"". oh one year ago ok la, I thought still today haha. > No 24h McD

Hello US, this country needs freedom. Interesting. Because of the labour laws? Or just a cultural thing? Because there have to be jobs that have night shifts (security and the like), so it can't be that restaurants aren't allowed night shifts right?. Bolah belah!. 'our'? youre swedish then (ou Francaise)
one of the best simplest/cheapest dishes/side i had in france was onion soup, ugh killer where to get anywhere else, oh dear; i tried one onion soup in some fancy malaysian resto a while ago and absolutely didnt get anywhere to that taste i had in paris, stinky cheese? what is it? whats lacking? 
incidentally an italian friend/ex colleague complained that every(almost?) food in malaysia is overpowering (just flood it with chilli and sauce!), it is obvious to him dominos is not pizza at all, but when i tasted his subtle pizza and subtle pizza in athens a while ago i thought to myself ""omg i want to eat my shitty trashpop dominos pizza which is completely just full of 2/4 signature and easy three note neuronkilling catchy melodic synths"".

I meant our in broader terms as European üòÖ I don't like Domino's pizza at all but I like some pizza in Malaysia, but I do like some trash top pizza (Pezzo, PizzaKaw, PizzaHut) so I'm with you on that, though the cravings for Italian pizza come back sometimes.

This is the most fucked up thing which I keep hearing about Malaysia.

Petty thieves/rascals commit crimes, but the crowd around them pretends that **nothing happens**. 

Forget about chasing or confronting the criminal, people don't even bother to check on the victim !

An individual steal a bread,but there are some of this thread tried to made it about race,religion,stereotypes and politics. How about when an individual action is blamed upon that individual and not someone or something else that aren't related to said individuals and events.

Some said they aren't racist but because this action is done by an individual that from a particular race. The comments will be tinged more about tht race then the said individuals that actually done the deed.

Ps,meanwhile the one that reported to the police about this individual action is from that particular race.

I would not say that.  This is more of a case of a spoiled child without common decency.  This a common occurrence in the modern world due to both parents have to work just to get by.  This is one of consequences of making both parents work to afford expenses.  My father had 8 siblings in dirt poor rural Mississippi and they all turned out fine. Yeap, it's a cyclical thing.

did it? and the lack of reaction from the other people around. also out of nowhere? You don't see anything similar between this and numerous other incidents? You don't think it maybe a symptom of a much more serious underlying problem? one that maybe rapidly reaching a critical level?.

Being taught to see things from no bias view does that to ya. Media literacy and all that. 

Can't help to think with all the downvotes, that it might be a ploy of cheap publicity or some sort (for the video by that Kader Ibrahimz). Something like a match waiting to be lit under dry hay.

I don't expect them shocked Pikachu face mak cik to belasah that kid.. That‚Äôs a lot of questions man. There were 2 women and 4 kids. 2 guys on motorbikes came later after the fact. What reaction did you expect? Shock and self preservation are the norm in these situations. I'm only curious on the non-action of the 2 guys on the bike top right of the video. Probably saying fuck it we're not getting involved in this shit, so they quickly split.

In my old post history I told a story of how on the way back to LRT station I flying kicked a guy who was trying to mug a Chinese lady near Pasar Seni. There were a number of people there who witnessed it but didn't do anything. Heck, that woman didn't even thank me after I helped her gather her stuff from the floor. I got it. She was in shock and probably everyone there too. Maybe they were were stunned. Frozen. Plus that mugger had a knife, you'd think twice too to get involved.

No, I don't think there's any symptom nor is there anything similar compared to other incidents. What underlying problem? What critical level? I don't know what are you trying to imply here.

In the meantime, there's no need to get even here.. You can choose to rise above the VC or you can stoop to his level and spew the same kinda shit he did. Hate only attracts more hate..

3) VC says in his opening sentence ""Bukankah kuasa politik itu seharusnya milik kita"" . That is being a) political b) racist  
4) 4 of the biggest Universities in Malaysia held and organised the event...FOR WHAT?

Well, maybe if you were a mother of 2 instead of 4, you could overall afford to better feed your kids. What this country really needs isn't a nutrition scheme for the B40 group. It's family planning that should be a priority. This whole crazy idea of 'anak itu rezeki' has to stop and be replaced with 'mesti cukup rezeki baru ada anak'.. I was wondering how much wealth a nation have, is it unlimited or limited?


How the distribution of its effect the level of wealth and prosperity between the people?

And how the wealth and prosperity that all the people have effect the level of wealth a nation have?. fucc . iate this shit growing up, thinking we were poor as, nek minit my dad puts my name on inheritance worth more than 1 mil rm 20 years later. while the rich keeps getting richer. I agree. I went to one charity event that the penganjur do it once in 2 months at kawasan luar bandar. These poor people are just so happy getting their beras and tepung gandum, second hand clothing and even cheap free mugs. It makes me so touch and grateful with my life. 

It is really helpful it they can get basic stuff consistently.. no to food stamps. give more Br1m or BSH. let the guys choose what they want to buy. 

ppl who get food stamps, some sell them at a discount for money anyway.. I got into an argument with a coworker who truly believes that raising more children is good even under poverty, and whenever I questioned her on the finances of it all she resorted to the same NPC talking points of ""anak itu rezeki"" instead of defending her points.. Instead of immediately bashing this line of thought, I‚Äôd like to offer some form of understanding.

Banyak anak as rezeki is an old-age thinking from previous generations and needs updating. My grandparents both had up to eight siblings each, but that was a time when they were living in kampungs. Cost of living was somewhat manageable. Community bonds were strong and everyone kept an eye on each other‚Äôs children. Older siblings would take care of their younger ones. And older children who went out to work (usually in cities), would bring back good money and give it to their parents. Now multiply that money given by how many children they have.

My great-uncles or aunts would also financially support their younger siblings‚Äô education and sometimes, cost of living especially if they join their siblings in the same city.

To orang zaman dulu, children were a long-term investment and indeed, were viewed as rezeki. It‚Äôs just that this thought system isn‚Äôt applicable now given current urban, social and economic conditions.

Edit: added about siblings supporting each other financially.. If they dont have money for food, how would they have money to buy qlty family planning products. Then yr logic says that the RICH now should start to bang thier wife like rabbit lah. make more babies

Ok, Wife, ini malam tido dont pakai spenda... Always not sure what people want to go with when they raise this intuitively. Irrelevant.

Wealth begets wealth. Money makes more money. The poors are poor because they don‚Äôt have money. This sounds like a very garbage logic, but the number one cause of poverty is actually poverty. 

It isn‚Äôt the rich people‚Äôs fault actually. They contribute the most tax revenue, they consume the most in the society, they also employ the most employees. But somehow them being rich is a problem... not sure with this logic.

The rich getting rich isn‚Äôt the problem. The poors being still poor is the problem (of the economy and the government). We should be talking about how to uplift them, based on the notion abundance. Rather than implying the society doesn‚Äôt have enough to go around. 

Also paging to u/JenkinKhan it is impossible that the poors are paying more taxes. It is mathematically impossible. Rich always have a higher effective tax rate. They also earn a lot more. And as such taxed more in sheer RM terms.. The problem is not ""the rich"" but the government doing an absolute shit job at looking after the welfare of the poor (Not that I support a nanny state). It's basically the government's job to collect taxes (mostly coming from the rich) and use those funds to manage the country properly, which include helping the poor. It's also their job to regulate corporations from taking advantage of workers. The government and the politicians are ultimately the ones responsible.. And the poor get taxed more. I'm leery with giving money because I'm worried that some shops might hike up prices during that time of the month.. LOL some sell their food stamps for money therefore we should just straight up give them money great logic bro. i have hope though...my staff all see the same point of view as me after many years of lecturing ""its expensive to have kids""...none have more than 2....most have 1..im very suprised actually. I actually have the most kids among my 100% malay staff.. >NPC

Wow, that's a slur I never would've thought I'd see you use.. I am actually aware of this line of thought. But as you said, its an outmoded way of thinking and its something we need to change, which I also mentioned. Yet for some reason, every single govt we've had has balked at the idea of introducing family planning.. I'd add it isn't just malays, all races from earlier generations had big families. I have a dozen+ aunts and uncles. But my parents gen onwards most have 2 to 4 o M ly. I would rather we supply them the condoms than have to pay for their food/clothing/education for their kids.

&#x200B;

Cheaper in the long run. In fact, that should be the focus of the family planning campaign. We're only ever going to supply you with condoms. All other social aid for kids above the count of 2 are cancelled. Heck, 1 even if their household income is that low.. You have a pretty screwed up mind to draw that conclusion. There is a huge difference between ""don't have more kids than you can afford"" as compared to ""have as many kids as you can afford"". Difference is just a few words but the actual meaning differs greatly.. Woah a sensible and educated comment on economic reality? Here in Reddit? R/Malaysia color me impressed. 

The solution to poverty isn't too spread around the wealth, it's too generate more wealth. The rich get rich because they create value, create more value and you'll make more money.. Thank you. These leddit commies are insufferable.. while it's theoretically possible, but I don't think I have heard cases of it at all.... We shld do help them with both food and family planning, actually! It's done my international agencies in regions with extreme poverty and the resulting effect is so overwhelmingly positive. Poor people dont want 12 kids if they had a choice too yknw. 

Read up on developmental economics - it can help change your current (narrow) perspective on the matter. But but contraception is against God‚Äôs will! And it will encourage underage sex! /s. Like they say, everyone's a stinkin' commie until they grow older and start earning their own living and pay taxes.. Another argument would be, if the objective is ""ensure kids eat healthy food"", then targeted, food-based help might be better. If you give money, the parents might buy more food (in case of emergencies) that are not healthy, but cheap.. >if the objective is ""ensure kids eat healthy food"", then targeted, food-based help might be better

then mazlee *sarapan di sekolah* and in extension previous government *Rancangan Makanan Tambahan* and *Program Susu Sekolah* is already try to fulfilled that objective. however due to the lack of supervision the contractor may cut too much cost at the expense of serving actual nutritious food.. If I understand you correctly, you're thinking of food stamps but just for sayur and stuff? I think the bantuan buku fiasco is a perfect example how that would fail in Malaysia.

BSH/BR1M is fine on its own. can't beat rice when it comes to calorie/RM-convenience comparison. I suppose so; I have to admit that wealth-wise, I'm always privileged (not ""rich"" privilege, more like ""never had to eat nasi kicap"") so maybe things don't work the way I think it will in my head.. noble thoughts, but alas, the world is full of imperfection

128,Malaysiakini's worrying shift towards commercialisation,djji9o,2019-10-18 06:32:32,"This post may be downvoted like hell, but here goes....

I have nothing against Malaysiakini. I was one of the earliest subscriber when they put up a paywall and I still subscribe. And credit to Kini, which played a key role in toppling BN in last year's general election. The build-up took years, if not decades (the portal is two decades old this year).

But I sense a shift towards commercialisation. They even have a section called ""knowMYpalmoil"", alongside more conventional sections like ""Opinion"", ""Letters"" and ""Editors' Pick"". The Palm Oil bit is obviously a sponsored section. And I notice they tend to play up palm oil related news stories and feature Teresa Kok, the Primary Industries Minister.

And then, there is this survey: []( where those who takes part get one month free subscription of Kini. Kini even promoted the FB post on this survey, which is likely to be sponsored by Yeo Bee Yin's Ministry, or related agencies / parties.

Don't get me wrong. After decades of being victimised by the BN government, it's good that Kini now finds it easier to source for advertising revenue, whether from the government or corporations. Nothing oils any machineries like money, whether in hiring better journalists or expanding its scope or whatever. At the end of the day, it still boils down to ringgit and sen.

I am just a bit apprehensive if there's any ""firewall"" between its editorial and corporate divisions. If Teresa Kok or Yeo Bee Yin are caught in some scandal, just how independent would its editorial content be? Would there be any temptations to play up stories by Ministers, whose Ministries had bought ad space in the portal?

I bet if we were to sit its editor-in-chief Steven Gan down and ask him point blank about editorial independence, he'd give the standard drivel about impartiality yada yada yada. But the reality may not be so idealistic, if push comes to shove.

That said, it's not a problem that plagues Kini alone. All media around the world face the tug-of-war between editorial independence and commercial considerations. Even large ones like CNN. Or rather, ESPECIALLY large ones.

For me, it's just personally rather sad considering Malaysia's doyen of online news portal going down that road - which I guess was an inevitability.

Same thing happening with universities, hard to turn down research funding from ""unethical"" firms cos they are broke. You're not wrong, but I would say we should be giving them the benefit of the doubt for now.  


When they fail to be impartial...that's when we punish them by cancelling subscriptions.. Someone posted a similar topic awhile ago but the original post was deleted. Comments are still valid though. 

A rant about Malaysiakini's biased, bribed 'Know My Palm Oil' campaign  I read all newspaper online BH, MalayMail, FreeMalaysiaToday, BorneoPost, Bernama, Harakah, Mkini, etc.. I use Feedly to retrieve all sources. All paper have their own editor, they choose what they want to write. Don't just read from one sources. You are likely to have only one side of thinking if you do that.. Malaysiakini has always been a ridiculously biased source. Their brand of journalism has always been compromised by vested interests.

Is your concern that you don't want their content skewed to commercial interests over being Pakatan's regular propoganda mouthpiece?. At the end of the day Malaysiakini is a business, that means its priority is making money.. Not only is Malaysiakini bending to corporatisation via their KnowMyPalmOil crap, but also it's a worrying trend of English-speaking newspapers worldwide shifting from hard hitting journalism to Op-Eds as its main priority.

The Guardian and New York Times is guilty of this. [NYT's highest paid commentators like Bret Stephens is a climate change-denying goon]( while [many journalists worldwide are struggling to get paid]( Holy.... there's an awful lot of money.. I would think most of it would go to foreign countries since I haven't met any Malaysian that was anti palm oil. I guess we just gotta wait for Malaysiakini 2.0 to emerge when the time comes.... People have to realise that the media is a business. In a ideal world the media would be unbiased and report the news as is, but in the real world... Well, money speaks. 

Plus, let's not forget that the fourth estate are people - they'll have opinions and viewpoints. They may strive to be impartial, but their thoughts are going to color what they report. That's just being human.

Btw, I have a whole paranormal story to tell related to that aunt of mine if you nyets wanna read haha. saka. you know lah how its like during ww2. everybody wants some protection. anyways, already discard it somewhere in the jungle.. When i moved in to my new house, our maid complained to me that she have been having nightmare every night. When she woke up in the middle of the night, she can hear scratching sound behind the wall to her room. 

Her work was effected because of lack of sleep. So i read about how to get rid of it. Basically all i did was Recite some prayer (forgot which surah in the quran) over water and basically sprayed said water around the house. 

Next morning she said she was able to sleep soundly throughout the night. No more interruptions. Even when she woke up in the middle of the night.

Few week after that I heard the neighbor‚Äôs children saw tall shadowy figures when they were playing at night on the street across my house. Well, not my problem no mo.... Try to reflect on religious practices you and your parents do that your grandma doesn't normally participate in (there must be something, even as benign as everyone reciting prayers before meals) and does your grandma tolerate it without complaint or does she make you and your parents stop? 

Give her the same courtesy.. My parents don't actually do any of that stuff, despite being conservative Malays. The only ""magic"" thing they did is to make us drink zamzam water occasionally. 

The other branches of my family tho, especially the ones that live in Kelantan.... Not entirely sure about this but when my family move to a new house, lots of weird things happen usually nightmares. But one thing i notice was the sound of marble, dropping from a high place. I heard it almost everyday and it always sounded the same. One day my parent decide to invite people for kenduri pindah rumah and that was last time i heard that sound. Pretty eerie but im not sure if it's spiritual or just sound from pipes. The rule of thumb for me is to always ask whether is there any Quranic and authentic Hadith to support such treatment, if not better to stay away since syirik is One of the unpardonable sin in Islam.

It's difficult to refuse family, but as Muslims we have to keep our Iman strong in order to preserve our faith. Hope this helps op.. I assume you're a Malay? 
You got to pick, whether you want the be a Malay, Malay Muslim, or a Muslim. The first follow you ancestor's practise, also includes biar mati agama jangan mati adat. The second is somewhere in between, maybe follow some of the adat, break some of the adat, follow some of the syariah, break some of the syariah. The third is don't break the syariah and live your life as you want. The choices will shape your mindset on how you see things and how you deal with it.. Saka, bred by my great great grandma. After she died some family members got sick and we started blaming it. 99% sure those are just regular sickness, we are just too poor for checkups and my family too conservative to believe modern doctors. I don't really believe supernatural shits so I never experience it.. I just pretend they does not exist. It does not have any impact in my life but I am pretty sure the people around me had some sort of Bomohism in their life. Because of my work I do see a lot of different rituals normal people does not see. Old dying  traditions, ancient practice, animism and Khurafat stuffs. I just treat them as work and not having any opinions about them, as long as they pay me. I've seen things flying sort of black magic stuffs and still i just don't have any opinion and just ignoring them. I've seen shaman calling the dead and spirits taken over their body.. I have so many stories. From saka to sihir. And it happened to me personally.. Are there any books on Malaysia black magic? I feel that this is important part of Malay history and culture.. Garam Kasar, Kerak besi are things that these Otherly beings hate. 

Rukyah is fine, but Bomoh..ahaha. not for me. Hd personal  experience.. Bad.Bad.. 

and nope im.quite sure it wasnt schizophrenic, - Lol.. Welp since u said u have a story, do tell!. I'm a nyet and i wanna read.. Agree with this. Ruqyah by itself is ok, since it uses Quranic verses. But anything other than this? Bomoh stuff, even if it's scattered with Quranic verses, is not permissible.

  


My grandparents practiced these bomoh stuff. Not good man. It makes you paranoid and you tend to suspect (usually innocent) people. Then you wanna get back at those people without having any concrete proof. It destroys relationships.. Saka is best explained as the old Malay explanation for schizophrenia, as it is 1) hereditary and 2) causes symptoms such as hallucinations, incoherent thoughts, and memory deficits.

Mind you, the presence of schizophrenia and other forms of mental illness can be exacerbated by the high rate of inbreeding occuring in Kampungs, combined with the lack of macronutrients in their diet.. Do tell us which verse once u can recall it. It might be useful for us. You have piqued my interest. Care to share a lil' more?. Zamzam at least has its roots in tradition and the Quran.. I hear the same thing in my parents house every night. I read that it's something to do with water pipes as well which makes sense since it's an apartment.. I'm fine with my identity as a Malay Muslim really but it's just that I'm not interested in involving myself with her ruqyahs and all. I'll still follow obligatory duties but ruqyah? Nah, I wouldn't do that really.. but doctor visits are heavily subsidised... Care to share?. Yeah, like Djinn are actually similar beings like Shantae the half Genie hero, or Genie from Aladdin.. Haha maybe ill write it up and post on r/Paranormal first. Well that's the priority of syaitan (djinns), to breakup relationships and the ummah. Wish my parents could agree to this. I always sees it as a mental illness, whenever my mom gets ‚Äòpossessed‚Äô by some spirit that she claimed our bomoh ancestor has sent to haunt us. It‚Äôs a horrifying sight to see her switching from my mother to a shrieking bloodshot eyed horror, it takes sometimes hours to snap her out of it. I tried to convince her to see a therapist but she refuse, attributing her condition to spiritual issue. Unfortunately my stepfather agrees with her and doesn‚Äôt completely support my plea to get her professional help. What they did is to remedy this is to pray more and harder. 

I don‚Äôt believe in hocus pocus and I don‚Äôt practice Islam. I hate religion as a result and spent most of my time away from home, lying to everyone and myself included that I just want to look for better jobs while the reality is I just don‚Äôt want to deal with things that breaks my heart and I have no control over.. I've suspected for a while that these supernatural experiences might actually be symptoms of schizophrenia. My grandparents, 2/3 of their children, and some of their grandchildren (my cousins) either have visual or auditory hallucinations. I mean, how else do you explain seeing and hearing things that nobody else does?. Well one of my parents worked for a hospital, so I guess we don't really need traditional ""medicine"" :D. maybe it is your neighbour living above your apartment? Like I can hear stomping sounds if they run, hear furniture moving.. It should be simple, if there's no explanation, guidance or notes from the Quran itself, or sunnah, you can just reject it.. Share a link on this sub as well if you do.. New stuff? Yeaaaa man! Was it your daughters......?. This is sad for your mother.. Medicine and therapy is readily available (and cheap!) in 2019, there's no reason for her to suffer like that. she can pray and go to the doctor at the same time... It sucks when you don't get support from your loved ones. While I believe in these saka things, I also don't rule out mental illness as a possible trigger.

  


My sister was possessed when she was in college, and she also had problems with anxiety and depression. Thank god my mom took her to a psychiatrist and she got prescribed some medication. My father still doesn't believe in mental health issues though. He always believes that all the possessions and her acting up are just the doings of jinns. Even when my brother attempted suicide, my father still believed that was the work of jinns.

  


His solution was just for them to be ""stronger"". Very not helpful to have such a parent. Thank god for my mom and her unending support.. Let's face it,  what kind of kid plays with marbles in 2015 in the middle of the night?. Hehe no, just around my aunt who went through a lot of possessions before becoming a bomoh herself... It's the sound of water pipes contracting, I hear that in my old house as well. No idea whether it's similar to the ticking sound a car engine makes when it cools down",1728.0,13,175,0

Such epic facedesk.... TIL UM vcs are a bunch of petulant, fragile snowflakes. The guy aiming for career in politics izzit?.

Are this fella immune to any punishment and can straight away got the second chance?. If that's the case half of the lecturers in all Public/Private universities would be out of jobs.

Dropped in to their admissions office and after 10 mins of speaking to the representative, I wanted to walk out the door. (Had NO CLUE what she was doing)

Hence to why i rather ask the alumi or current students, how did you apply and the requirements and was it up to your standards?

Thanks!",3,0.73,2.0,"You need to provide more information. Why do you think she is clueless of her job?

I think IMU produces one of the more competent group of graduates. Most of the housemen from IMU exhibit very strong leadership from what I have seen. They tend to outperform many local medical school graduates. Knowledge wise, they might be above average but when it comes to soft skills, people skill, practical skills, communication skills and confidence, they have everyone beat.. I totally get what you mean, I have been aiming for IMU since i started my diploma course and want to continue with them as long as I can as I've also heard alot of great things about them and also all my lecturers highly recommended it to!

The admin lady who was talking to me explained that there is a possibility I might not be able to enrol in their degree course with my current diploma in Psychology eventho with a 3.0 GPA and IELTS English requirements but with 6 yr old spm results instead which bamboozled me üòÇ. 

So I asked if I used my SPM results am i still eligible? She said not really due to my maths being an E which she said I m still able to if my diploma had a mathematical based subject so I pointed out statistics which i was taught with using a calculator and a pencil than good old SPSS (comp program for stats) she say not sure. And on top of that I have to go sign up to take MUET/TOEFL/IELTS?

Every question I asked her made less sense to i gave up, thanked her for her time and a list of required documentations for her to go through for my eligibility of entry. Scanned through the minimum requirements brochure to find out she misunderstood a bit.

The minimum requirements said that what they asked will not be needed for diploma in Psychology holders jst follow CGPA while the version she told me was I must follow EVEN WITH a diploma in Psychology.

Going to try and call up again on monday and ask if i can get a different rep to talk too than the lady I've met, i even asked her if i could have a campus tour which she said yes let me find someone and than after that goodbye without finding someone and I had no premission to walk around myself so jst took the train home.",405.0,8,72,0

r/Malaysia **Discord Drawpile 17: Spooky Deepavali Edition**

&#x200B;

The Festival of Lights will soon be upon us to banish all the spookiness of Spooktober, and to commemorate this the r/Malaysia Discord server will hold an unusual joint Deepavali-Halloween Drawpile this 25th October 2019. So don your best sari and witch hat as we celebrate Malaysia's Hindu and Indian community, as well as partake in some Halloween fun.

Drawpile is an [/r/place]( like program that allows people, regardless of artistic skill (or lack thereof), to draw on a shared canvas. The program can be downloaded here: []( If you're on the Discord server, feel free to react to the Drawpile role üé® in **#peranan** to get pinged for the latest Drawpile news and sessions.

&#x200B;

**servername:** r/malaysia drawpile 17

**password:** spookyvali

**date and time:** 25 October 2019, 9 pm

&#x200B;

\*Please note that the current version of Drawpile (as of this announcement) is 2.1.11, released on 23 June 2019. Updating the program is encouraged.

**Things to take note:**

‚Ä¢Please be considerate and conserve space! The canvas size may vary between Drawpile sessions but what is certain is that there'll be enough room for everyone's drawings. When the canvas is filled up, the canvas might be expanded at the moderators' discretion. (please also bear in mind that when the canvas is expanding, most users will experience extreme lag so be prepared for that)

‚Ä¢Drawpile is very memory heavy, so expect lags as the canvas fills up.

‚Ä¢Please don't draw over other people's drawings without their consent.

‚Ä¢If you are adding text using the annotation tool, they need to be merged into the layer. Otherwise, it won't show up in the final picture!

‚Ä¢Keeps things civil and safe-for-work. Bigotry, vulgar drawings, and hate symbols are not allowed and will be erased by the moderators. Please do not also grief/troll. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.

&#x200B;

**Auto-resets and second sessions:**

‚Ä¢The auto-reset limit for the [r/Malaysia]( Discord Drawpiles is set to around 45.0 mb. Should the auto-resets become too frequent, the mods will disable it.

‚Ä¢Drawpile has a hard limit of 50 mb before the canvas breaks. Once the canvas reaches close to 50 mb and the auto-resets can no longer decrease the memory below the hard limit, the canvas will be locked by the session's mods.

‚Ä¢Second sessions will be created if the hard limit problem arises. Please wait patiently while a mod sets up a second session (which should normally follow a naming convention of '[r/malaysia]( drawpile # Session 2'). The drawings and layers of the first session will be carried over to the second session, albeit in a compressed state due to the need to open up space.

134,Advice for a young aussie travelling,djip5c,2019-10-18 05:06:00,"Hello beautiful people

I‚Äôm a young man travelling to Malaysia solo in December. I am flying into KL where I will spend a few days wandering the city and partying as hard as I can. 

After that I intend to leave the city and see the country at a relaxing pace. Like most aussie‚Äôs I enjoy beaches and beer. I like old buildings and history. 

If you were in my shoes where would you go? 

What are the absolutely ‚ÄòMust-do‚Äô things while I‚Äôm there and what general advice will help me enjoy my trip with the least hassle?

I‚Äôm keen as 

Thanks!",7,0.68,9.0,"beach/beer/old buildings/history...you are in the wrong city...head up north to Penang. Its a UNESCO heritage zone with everything you want. Keen as - kiwi in disguise?

Hit up trec. No beaches around KL that will be party-worthy. 

If you could fly to phuket/krabi and take a boat to ko phi phi, it's the best beach party I've ever been to. Lots of beachy things to do too, diving and etc.. KLCC bridge walk offers a scenic view through the horizon.   
Party in the sky by the pool on roof of Traders Hotel next to KLCC. 

Merdeka Square also offers the view of Sultan Abdul Samad building which is on the MYR currency notes.   
near by is Central Market offers local works of art   
evening at Petaling Street bazaar. 

If you are interested in the finest pewter in the world, visit Selangor Pewter   
Lunch on authentic Malay cuisine at Warisan Cafe at The Royal Chulan, in Bukit Bintang.   
Ride hailing to world class chocolate, Harriston Signature Boutique at Ampang or Cheras. 

If your trip in KL is not satisfying the head down to The Beach Club at Jalan P.Ramlee where you can bitch about it.   


Out of KL, I recommend Redang island or Pangkor island if you like to party.. Most of the popular and good looking beaches (with beer) in Malaysia are on island resorts on the East Cost of Peninsular, or around East Malaysia (Sabah). Look for Tioman, Redang, and Perhentian island for East Coast islands. There's also a few mainland beach resorts nearby those islands too.

There are a few spots in in the Northern part of the West Coast of Malaysia with good looking beaches. Lumut has a few beach resorts. Langkawi island has them too (with cheap alcohol). Penang island also has a few good beach resorts and bars.. dont use public toilets. Find a mall toilet.. There are plenty bars and clubs in KL, but do note that alcohols are highly taxed here, so better ready some extra money for that. If you want to party, there are a few clubs, but the only known club I know is Zouk. There are a few old buildings in KL, but not all of them are very historical and not a beautiful sight to see. Notable old buildings in KL is the Jamek Mosque, Dataran Merdeka and Pasar Seni (you can find souvenirs here too if you're interested). I would also recommend visiting the museum to learn history of Malaysia as well. In terms of beaches, you need to go a bit far which is Port Dickson. 

Must-do things:

\- When you arrived at the airport, take the airport taxi instead of those metered taxis. They charged fixed RM60 from airport to hotel. Metered taxis tend to be more expensive. Ask the taxi driver's phone number if you need him/her to bookand send you back to the airport.

\- Download Grab ( Malaysian Uber app). They offer good fixed taxi prices and worry- free compared to old taxis. You can choose to pay in cash or credit card. Grab taxi drivers are quite friendly as you can either talk to them or just sit quiet at the back without blaring music from the car's radio.

\- If your hotel happen to be close to any train stations, take advantage of it. Download yourself the train map of Kuala Lumpur, or use Google Maps using walking mode.

\- Mamak restaurants are plenty and they are cheap. You can find from local food to western food. They serve good teh tarik ( a milk tea) and Milo ( hot chocolate), but they don't serve alcohol or pork.

&#x200B;

Things to note:

\- Careful of strangers around that seems very scary to you as you don't wanna bump into them and cause trouble. 

\- Malaysia's toilets use mostly water, so if you're used to toilet papers, you can buy from the convenient store.

\- If you wanna find alcohol, certain convenient stores do sell. Also some high class shopping malls has a designated liquor store. 

\- Wanna wine and dine but don't wanna break the bank, Chinese restaurants are the way to go.

\- Be cautious on taxis (those red and white ones), some might be old and undermaintained, and sometimes the taxi driver can rip you off with high price especially to foreigners.

\- Never shy to ask for directions. We locals are welcome to help.

\- Pasar malam (nightmarkets) can be available near your hotel, so do look out to find some cheap food.

\- Since you are traveling alone, do more research and study the map a little on the areas you wanna visit around, especially around your hotel. 

\- Free wifi is available on most shopping malls and cafes like starbucks and coffee bean. Even McDonald's have them. Oh yeah, some mamak restaurants do also have wifi. unless you happen  to purchase a sim card. 

&#x200B;

135,University student probed for protest while paedophile gets second chance.,dji7rv,2019-10-18 04:19:24,notexthere,99,0.9,109.0,"Full article anyone, stuck with paywall... check out UM law society press statement.. race aside....

why the hell there are still paedo apologists around?. Don't let all this noise take attention away from the main issue here: why was the Malay Dignity Congress allowed in the first place? Why isn't there an investigation into the firebrand, racist, inciteful speeches that were made during the event?

Whatever side of the political divide you are on, can we at least agree that racism is becoming more rampant, particularly this new (well not really new) brand of Malay ultra nationalism? Can we also agree that something needs to be done before things get worse?. right religion and skin colour means can get away with a lot. The fact he was charged by the police for ""intentional insult to provoke a breach of peace"" is laughable because what insult did he do that will cause a disruption in peace? He's just one guy, with a place card.. Such is the nature of men in a caste system. Those who offend the upper echelons are exiled regardless of their invaluable deeds.. How i wished the UM protestor had convinced a non cinababi fren to protest with him alongside....it would have really changed the narrative and discussion about this issue.  

&#x200B;

less of the ""bangsa DAP biadap"" nonsense now. i was dumb enough to check the comment section of articles posted about this and i saw many people of a certain race (although there were a few of other races chiming in, but those were very little in comparison) attacking the protestor for being rude for protesting at the convo, while completely ignoring what the VC did. I felt a bit sad on how this issue has turned out to be.. Here's the alleged speech @2:22:28 

Entire speech is ok, but the opening ""Bukankah kuasa politik itu seharusnya milik kita"" is the only inciteful sentence.. WHAT THE \*guitar screech\* IS WRONG WITH MALAYSIA RIGHT NOW?!!! HOW ON EARTH PEDOWH\*RES GET SECOND CHANCES WHILE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE NOT?!!! PEDOWH\*RES ARE JUST THE WORST DIGNITY POLLUTANTS IN THE SOCIETY NOWADAYS!!! \*guitar screech\* THEM ALL AND HELL CAN \*guitar screech\* THEIR \*guitar screech\* NOW!!! üò°. Mahathir will right the wrong, he is a changed man. He loves Malaysia, together with DAP, Mahathir and Kit Siang will make Malaysia a better place. This is all because of 1MDB, Najib and Rosmah's fault, they left this mess. Long live Mahathir..  

**Scenario 1:** 

Nur Fitri Azmeer Nordin, a 23-year-old Malaysian MARA scholarship student who was studying in Imperial College, United Kingdom, was caught with more than 30,000 photographs and videos of child pornography.¬†

Advertisement

He was then sentenced to 5 years in prison. Aside from the possession of these materials, the British authorities also said he had intent to distribute it.

After serving a reduced sentence from 18 months to nine in a British prison, Nur Fitri was extradited back to Malaysia.¬†

Now, it is reported that he is studying for his PhD in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. What did the authorities and government say?¬†

That he deserves a second chance because he is smart, will have a bright future plus he served his sentence and should be allowed to study.

**Scenario 2:**

Wong Kan Ye, a 23-year-old Malaysian student who studied civil engineering at University Malaya, had held up a yellow sign during his convocation that stated *‚ÄòTolak Rasis‚Äô* and *‚ÄòUndur VC*‚Äô (Reject racism and VC withdraw your statements).

This was in valid protest against UM Vice-Chancelor Datuk Abdul Rahim Hashim (and the univeristy) for failing to promote racial tolerance and unity by being a part the Malay Dignity Congress.

The university made a police report to investigate Wong Kan Ye for tarnishing the university‚Äôs image and disrupting convocation protocols.¬†

He was interrogated by the police for one hour and now, the university has not presented Wong with his graduation scroll.¬†

The university proceeded to also bar another student, Edan Kon, from his convocation the next day.

Who actually has a brighter future and should be given a second chance?¬†

A convicted paedophile sex offender or a university graduate who has not even committed a crime?¬†

What‚Äôs the deal here Malaysia? It seems that the priorities we have are a little bit skewed and perverted.

We are okay for a sex offender to repent after being convicted with a serious crime (the government does not even have him registered as a sex offender), but we are not okay for a university student to practice his freedom of speech by protesting non-violently against racism.

And we‚Äôre supposed to be a country of democracy.

Our Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, when asked to comment about Wong‚Äôs protest stated that the UM convocation was the wrong place for him to protest because it could have led to chaos.¬†

This is very disappointing because, as far as I can recall, Dr. Mahathir (above) was part of a much bigger protest a few years back that really disrupted and caused ‚Äòchaos‚Äô on a weekend (it was *Bersih*, in case you don‚Äôt remember).

Of all people, the Prime Minister should know that protests and demonstrations are suppossed to be disruptive and cause chaos.¬†

The objective for that is so that people will pay attention and take heed when all other methods fail.¬†

Would the matter regarding racism receive as much attention if Wong had not chosen to do what he did? Of course not.

Education Minister Maszlee Malik needs to say something about this too.¬†

I know his ideals and he has always been an encouraging party when it comes to the youth and students being the voice of dissent.¬†

He allowed student protestors to demonstrate in front of his ministry‚Äôs lobby a few months back. He has also met with student protestors for dialogues before.

Today, we have a government that that consists of so many people who were the voice of dissent.¬†

I have seen with my own eyes (and documented by my camera) of current Cabinet members who use to yell into loud hailers calling for disruptive protests and demonstrations.¬†

They have also been sprayed with water jets, shot at with tear gas and, of course, arrested.

So they cannot say to the public now that protests and demonstrations can only happen at the right time and at the right place.¬†

That would be very hypocritical of them to do so. Weigh in the severity of what Wong did.¬†

Nothing detrimental (much less violent) came out of what he did that affected the public in any negative way.

The only thing that did come out of it was that the vice-chancelor and the university were butt-hurt and had their feelings (ie: ego) damaged with what he did.¬†

But anyway, it‚Äôs like what Malaysians like to say, ‚Äú*Siapa makan cili, dia yang rasa pedas*!‚Äù.¬†

Am I right, or am I right?

 Bcos some dude thinks that it‚Äôs nothing.. and i had a fight with some incel who thinks if a child have period early 10/11, they are capable to get married.. Islam allows underage marriages.. If your own kind gets prosecuted it is only natural to march to their defense.

&#x200B;

Edit: I guess it took me a while to notice this, and I apologize to the people who have their feathers ruffled. When I said ""their kind"", I was referring to pedophiles, not race. And here I was wondering which pedo downvoted me.. I guess the argument in this particular case is that there isn't any evidence he actually abused children himself, or caused children to be abused so there isn't an easily identifiable victim per se. So while he shouldn't be allowed to work with children, you can argue it is better to rehabilitate him and give him an opportunity to turn things around by treating it as a mental illness to be treated rather than something to lock him up long term for. 

We don't have the details of the case to be sure, I don't know if the Malaysian safeguarding system for organisations that work with children is able to reliably bar him from ever doing so, and I don't know if he will receive actual effective treatment to help him change.. The main question is why was UM one of the event organisers? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Pelik jugak. Tapi tulah. Everyone nak a name for themself. Semua nak tinggalkan LeGaSi.. Since you‚Äôre in the top comment I‚Äôm gonna quote another user said;

> Such is the nature of men in a caste system. Those who offend the upper echelons are exiled regardless of their invaluable deeds. u/infernoShield

If the protester is a Malay Muslim, they are still going to get the same outcome for ‚Äúattacking‚Äù the uni‚Äôs upper management. We‚Äôve seen this before.

It‚Äôs just not a fair comparison between the pedo and this protesting student. Those 2 scenarios are completely different whatsoever. To compare it just because one is Malay and another is Chinese is only going to make people‚Äôs blood boil, causing further separation between races. 

And sadly that has been the case in this comment section. Which is against what Wong Kan Ye is fighting for.. [This kid]( had the right religion and skin colour but still his diploma got suspended for 2 years for pulling a similar stunt. Before you get pedantic, similar stunt here refers to that unconventional action on the stage.

I guess you're wrong about that part about right religion and colour eh?. not really in his case, he pissed the VC...the VC of his university...its like calling your racist ex-boss racist and he fired you, it does ot matter what race you are, what matter is you pissed the easily triggered racist boss.

Edit:lol people dont know what an analogy is?. I was thinking to myself if Wong Yan Ke can be charged with this law can the VC be charged with the same thing? Because what the VC did is exactly that and he successfully provoke people including Wong Yan Ke and breach public peace in this case the convocation at UM.. Because our 'leaders' are anything but.. This.

It‚Äôs not a comparison between the two scenarios. They are completely different. They just happen to be Malay and Chinese. Clickbait comparison and sadly people fall for it. 

We have seen Malay students get barred or exiled for protesting against the upper management of their university. Now compare with that.. But well, when they are attacking him for who he is and how he did rather than his message, it has already made a point.. A lot of my non cinababi friends do not actually condemn the protest but condemn his intention to disrupt the convocation. IDK to me if he'd just protest  outside of DTC and not doing any unnecessary things during the convocation then it wouldn't have been that big of issue. Sincerely from a student of UM. Urrmmm, excuse me. Are you implying people would not condemn the protest just because a non-Cinababi protest with him?

In case you missed the buzz, [this non-Cinababi made ruckus at police station and still get condemned.](

And during Cameron Highland PRK, [a non-Cinababi DAP deputy minister went berserk because 'kantoi' using gov'ment property during campaign.](

So memang proven kan bangsa DAP bangsa biadap.. At this point you're just saying the same shit without effort whatsoever with little relevance to the topic at hand. You forgot your /s. I understand, and appreciate your brand of satire.. Because you just need to be the right skin colour and follow the right religion. Then you will be absolved of ALL your sins. Dirty infidels can just die in the streets. Remember ""Balik cina""? Remember the 13th of May, 1969?. So when you protest, you jump inside your parent bedroom and kick everything in sight and your parent will do what? ""it ok he just a shitty brat, dont need to punish him""

Freedom of speech doesn't free you from consequence, you can protest but bear the consequence without whining. Next time jump on a park.. He served his time (5 years) as a punishment, then only he got second chance. 

Has this guy being punished? Before he can get second chance, as you mentioned above.

Where is the equality in those cases? Second chance without punishment?. Nice. Puts UM in different light if it's law department students actually articulate and know the law. Really great, pretty unbiased write up. I was disappointed to see so many people petition for his degree to be revoked and I hope those people read this write up with an open mind.. But they don‚Äôt allow child porn, or any kind of porn really.. I don‚Äôt. I fucking hate that Malay student for his unspeakable behaviour. He deserved to be in jail and he needs mental help. And a lot of Malay Muslims feels the same as me.. urm....NOPE.

I am disappointed if you have that kind of mindset, and it sounds too xenophobic for my own liking.. That‚Äôs definitely the wrong way of thinking about things. If deplorable acts are committed, regardless of ethnicity or religion, they should be condemned. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Excusing someone just because they‚Äôre the same ethnicity or religion as you is as good as supporting their deplorable acts.. > guess the argument in this particular case is that there isn't any evidence he actually abused children himself, or caused children to be abused so there isn't an easily identifiable victim per se.

that is BS...he had thousands of highest grade child porn...ie babies being raped. Ppl produce these vids to sell to assholes like him. There are countless victims. Yeah I think people just want him to rot in prison or hanged. Anything else is unacceptable for most.

Pretty sad as he did his sentence and did not touch kids. We have convicted murderers and rapist who did their time. Should we sent them back to prison or stop them from working/studying?

But I guess I'm an apologist for saying this. Some greedy upper class people are like this: offending them means big trouble.. VC isnt the boss of the Uni. Waaaaait are students being paid to take a degree? No? the VC isn't his boss.. except this is a public university... and he isn't actually the boss. That's why it's laughable. Double standard. Still the same mentality, how can the country grow?. > U might wanna share a link with full article. Not everyone subscribes.

are you encouraging people to steal content?. i have no idea the point  you trying to make. My point is ..because he is chinese, most of the attacks are currently because of his race..not his act. just go to any malay medium SM and news sites. I think the point he's trying to make is that the previous regime and now also same same different action between the pedo and the protestor.. but it is?

*because apparently the narrative now is to blame the VC and UM for the Malay Dignity Congress but are too scared to go after the party or person that actually organized it.*

*people are desperate to find someone to blame yet they cant do it cuz takut dgn their boss which is in the government*. Which side are you on? If you support Wong Kan Ye, why are you shit stirring and separating people? That‚Äôs the opposite of what he‚Äôs fighting for.. he isnt whining. ppl are condemning UM response to a young man protesting. Lodging a police report?? Withholding his cert??. Spotted the pedophile. Besides, if voicing a valid concern is punishable then you should be jailed for a comment like yours.. Check your facts, he only served 9 months of his sentence.. he was caught with thousands of the highest grade child porn. ie...rape of babies and other disgusting videos. You are comparing that...to a grad that is protesting a racist?. Who needs child porn when you can actually fuck them? - Muslim pedo apologist.. a lot of ""liberals"", I guess?

Iuno...I still have faith in us Malaysians, but those apologists make me scared.. If you judge just with a sentence, then I have bad news for you my friend.. I 100% percent agree with you. But unfortunately, we live in the real world. And even the blind can see what's going on.. Well duh...its an analogy...what you think I say? he is the boss and the student is his employee? Lol wtf.... Ye duh? Its an analogy! The vc is influential and powerful did you not get it? The student is pissing off powerful people, he is not just a VC he is part of the elite circle jerk, the boss is an analogy to the power the dude hold, the student being the employee being the analogy of how helpless he is...Wow people...or is it because I do not agree with dur hur it because of race race race( so much for fuck racism huh?)....even thou its clearly caused by some elite being easily triggered. Well duh? When someone say  dotdotdot is as big as a football field do they talk about fooball field? Do you not know what an analogy is? Like bloody hell?. It's never gonna grow, last I checked. Yes, yes Malaysia is trash while everywhere else people act in an absolute civil manner /s

[](

And I am pretty sure if he did the same thing in Singapore (against the govt), straight to jail. And if he has good connections, he will be able to get off with a warning (same with anywhere else in the world). Growth of the country has nothing to do with civil liberties last I checked. China is fast becoming the world's biggest economy not based on her respect of human rights.. i can't detect if that is a sarcasm, or you really don't know you can share links.....in reddit.. >most of the attacks are currently because of his race..not his act

like what muslim and kelantanese was portrayed in this sub lmao. >too scared to go after the party or person that actually organized it.

uh....The Malay Dignity Congress is organised by the UM, UPSI, UiTM and UPM.. Ahh here we go again. I suggest you educate yourself properly before saying anything more. And like most other complex things, there is no straight answer to everything, if you can comprehend it that is.. Likewise, my friend.

P/s: didn't downvote you. and we are telling you that its a bad analogy. You can either accept it..or continue to try to defend your bad analogy. The difference is that kid paid to study there so... that VC is actually the employee.. Oooh you are doing a timun and durian analogy. Still makes no sense? Boss implies certain relations which includes financial compensation, and in this case the money goes the other way.. there are good analogies, and there are bad analogies. I'm merely pointing out the hypocrisy of the authority's action. What's the need to mention and  compare the economy growth and civil rights of other countries?. If you like comparing us to singapore so much why don't you move there? Not saying other countries are better. Just that ours NEED to do better.. wut?.

I think the problem is that you only see hate and are blinded by positivity.. Do you understand the difference between the words: race, religion and region?. in response to the aftermath of the PAS UMNO Himpunan Ummah, are you sure its not Mahathir?. I was a Muslim for 20 years of my life. I'm pretty sure women can marry when they reach puberty. Thats why Mo married Aishah and fucked her as a child..

""Elephant fight grass suffer"" need to be somewhat about an animal fight /s. the VC is a powerful dude surrounded by powerful circle jerk meanwhile the student is just a normal dude with literally no power...so yeah boss being powerful and employee being powerless is not that far off...so do tell me why this is bad? Because I do not talk about race?. well to be fair aside from the few potshots here and there this sub is relatively peaceful lately.. and attack by merit of religion and region is totally fine üëåüëåüëå. did you meant to say ""who masterminded the event"" instead of ""who organised it""?

I dunno if it's DRM but his entire 1 hour speech is basically the same old rhetoric; melayu malas tak mau buat kerja susah suka jual tanah.. > I was a Muslim for 20 years of my life. I'm pretty sure women can marry when they reach puberty.

(X) Doubt

So you‚Äôre playing the woke ex-Muslim card.

Then if you‚Äôre Muslim you would also know that at that time things are very different. It has been told time and time again that Aishah (and girls that age) was very mature compared to today‚Äôs time. Puberty in Islam is more about the girl‚Äôs mental and intellectual maturity than physical maturity.. The whole uproar that was created by this kinda does show that isn't the case. 1. VC is not his boss (no matter how many times you want to say so)

2. Your feudal mentality is showing. lately? It has always been this way... Way back, there are even more heated religious debate than now but nothing remotely vile or insultful. We make fun of singaporeans and indonesia every day of the week but does that constitute to ""hate""?

Just show me 1 example of a highly upvoted and the most hateful comment you've seen regarding malay/muslims.

poking fun is not hate, asking for the death of homosexual is. Don't conflate.. OP is particularly free today I think. Hehehe. Religion is a set of ideas. Followers of a religion adhere to these ideas and sometimes make actions based on them. Religion is not free from criticism. Contrary to your religious beliefs, the free world does not adhere to religious blasphemy laws. Definitely not the internet.

Once again on display here, we see how Islam is incompatible with the concept of a liberal, free society. I'm just waiting for you people to push the West over the boiling point and start shit.

Penang bad driver lul = tak boleh kutuk? Or is it only Kelantan you triggered af?. Heh I once said that men can be a rape and sexual harrasment victim too and get downvote to oblivion, do that make the downvoters right and I am wrong? If the will of majority is all it take to make something ""right"" then I am glad to be wrong.. Lol clearly you dont understand what an analogy is, here another analogy: 

2 wolrd power duking each other

M: Elephant fight grass suffer

N: its not a fight between 2 animals or grass for that matter

M:its an analogy

N: its a fight between 2 super power,   and the parties are made up of HUMAN not ElEPHANT

M: the elephant and grass are an analogy

N: Its a fight between countries between HUMANS! Your PETA support is showing. i wish i could dawg. would you agree if i say the people who has that kind of comment has already being suspended or banned from this sub.

>poking fun is not hate

fair enough. yup. hes on a roll.

joking aside i think he may currently having a bad week. relatively meek, unspirited and leaning towards baiting for sympathy compared to his usual energetic confidant style of posting. i hope it goes well for him lah.. Once again on display here, non Muslims talking about Islam without knowing full well about it.

Islam does not condone racism, paedophilia, or any other inciteful behaviour you can think of. The people condoning it are flawed in their understanding of being a true Muslim.. so only a few redditors lah (who might already been banned) and not the entire sub like you made it out to be. You do know that anyone can register and post rubbish here right?

I only ask for 1 example also elek? your account is 8 years old bro, if it's a child, can ride a bicycle already! 

Maybe you'll have more valid reason to be buthurt in lowyat forum, or maybe you just feel so sensitive about your own race and religion that everywhere you go you will feel insulted and attacked. Sometimes, thick skin is good and a better sense of humour helps.... please google No true scotsman fallacy.  

Are you saying all 10,000 ppl at the congress are not true muslims?. No one is a perfect Muslim. Also no true scotsman fallacy is about shifting the goal post of the argument. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, my argument is, there are flawed Muslims, I never said Muslims are not innocent. 

And to judge a religion based on Muslims, who does something that does not conform to Islamic teachings, are flawed logic. 

Also why are you posting this article anyway OP? If you are on Wong Kan Ye‚Äôs side, which is to eliminate racist treatments, why are you sharing this article that segregates people and make the problem worse? Why are you making this whole thing Malay vs. Chinese? Why not Malaysians vs. the problem?. >Why are you making this whole thing Malay vs. Chinese? Why not Malaysians vs. the problem?

what? the writer is malay. this isnt a malay vs. chinese issue...its a Malaysians vs Ketuanans issue.  

This article doesnt segregate ppl...its a pov on the hypocrisy of how ppl are treated in Malaysia. From my other comment:

> If the protester is a Malay Muslim, they are still going to get the same outcome for ‚Äúattacking‚Äù the uni‚Äôs upper management. We‚Äôve seen this before.

It‚Äôs just not a fair comparison between the pedo and this protesting student. Those 2 scenarios are completely different whatsoever. To compare it just because one is Malay and another is Chinese is only going to make people‚Äôs blood boil, causing further separation between races.

And sadly that has been the case in this comment section. Which is against what Wong Kan Ye is fighting for.. > If the protester is a Malay Muslim, they are still going to get the same outcome for ‚Äúattacking‚Äù the uni‚Äôs upper management.

i disagree. Yesterdays counter protests at the mosque sorely focused on the biadap bangsa dap. > Yesterdays counter protests at the mosque sorely focused on the biadap bangsa dap

I‚Äôm sorry for that. Usually the minority extremes are the loudest, they don‚Äôt represent anything but their spiteful behaviour. Provocative actions lead to another. And I am completely against that.

I‚Äôm still holding on to my argument that whenever or whoever protests against the upper management will get that treatment. Before this, we have a Malay student protesting (during study) against his IPT alone and he has received harsh punishments (got expelled and detained) that can affect his life because of the black mark in his history. No employer wants that kind of employee. And that is for not-as-nationwide issue as racism.. > I‚Äôm sorry for that. Usually the minority extremes are the loudest

are you sure they are the minority? over 10,000 ppl came for anti ICERD, close to 10k ppl at Malay dignity Congress  

How many anti ketuanan malays would show up at a Congress for that purpose? a anti tanah melayu, anti ketuanan congress... which focuses on MALAYSIAN Dignity  

How many Siti Kassim, Mujahid, Marinas are there?. 10k may seem large in numbers but it is still a small fraction of the population.

Alright look, we can argue about this endless argument all we want. But the problem is still there. Let‚Äôs present this issue to a better, more direct channel.

U draw tattoos on yourself nobody dare to say anything.. What's more with a car?. Avoid confusion with other myvis?

We have number plates bro. Anyway,  no one cares how you paint , decorate , desecrate , your car. I've never seen jpj or police stop people for it.. Hahaha, seriously?

137,56 PR1MA housing projects cancelled,djhi23,2019-10-18 03:17:48,notexthere,13,1.0,42.0,"A PR1MA project in my area was canceled when the building was almost complete (they still had interior stuff like tiling and wall painting etc). The developer just gave the units a more upscale finishing and sold the units to regular buyers.. i used to laugh at SG having to stay in apt...im laughing at myself now having to stay in apt....cos landed houses are for millionaires now...fml.... Where I can find the list?. I remember being *so* happy when I got chosen for a PR1MA apartment in Cyberjaya. I gave pause when the price turns out to be like RM360k.. Why can't KL ever have a decent public housing program?. *Sad B40M40 noises*. Half-hearted projects which are eyesore of the neighborhood shouldn't have been existed in the first place. It drops down the quality of the surrounding.. Speaking of PR1MA, anyone moved into Matang yet?. wtfuck. Curious. Which project is this?. I opted for cheaper affordable landed house, but at the cost of location. I'm currently staying in a suburban area.. Who ask you go look at upscale neighborhood? You can get landed house anywhere else. Terraces etc.. PPAM cannot?. Because developers have already secured most of the land from under us and built or will build upscale projects. Corruption has reduced gov‚Äôs land holdings significantly. Heck they even tried to sell Taman Rimba Kiara at one point.. Poor people shouldn't live near rich people, in another words?. Our corrupt city planning almost guarantees projects to the highest bidder. Public interest doesnt factor as much as personal interest.. instead of fixing the 'eyesore' , let's just cancel the projects

instead of stemming the issue of affordability, let's just allow foreigners to buy them. 

it's people like you, and reading myopic logics like yours, why this generation of Malaysians will not afford home ownership, or pay through the nose for one. 

home ownership is fundamental for a sense of rootedness, literally giving people a stake in society and nation building. it should be the paramount duty of any government to facilitate that. 

shame it will never happen under Pakatan Developer.. Wat?. PV Teratai in Setapak.. Rawang?. tbh, i rather stay in a 300 sqft studio than a landed house in a shitty neighbourhood.. Penjawat Awam is civil servant, isn't it? I work in the private sector, so can't :(. Kunan‚Äôs shit. Hope he rot in hell. Oh yeah I remember that. It was a shitshow.

The best solution the government could give is to pay people who can't afford to buy homes in KL to live outside KL. [Detroit does this]( and the result is that Detroit went from a dying city [to the most revitalized city in the world]( People who are struggling to live in San Francisco and New York City are moving to Detroit en masse, and it's an example that Malaysia should adopt, getting those who struggle to live in KL and then pay them to live in Kuantan, Alor Star, JB, Kuching, etc.. They should live near rich people, the point being?. Remember gov changing the westerners in the city planning department and put in ""orang Kita""?

Now you have shitty city planning, very much different than European cities.. Aw that sucks. There's a lot of PPAMs being built in my area (P16).. Then why are the projects eyesore to their neighbourhoods and bring down the quality? I mean you understand that's what poor people can afford right?. The projects are eyesore and they are badly managed. Put them in any neighborhood and they will still be an eyesore, doesn't matter rich or medium class. 

Have you bought a prima house before? Or have you bought a house before?. I'm asking why they are eyesore, repeating your statement doesn't address it. And how else you suggest the poor owning any house in any neighbourhood that ""might get affected""?

For your question, yes I have a house, a low cost house that's probably an eyesore. I hope your question is relevant.. They are eyesore because they are usually badly-managed. They can buy other house other than prima house with almost the same price.

I hope the government will start building low cost high quality houses in award-winning neighborhood because housing is a universal human rights and people working harder to buy better houses are just slaves of evil wicked capitalism. Wish everyone good luck!. But why are you so sure that the other houses with similar price in the same neighbourhood are not badly managed? It's like prima = poor management before everything else. I would like to know why.

>I hope the government will start building low cost high quality houses in award-winning neighborhood because housing is a universal human rights and people working harder to buy better houses are just slaves of evil wicked capitalism. Wish everyone good luck!

I will take that at face value. High quality is subjective, and I'm not sure why award winning matters as long as the amenities are supportive. You are right about the rest, only if you are sincere about it... Cheap maintenance fee and lack of supervision for management fund are main causes of poor management in these prima projects. Would really love to see prima houses with high standard of management that can compete with those private projects built by wicked greedy bad bad developers.

Ohh I'm sure we are on the path to the social democracy. Why build award-winning houses when you can build sophisticated houses for everyone with the same price? Hiding behind the mask of ""building for Excellency"" is just a byproduct of greed.

No /s so I'm damn sincere about it.. >Cheap maintenance fee and lack of supervision for management fund are main causes of poor management in these prima projects.

Then those shall be fixed. The reason why they still aren't is because of gov attitude towards public housing. Even you said it's a problem of management, surely the gov can handle that, even without the incentive of profit that private projects have. But with people willing and even supporting private projects as the solution, why would they?. Kpkt is losing money through these public housing projects. I doubt they will take it serious.

Yea yea housing is a universal human rights yada yada. Don't forget too, this is a developing south east asian country. We ain't even equal, you think how high up ""housing"" is in the ""human rights priority list"", if there is any?

They can handle mismanagement of public housing projects just not with their current power. They should have handled them to special property management companies which charged back those owners that rarely pay maintenance fee. Face the reality, if the owners don't want to improve the quality of the properties, no one can help them.

People supporting private projects shouldn't be seen as a cause of mismanagement of these public housing projects. People can have the freedom to choose not to live in public housing projects. Instead of buying hard stuck shithole 100k to 300k public housing project, I would rather work harder to increase my salary to buy private projects.. >Yea yea housing is a universal human rights yada yada. Don't forget too, this is a developing south east asian country. We ain't even equal, you think how high up ""housing"" is in the ""human rights priority list"", if there is any?

Considering it's need we are talking about, pretty high I would say. What's the point of being a developed country when it's own people can't afford houses?

>They can handle mismanagement of public housing projects just not with their current power. They should have handled them to special property management companies which charged back those owners that rarely pay maintenance fee. Face the reality, if the owners don't want to improve the quality of the properties, no one can help them.

Not paying maintenance fees shouldn't be used to justify the properties turn to shit. I think you have admitted that it's the attitude of the gov, so again, same thing.

>People supporting private projects shouldn't be seen as a cause of mismanagement of these public housing projects. People can have the freedom to choose not to live in public housing projects. Instead of buying hard stuck shithole 100k to 300k public housing project, I would rather work harder to increase my salary to buy private projects.

I hope I have not insinuated anywhere that it is a cause of mismanagement. But I do suggest that low to no expectation by the public is causing that, because people who have expectation would just go for private projects. Sure enough, you should have the liberty to do that, but pls spare a thought for the unfortunate people who would never earn enough to afford that no matter how hard they work.. Oohhh, wish this gov knows about this. Not enough maintenance fee collected, not enough money to maintain the quality of the property. Crazy idea, right?

Kpkt in the past was already losing a lot of money just by having these projects, taking more money out of it's pocket to maintain these properties? This gov won't allow it under current situation.

They are projects that are losing a lot of money from the start, how do you expect kpkt and the developers to keep the properties nicely managed? Gov should have freed up the limitations of public housing projects to allow more freedom. 300k price, 900sf size, within KL is gonna lose everyone a lot of money, not mentioning a lot of the buyers are obvious investors. Freed up limitations benefit everyone, it also allows gov to negotiate better deals with developers and buyers can quality housing.

If kpkt freed up the limitations, we could have more 2-bedders and lower price to bump start youngsters to own their first properties while developers and kpkt will not be losing a lot of money.

Losing a lot of money=not profiting will cause gov and developers not keeping up qualities like private projects, despite people on this sub having the Noble belief that they should not be valuing profit and loss. Housing industry is not a charity, we don't have saudi's oil field to start with.. >Oohhh, wish this gov knows about this. Not enough maintenance fee collected, not enough money to maintain the quality of the property. Crazy idea, right?

Ohh the gov could incur deficit for various other pointless things but for people housing it's a crazy idea huh?

>300k price, 900sf size, within KL is gonna lose everyone a lot of money, not mentioning a lot of the buyers are obvious investors.

The gov using its own land to build houses for the people is gonna lose everyone a lot of money?

>Housing industry is not a charity, we don't have saudi's oil field to start with.

I'm sure you realize that land is a more scarce commodity, and relying on it to spur economy is just as risky as relying on oil. And housing industry is not one where the players should earn a lot in. If it's because of the ongoing maintenance service then fair enough, but preying on 'desperation' contributed by many reasons as stated, is not.. > Ohh the gov could incur deficit for various other pointless things but for people housing it's a crazy idea huh? 

Bruh, millions of gov servants and thinktanks, not even one of them can think of this, you are such a gem in the wild. Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks.

Except the fact that they have to buy lands from the developers at the market price plus giving them extra more lands or projects, i.e bad negotiation. And you might ask how come the government of this country has to buy land from private companies? Ohh actually this country is no communist country and about 20 to 30 years ago, some old Mr. M benefited a lot of these developers and now they grow so powerful. Hmm...wonder what is that Mr. M is doing these days? 

By everyone, I meant gov(kpkt) and developers but of course in your argument, you have to victimize yourself to include flippers, agents, developers. Gov and developers have to ""literally"" to lose money and set up charities to serve the noble mission of providing housing to Malaysians, right? Damn, mindset so advanced.

It harms me, if I don't know much about properties, housing and finance but here I am.

Land is not that scarce in Malays, land people **want** to live in is scarce. Sometimes, they don't know how to measure their want vs. what they can afford. Developers are not desperate, buyers are. Developers have a lot of cash to stop new developments for a long time, public demands don't.

Victimize myself? Like those people I mentioned don't actually stand to profit from them lol?

Yeah, we should all just play along instead of trying to fix it.

>It harms me, if I don't know much about properties, housing and finance but here I am.

Wow, look at Mr. Property who can't be hurt by housing bubble so he doesn't give a fuck about other people here. You said you had to work harder for higher salary, didn't you? I'm sure you are happy to do that anyway, right?

>Land is not that scarce in Malays, land people want to live in is scarce. 

Yeap, people should commute for 4 hours everyday because who gives a fuck about them right?. Oh How I need to rebut that? You changed my mind, now I believe these developers should literally hand our free money and houses to Malaysians.

I believe the housing industry in nature should be charity. Thanks for the enlightenment.. Right, I totally said that! I think you just achieve the unachievable - enlightening yourself.",2650.0,5,1,0

146,Italy's Only Malaysian Food Truck Draws an Unlikely Crowd: Italians,djfe06,2019-10-18 00:27:48,notexthere,467,0.98,76.0,"Does it attract Italian mafia ,Passione?. ok ,get ready to be claim by Indonesia. I'm Italian and I love Malaysian cuisine. I cook Malaysian recipes myself at home and check the results against my malay colleague and friend. I get it right most of the time, but only because I have the great fortune of being very close to this person, who appreciates my efforts and corrects me. Also, the colleague is elated that she's getting all the Malaysian food for free!

Then I had other Italian friends try those recipes and I've come to the conclusion that Italians can and do appreciate Malaysian food.

I'm not surprised at all that the food truck attracts the native Italians as well.. Congrats on the success, didn't know how allergic Italians are to foreign food.. One thing I learnt here today is how quick we were to judge a title without reading the excerpts.. How unlikely is it to attract Italian customers in Italy?. Sate and sake sounds like an incredible combo. I'm drooling right now.. If I was to be Justin, I would not want to open up a restaurant. I'll prefer being in the small truck. Some may ask why - put it simply, keeping it simple and manageable. Sure a restaurant can also be manageable but I've met people who are so successful with their Cafe but they have not opened a second store til date.. From the article,
""For Rosman, Yip‚Äôs satay hits on nostalgia; he grew up in a Kuala Lumpur neighborhood called Kajang that‚Äôs famous for its satay.""

Pfft since when is Kajang a neighborhood, n how is it in Kuala Lumpur. 

Anyway, bravo for the success.. Time to go to Turinnnnn. Malaysian food in NL is not that authentic either. And I don‚Äôt want to pay 15euros for nasi lemak that doesn‚Äôt have sambal. üò≠. Lived wtih an Itlalian housemate before. Also thinks Italian food is the best. Well, I do think Malaysian food is also among the best, but I'm open to other things. I'd say French and italians are the ones most passionate, gatekeeper about their food - ""No, pizza shouldn't have any pineapple ever."". Open salami 


Arrivederci. They‚Äôre lucky to have food truck with low price.. That is a very cute food truck I want one.. If you've been to Italy and read a bit about their politics, you can see how ridiculously close minded they are to foreign food. As in the article you see how quite a handful of Italians are super proud about their food and refuse to try any other foreign food. Not surprising since it's also the country in Western Europe with the strongest fascist movement and relatively more racist attitude.. 142 skewers per day on average. Wow!. Ayy mamma mia. Korean BBQ in Malaysia attract Malaysian and Malaysian cuisine food truck opened in Italy attract Italian. Who would've thunk..  Italian food in Malaysia draws Malaysian crowd. Amazing.. > Yip moved to Italy nine years ago and earned a degree from the **University of Gastronomic Science in Bra**

*bruh...*. It's Malaysian food on a hol nother level. This taste... Is the taste of satay! Giorno Giovanna!!. You gotta have a dream first. I wonder if it's Giorno's fave place to pick up lunch. I can imagine OUR LOVING MOTHER BUCCELATI giving out satay to potential recruits for Passione.. I see you are a man of culture as well. While Singapore is lurking behind. Hahahahaahaha so true. .....before china claims the food truck as theirs due to ancestry and then claim malaysian cuisine as a whole.. Seems like Italians have good taste too!  ;). Every time I watch a Youtube vid to make simple Italian dishes, you can expect half the comments to be by Italians criticizing a single step in paragraphs.

And we thought Malaysians get ballistic if people talk about our food.. should be selling wonton mee to italians, show them what noodles are, instead of their failed noodles: spaghetti. I think their point is that Italians are famously averse to any food that's not Italian. If you read the article, the fact that a non-Italian eatery becomes popular is extremely rare, let alone a food truck in a country best known for originating the concept of Slow Food.. Create business in Italy. *Suprised Pikachu* customers are italians.. Exactly what I was thinking, were they expecting no Italian customers?. That headline is a major fail. The lines between KL and Selangor are really blurry for people that aren't from KL or Selangor, even among Malaysians.. In most parts of the world, people tend to group metropolitan area of a city as part of the city itself.

i don't see why it should be the exception for KL in this case.. You're right!!! Nasi Lemak without sambal is a disgrace!!!. you get ripped off man haha, better off cooking it yourself considering the amount of indonesians people are there. I think Malaysians are more open to outsider making or modifying our food for their taste but there are limits. Remember a post where some western recipe mill made a laksa that was nothing like any kind of laksa we've seen and we got called food snobs for pointing it out.. DI MOLTO. Either massively underreported or the Italians eat pathetically small portion.. Because Italians are anti foreign food (kinda). anythin draw msian,even 2kg potong kaki. Did you read the article?. Bruh.... Coming thru my mindüé∂. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free real estate.‚Äù. And the Brunei peeps just watch all the drama lel. Yep..

Typical basic Italian recipe

1) add beef

2) add tomato

3) simmer

4) put salt.. (I like to put in some vinegar and sugar)


Then there will be Italians who comments that vinegar and sugar destroys the dish. Aha, no wonder I watched this Italian chef's reaction to spaghetti videos ([\_70XyVAk]( and all of them are so sensitive. Ahaha. Sell them all the mee we have. Mee goreng, kolo mee, kampua all that kind haha.. Adonbilivit. They were expecting to cater to the exchange students/international students. Read the article.. Not really if you read the article. [deleted]. This. Even the last 2 lines of my IC says ‚ÄúKuala Lumpur, Selangor‚Äù. To a Sarawakian, I group KL and the Klang Valley together. They are not far away from each other and the food scene is not that much of difference. I only need to drive probably 40mins from one district to another.. Because it‚Äôs part of Greater KL/Klang Valley.

If you‚Äôre in other countries or speaking to people who might not be that familiar with Klang Valley, referring to places like Bandar Utama or Kajang as ‚ÄúKL‚Äù is easier than saying Selangor as it provides a better point of reference.. [deleted]. Hmm... Not sure i'd be surprise if some of them are explorer and tend to try new food from other country.. No. And then 3 Italians dance menacingly in front of you. Haaaa we emas wind. You forgot the part where the kitchen radio plays a 10 hour loop of Funiculi Funicula and Tarantella Napolitana as BGM.. Vinegar and sugar does the same thing as tomatoes, so if you use them together you‚Äôre overwhelming the dish, but I guess Malaysian taste buds prefer heavier flavors. not to forget maggi goreng. i'm from KL, and even i find that line to be super blurry.

i have PoGo+ tethered to my Pokemon Go which can help me auto catch pokemons & auto spin pokestops and i was surprised that i tend to pass by Selangor even though i only travel from one point of KL to another.. yeah, its so much easier explaining KL is than explaining where kajang is to foreigner. if you were born before 1974 or have pre-1974 address, it's actually correct since Kuala Lumpur used to be part of Selangor. i beg to differ, take the MRT all the way to Kajang and you'll see built-up areas all along the way from the KL side of Cheras. He meant to cater to foreign students and did not expect to cater to Italians who were hard to sway away from their traditional foods. That was why he was surprised to be catering to mainly Italians.. Was kinda the opposite of your statement. #ZAPIN INTENSIFIES. Thanks for the tldr",1369.0,10,1,0
